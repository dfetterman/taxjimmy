Topic: Administration and Procedure Agencies Responsible for Administration Local Sales and Use Tax

New Mexico Taxation & Revenue Department New Mexico law provides that local municipal and county gross receipts and compensating taxes are collected and administered in the same manner as the state gross receipts tax. See, e.g., N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-2(A)(4); N.M. Stat. §7-19D-8(A); New Mexico Bulletin FYI-C120. The county and municipal gross receipts taxes are collected at the same time and in the same manner as the state gross receipts tax. New Mexico Bulletin FYI-M121. The New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department is required to charge an administrative fee of 3 percent of the collected receipts. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-6.41(E); N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-6.12; N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-6.13. This rate has been increased by 0.25 percent, as of April 7, 2009, for the purpose of funding the Fair Share Initiative, which was created to improve compliance with state taxes including county local option taxes. New Mexico Bulletin FYI-C120. This increase is authorized through fiscal year 2011. New Mexico Bulletin FYI-C120.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Vendor/Seller Registration

Required Any person leasing or selling property to the state or performing services for the state is required to register with the Department to pay the gross receipts tax. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-10-4. The only exceptions to this rule are for persons with no business location, employees or property in New Mexico and who do not conduct business in New Mexico through agents or contractors. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-10-4. If any person required to register is not registered to pay the gross receipts tax, the state will hold payment of the amount due until the person has presented evidence of registration with the Department to pay the gross receipts tax. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-10-4. Registration Requirements for Exemptions and Deductions If a person is clearly engaged solely in an exempt activity, the person is not required to register. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.5.8(A). A list of exempt receipts are provided in N.M. Stat. Ann. §§7-9-13 to 7-9-42. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.5.8(A). When a person is engaged in business or businesses in which some of the transactions are subject to the tax and some are exempt, that person must register and file reports. The person, however, is not required to include in reported gross receipts those receipts that are exempt. The person also is not required to include in computing the compensating tax the value of the property that is exempt from compensating tax. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.100.8(B). Even though a person's receipts may be entirely deductible under provisions of the Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act, the person must register, report those receipts, and claim the applicable deduction or deductions. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.5.8(A). BNA-SUTN NM 31.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Tax Collection and Remittance

Seller Seller Liability For the privilege of engaging in business, any person engaged in business in New Mexico is liable for gross receipts tax. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-4. Disclosed Agent Liability New Mexico imposes sales and use tax on both the sale of services and goods. However, the receipts of any person received as a reimbursement of expenditures incurred in connection with the performance of a service or the sale or lease of property are taxable gross receipts as defined by N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-3.5, unless that person incurs such expense as agent on behalf of a principal while acting in a disclosed agency capacity. An agency relationship exists if a person has the power to bind a principal in a contract with a third party so that the third party can enforce the contractual obligation against the principal. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-3.5(A)(3)(f); N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.1.19(C); New Mexico Public Decision 15-21 (June 29, 2015); New Mexico Public Decision No. 17-05 (Jan. 19, 2017); New Mexico Decision and Order No. 15-10 (March 6, 2015)(the Department properly assessed the taxpayer for gross receipts tax, penalty, and interest for receipts of payments from bars for services performed by his band; taxpayer was not in a disclosed agency relationship with the bars and was responsible for paying gross receipts tax on amounts received for performances). A disclosed agent must affirmatively state that they are acting on behalf of a principal, and adhere to specific bookkeeping and billing requirements. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.1.19(C)(2); Bogle Mgmt. Co., Inc. v. New Mexico Taxn. & Rev. Dept., No. A-1-CA-35641, (N.M. Ct. App. Dec. 5, 2017). BNA-SUTN NM 31.3.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Purchaser Liability

Yes Any person using taxable property in New Mexico is liable for payment of the compensating tax if the compensating tax has not been paid. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-9. The liability is discharged if the buyer has paid the compensating tax to the seller for payment over to the Department. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-9. BNA-SUTN NM 31.3.2.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Business Owners, Operators

Yes Generally if any person required to register is not registered to pay the gross receipts tax, the state will hold payment of the amount due until the person has presented evidence of registration with the Department to pay the gross receipts tax. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-10-4. Officers or employees of a business may also be individually and personally liable for tax assessments against the business. Similarly, members or employees of a partnership, or any individual who, as such, is under a duty to perform any act in respect of which a violation occurs can also be held liable for assessments. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-3(P); New Mexico Public Decision No. 13-7 (March 11, 2013). In such cases, analysis for liability will focus on three questions:(1) Is the individual in question a person liable for payment of any tax? (2) Is the individual in question a person responsible for withholding? (3) Is the individual in question a person responsible for payment or for collection and payment of any tax or person to whom an assessment has been made, if the assessment remains unabated or the amount thereof has not been paid? New Mexico Public Decision No. 13-7 (March 11, 2013). However, in the case of a business organized as a sole proprietorship, this analysis is not required with respect to the sole proprietor, as a sole proprietor is per se liable for the activities of the business. See Casias v. New Mexico Taxn. & Rev. Dept., No. A-1CA-36316 (March 25, 2019) (where an owner fails to prove that his business is an LLC rather than a sole proprietorship and individually enters into an installment agreement, the owner is responsible for taxes assessed against the business); New Mexico Public Decision No. 18-37 (Nov. 20, 2016). New Mexico does not directly identify such instances as “officer liability,” but an individual can be found liable as a “person subject to tax” if they are considered to be responsible for conducting business in the state under any of the above criteria. New Mexico Public Decision No. 13-7 (March 11, 2013). See New Mexico Public Decision No. 19-12 (May 10, 2019) (finding that even though the spouse was on the business's board of directors, she does not qualify as a delinquent taxpayer as she did not partake in any activities for that business; that a spouse jointly filing personal income taxes with her husband does not subject her to gross receipts tax liability of her husband or his business; and that the department of revenue does not have authority to divide community property or enforce community liens against a spouse's interest in separate property, like an individual retirement account (IRA)). Successor Liability Even though a business changes hands the tangible and intangible property used in any business remains subject to liability for payment of the gross receipts tax and compensating use tax due on account of that business. N.M. Stat. Ann. § 7-1-61(B). See New Mexico Admin. Hearing Office, No. 15-33 (Oct. 9, 2015) (finding that the taxpayer is a successor in business gross receipts tax penalty and interest because although there was no formal sale and purchase, there was a transfer of assets from the old business to the new business when the equipment was placed in the taxpayer's shop and put at his disposal. There were seven factors listed for determining when a taxpayer is a successor in business, and if a single one of these factors is present, there is a presumption that there is a successor in business. In determining if the successor will be liable for the full value of the assessment, the court looks at whether the transfer was done to avoid tax or if the transfer amounts to a de facto merger, consolidation or mere continuation of the transferor's business, or if the successor agreed to assume liability. In this case, the argument was that the taxpayer's business was a mere continuation of the old business because there was a common customer and employee and both business engaged in some of the same kind of work. It was found that the key factor was the substance of the work done, and a slight overlap as was the case here was not sufficient to establish continuation, therefore the taxpayer was allowed to discharge the full value of the assessment). See also New Mexico Public Decision No. 18-25 (Aug. 2, 2018) (highlighting that “property used in any business”includes anything transferred that is reasonably necessary for the business's continued operations, whether or not the property is actually owned by the business).

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Certified Service Providers

Not Applicable New Mexico is not a member of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement. Although taxpayers are not prevented from relying on information provided by certified service providers (“CSPs”), New Mexico, has not addressed how it will treat a taxpayer's erroneous tax filing resulting from misinformation provided by a CSP. However, no penalty will be assessed from the failure to pay an amount of tax due to a mistake of law made in good faith and on reasonable grounds. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-69(B); see, e.g., New Mexico Public Decision No. 16-17 (May 16, 2016); New Mexico Public Decision No. 16-06 (Feb. 18, 2016)(lack of knowledge, inaction and inadvertent error are not reasonable grounds to waive a penalty); New Mexico Public Decision No. 14-47 (Dec. 31, 2014) (Taxpayer discussed the implications of his income with his CPA, and reasonably relied on the advice given that gross receipts tax was not owed. The penalty assessed for non-payment of gross receipts tax was abated due to this reliance.). BNA-SUTN NM 31.3.5.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Payment Methods Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)

Permitted The department is authorized to accept payments by an automated clearinghouse transaction, Federal Reserve System wire transfer, and other means of electronic payment as the department may choose. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-13.4(A). Neither the Department nor the fiscal agent of New Mexico can refuse to accept the funds or reverse the transaction when funds have been received by the fiscal agent designating the Department as the payee together with sufficient information to identify the name of the taxpayer. The Department or the fiscal agent of New Mexico may refuse to accept such a payment or cause the reversal of the transaction only when the transaction is not successful in making the funds available or in identifying the taxpayer. Additionally, the Department and the fiscal agent of New Mexico may refuse to accept electronic payments tendered by means other than automated clearinghouse deposit, Federal Reserve System wire transfer, or those other means the Department has chosen. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-13.4(B). When an electronic payment transaction is reversed through the taxpayer's action or a check is dishonored by the taxpayer's financial institution, neither the Department nor the fiscal agent of New Mexico is obligated to resubmit the transaction or check for payment. If the reversal or dishonoring causes the final payment of taxes to be untimely, then penalties and interest apply. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-13.4(C). With respect to electronic filing, taxpayers filing returns under the Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act and local option gross receipts tax Act must file returns electronically if the taxpayer paid an average of $1000 or more per month in the previous calendar year.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Certificates Required

Yes The buyer or lessee may give the seller or lessor a New Mexico nontaxable transaction certificate (NTTC) to document the seller's or lessor's deduction of their receipts. New Mexico Bulletin FYI-204; New Mexico Bulletin FYI-105. Deductible receipts are not subject to gross receipts tax because they are subtracted from gross receipts before the tax is calculated. In deductible transactions, the seller or lessor incurs no gross receipts tax to bill to the customer, and the customer makes the purchase “tax free.” Although they are not subject to gross receipts tax, deductible receipts must be reported to the New Mexico Department of Taxation and Revenue on a CRS-1 Form. Exempt receipts are receipts which, under state law, need not be reported to the Department. New Mexico Bulletin FYI-204. New Mexico does not accept any tax exemption or deduction certificates issued by other states as documentation for deductions from New Mexico gross receipts tax;however, New Mexico does accept multi-jurisdictional uniform sales and use tax certificates (“MTCs”) and border states uniform sale for resale certificates (“BSCs”). New Mexico Bulletin FYI-204. MTCs may be used only to document exempt sales of tangible personal property and may not be used to document exempt service sales. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.201.13; New Mexico Public Decision No. 15-19 (June 22, 2015). Nontaxable Transaction Certificates(NTTCs) Application To obtain nontaxable transaction certificates, an applicant must have a New Mexico Combined Reporting System Identification Number, an eleven-digit number also known as a business tax identification number, which is obtained by filing a completed Form ACD-31015 to the Department. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-43; see also New Mexico Public Decision No. 15-08 (a taxpayer who incorrectly filed NTTC given to him by his employer and relied on improper advice from his accountant, was found free of negligence and the penalty was abated); New Mexico Bulletin FYI-204. A taxpayer who has a CRS Identification Number is registered with the Department. New Mexico Bulletin FYI-204. Beginning Nov. 1, 2015, business owners must request and execute NTTCs through the New Mexico Taxpayer Access Point. NTTC Net will no longer be available as of that date. See New Mexico Taxn. &Rev. Dept., Press Release: Taxpayer Access Point Upgrades (Oct. 1, 2015). Disqualification for Nontaxable Transaction Certificates Application If a person is shown in the Department's records to have an outstanding tax liability or to have a non-filed period, the Department may refuse to approve that person's application for nontaxable transaction certificates until the liability is paid or missing reports are submitted. The taxpayer may protest the refusal pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. § 7-1-24. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-43(D); see also New Mexico Public Decision No. 15-01 (though the taxpayer had announced his intention to file more nontaxable transaction certificates, he was not able to produce them; the court ruled that further certificates would not be timely and would not be allowed). Using Nontaxable Transaction Certificates A seller or lessor should possess all nontaxable transaction certificates executed by buyers or lessees for nontaxable transactions at the time the return is due for receipts from the transactions. If the seller or lessor is not in possession of the required nontaxable transaction certificates at the time the return is due, the taxpayer may still obtain these within 60 days of the Taxation and Revenue Department notifying the taxpayer that they are required. If the taxpayer fails to obtain the certificates within this period, the taxpayer may not deduct the nontaxable receipts that these certificates would otherwise be used to document when calculating the taxpayer's gross receipts tax liability. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-43(A); see also New Mexico Public Decision No. 16-48 (Sept. 30, 2016) (taxpayer who did not provide NTTC after receiving 60-day letter was unable to deduct resold services from his gross receipts); New Mexico Public Decision No. 16-02 (Feb. 8, 2016) (taxpayer did not submit an executed NTTC for several months after the 60-day “second chance” deadline, even though he had evidence that one was issued; after the deadline passed, the Department no longer had authority to allow the deduction); New Mexico Public Decision No. 15-34 (Nov. 10, 2015) (taxpayer's negligence in not understanding that she needed NTTCs and her failure to obtain them within 60 days of notice by the Department did not excuse her unpaid taxes and penalties; the denial of deductions under N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-43 is mandatory, not discretionary); New Mexico Public Decision No. 15-25 (July 20, 2015) (notice deemed to be given when the taxpayer received the Department's 60-day letter, not when the letter was mailed); New Mexico Public Decision No. 13-23 (wholesaler was found negligent in not obtaining an NTTC in a timely fashion, and was assessed penalties and interest owed on back taxes); New Mexico Public Decision No. 13-27 (taxpayer was denied deductions for failure to obtain an NTTC within 60 day period following notification of Department audit); New Mexico Public Decision No. 13-33 (Nov. 4, 2013) (welder providing deductible services denied deduction and assessed penalty for failure to obtain NTTC within 60 day period following notice by the Department); New Mexico Public Decision No. 14-01 (painter failed to acquire the appropriate type of NTTC for one client, while for others, he acquired the correct NTTC, but failed to meet the 60-day requirement); New Mexico Public Decision No. 14-9 (March 31, 2014) (a healthcare services provider did not possess an NTTC to support a claim deduction for sale of a service for resale at the time returns were due and did not obtain an NTTC within 60 day period following notification of Department audit); New Mexico Public Decision No. 15-07 (Feb. 23, 2015) (a contractor providing services to individuals with developmental disabilities is liable for tax, penalties, and interest because she was negligent in not filing her gross receipts and did not timely possess a NTTC). The nontaxable transaction certificates must contain the information and be in a form prescribed by the Department. Only buyers or lessees who have a registration number or have applied for a registration number and have not been refused one may execute nontaxable transaction certificates issued by the Department. Once the seller or lessor has been given an identification number by the Department, the seller or lessor must disclose that identification number to the buyer or lessee prior to or upon acceptance of a nontaxable transaction certificate. When the seller or lessor accepts a nontaxable transaction certificate within the required time and in good faith that the buyer or lessee will employ the property or service transferred in a nontaxable manner, the properly executed nontaxable transaction certificate is conclusive evidence, and the only material evidence that the proceeds from the transaction are deductible from the seller's or lessor's gross receipts. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-43(A); New Mexico Public Decision No. 13-13 (May 17, 2013); New Mexico Public Decision No. 16-45 (Sept. 15, 2016) (an architectural service provider who possessed a timely and properly completed Type 6 NTTC accepted in good faith, in lieu of a Type 5 NTTC, was entitled to claim deductions). A seller accepting a nontaxable transaction certificate in good faith must be able to present the invoices that accompanied the certificate upon audit. New Mexico Public Decision No. 13-16 (June 10, 2013). Consequences of Failing to Obtain Exemption Certificates If the seller or lessor is not in possession of the required nontaxable transaction certificates within sixty days from the date that the notice requiring possession of these nontaxable transaction certificates is given the seller or lessor by the Department, deductions claimed by the seller or lessor that require delivery of these nontaxable transaction certificates will be disallowed. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-43(A). Alternative Evidence, NTTC Substitutions, Data Elements Effective March 2, 2018, taxpayers who do not have NTTC's may establish entitlement to a deduction from gross receipts by presenting alternative evidence that demonstrates the facts necessary to support entitlement to the deduction. The burden of proof is on that taxpayer to show entitlement to a deduction. Alternative evidence includes, invoices or contracts, documentation as to the purchaser's use of the property or service, a statement from the purchaser indicating that the purchaser sold or intends to resell the property or service purchased from the seller, in the ordinary course of business, or any other evidence that demonstrates the facts necessary to establish entitlement to the deduction. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-43(B), as amended by 2018 N.M. H.B. 194, effective March 2, 2018. See New Mexico Bulletin B-200.32. Prior to March 2, 2018, New Mexico would only accept its own NTTCs, Multistate Transaction Certificates, and Border State Certificates. No substitutes were permitted.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Good Faith Requirement

Yes A seller or lessor may accept an NTTC or a MTC from a customer in good faith that the customer will use the property or service in a nontaxable manner. New Mexico Bulletin FYI-204; New Mexico Public Decision No. 16-11 (April 25, 2016). A seller or lessor who takes a deduction based on acceptance of a NTTC that clearly is inappropriate or inapplicable to a transaction remains liable for gross receipts tax. New Mexico Bulletin FYI-204; New Mexico Public Decision No. 16-11 (April 25, 2016); Sw. Mobile Serv. v. New Mexico Taxn. & Rev. Dept., 2016 BL 263310 (N.M. Ct. App. 2016) (taxpayer's acceptance of MTCs fell within the good faith provision). The safe harbor of the good faith requirement only applies when the underlying transaction is actually covered by a recognized deduction. New Mexico Public Decision No. 18-21 (July 19, 2018). If a seller accepts a NTTC certificate within the required time-frame and in good faith that the buyer will use the otherwise taxable property or services in a nontaxable manner, the seller receives safe harbor, and the only evidence required to support the seller's deduction will be the NTTC. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-43(A). The New Mexico Court of Appeals has stated that a seller must satisfy three requirements to prove that it is entitled to safe harbor protection for any given transaction. The three requirements are:• timeliness of acceptance of the NTTC; • good faith acceptance of the NTTC; and • acceptance of a properly executed NTTC. Leaco Rural Tel. Coop., Inc. v. New Mexico Bureau of Rev., 526 P.2d 426 (N.M. Ct. App. 1974). In a recent administrative decision, the Taxation and Revenue Department applied the Leaco standard to a case in which the taxpayer was actually entitled to a deduction, but had accepted the wrong type of NTTC from the buyer to support the deduction. The hearing officer determined that because all the Leaco requirements had been met, the taxpayer was entitled to the deduction. New Mexico Public Decision No. 16-45 (Sep. 15, 2016).

60 Days A taxpayer should have the proper NTTC at the time of the transaction. However, the taxpayer can accept the NTTC at any time following the transaction. New Mexico Bulletin FYI-204. When a taxpayer receives notice of an audit, the taxpayer must possess all NTTCs within 60 days of the date of that notice. After that time, the auditor will disallow undocumented gross receipts tax deductions and any NTTCs received after the 60 days. New Mexico is firm on this policy. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-43(B); New Mexico Bulletin FYI-204; see also New Mexico Public Decision No. 16-02 (Feb. 8, 2016) (taxpayer did not submit an executed NTTC for several months after the 60-day “second chance” deadline, even though he had evidence that one was issued; after the deadline passes, the Department cannot allow the deduction).

New Mexico Bulletin FYI-204. Additionally, businesses buying goods for resale in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas have formed the Border States Caucus along with the United Mexican States, with the purpose of working out programs to promote trade in the southwest region of the United States. New Mexico Bulletin FYI-204. As such, the Caucus has developed a resale certificate referred to as the “Border States Uniform Sale for Resale Certificate”. Businesses buying goods for resale in these states or the northern border strip and border region of Mexico which will be transported across state and/or national borders may use the Border States Certificate in lieu of a state resale certificate. New Mexico Bulletin FYI-204. The certificate must be completed by the buyer and given to the seller. The seller must retain this document as part of its accounting records. The seller must not accept an incomplete document as it may be invalid.

3 Years The statutes and administrative code does not set forth a time requirement for retention of records, but the statute of limitations for assessing a tax liability is three years. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §1.5.8(A). Every taxpayer required to keep records and documents must maintain books or other records in a manner that will permit the accurate computation of state taxes or provide information from records required by the person to be kept. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-10(A); Waldroop v. O'Cheskey, 85 N.M. 736, 516 P.2d 1119 (N.M. Ct. App. 1973). If state taxes cannot be accurately or readily computed by the secretary from the records, then the records are inadequate for purposes of record-keeping. The adequacy of the taxpayer records is a matter of fact determined by the Secretary. Upon request the taxpayer must provide the secretary with books and records to establish a basis for taxation. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §1.5.8(A). If the taxpayer fails to keep adequate books the Department will use alternative methods to determine the tax liability. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §1.5.8(B). Alternative methods may include, but are not limited to: • the bank deposit method; • documents and records of persons other than the taxpayer; • federal returns and other government reports; • weighted percentage cost of sales markup; • net worth analysis; • industry comparison;and • provisional assessment of taxes based on best available information and allowing for any increase that may have occurred due to inflation, increased economic activity or other reasons. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §1.5.8(C). The taxpayer's method of accounting must be consistent for the same business; however, a taxpayer engaged in more than one business may use a different method of accounting for each business. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-10(B). Prior to changing the method of accounting in keeping books and records, a taxpayer must first obtain the consent of the Secretary. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-10(C).

Failure to File a Return In case of the failure by a taxpayer to complete and file any required return, the tax relating to the period for which the return was required may be assessed at any time within seven years from the end of the calendar year in which the tax was due, and no court proceeding for the collection of such tax without the prior assessment can begin after the expiration of such period. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-18(C). Waiver of Limitation Period If the taxpayer has signed a waiver of the limitations on assessment, a tax assessment may be made or a court proceeding begun without regard to the time at which payment of the tax was due.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Civil Penalties

Yes Penalties are collected in the same manner as, and concurrently with, the amount of tax to which it relates. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §1.11.8(D). Any penalty or demand for payment made by the Department is presumed correct under N.M. Stat. Ann. § 7-1-17(C). N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §1.11.8(A). Consequently, the taxpayer has the burden of proving that the assessment is not correct. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §1.11.8(D). Any person who wrongfully fails or refuses to surrender or redeem any property or rights to property levied by the Secretary is liable for a civil penalty in an amount equal to the value of the property or the rights not surrendered or the amount of the tax for the collection of which the levy has been made. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-34(C). Negligence In the case of negligent failure to file a timely return, a penalty will be assessed at 2 percent per month, up to 20 percent, of the amount of tax due, even if payment has been made in a timely fashion. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-69(A); see GEA Integrated Cooling Tech. v. New Mexico Taxn. & Rev. Dept. (N.M. Ct. App. 2011). The imposition of the penalty for negligence is mandatory, not discretionary. See New Mexico Public Decision No. 16-48 (Sept. 30, 2016). Taxpayers who pay electronically will have a five-day grace period (for penalties only) to correct the transmission if payment identified to the taxpayer reaches the Department or its fiscal agent but otherwise lacks required information. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-69(A). The penalty is 2 percent per month or partial month up to a maximum of 20 percent of tax due or a minimum of $5. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-69(A). “Negligence” means the failure to exercise the degree or ordinary business care and prudence that reasonable taxpayers would exercise under similar circumstances, inaction by taxpayers where action is required, and inadvertence, indifference, thoughtlessness, carelessness, erroneous belief, or inattention. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §1.11.10; New Mexico Public Decision No. 16-48 (Sept. 30, 2016) (taxpayer assessed penalty even though he mistakenly believed his gross receipts were deductible). Situations that indicate that there was not negligence include:• a taxpayer proves that he/she was affirmatively misled by a Department employee; See New Mexico Public Decision No. 18-23 (July 31, 2018) (refunding penalties where taxpayer demonstrated reliance on misleading information provided by a customer service representative in the Department's call center). • a taxpayer that is disabled by prolonged illness or injury demonstrates his or her inability to prepare returns and make payments and was unable to have another person perform those services because of the injury or illness; • a taxpayer proves that there is physical damage to records or the place of business that caused a delay in filing or payment; • a taxpayer proves that there was reasonable reliance on the advice of competent counsel or an accountant (this does not apply to the timeliness of returns); • a taxpayer files an amended return and pays any additional tax due within 12 months of filing the original return; and • out-of-state taxpayers volunteer to register, report and pay tax when there is a good faith doubt that the business has nexus with New Mexico. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §1.11.11. Taxpayers retain the duty to ascertain the tax consequences of their actions and prove that they did not act negligently;they cannot claim that there was reliance on competent counsel to their detriment without other supporting evidence. See New Mexico Public Decision No. 16-05 (Feb. 18, 2016) (the accounting system for the taxpayer's business led to several instances of underreporting and underpayment; the negligence penalty was not waived because the taxpayer did not provide evidence supporting a claim that he relied on competent counsel when the system was developed; an inadequate or insufficient accounting system can be a basis for imposition of the penalty). Similarly, taxpayers cannot claim they were affirmatively mislead by a Department employee if the taxpayer initially made material misstatement of facts to the Department employee. New Mexico Public Decision No. 18-21 (July 19, 2018). If a taxpayer makes an electronic payment of tax, but the payment does not include all of the information required by the Department, pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. § 7-1-13.1 and the Department does not receive the required information within five business days from the later of the date a request by the Department for the information is received by the taxpayer or the due date, the taxpayer is subject to a penalty of 2 percent per month or any fraction of a month from the fifth day following the date the request is received. If a penalty is imposed under N.M. Stat. Ann. § 7-1-69(A) (failure due to negligence or disregard of Department rules and regulations)with respect to the same transaction for the same period, no penalty is imposed under N.M. Stat. Ann. § 7-1-69(F). N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-69(F). Intent to Defraud or Willfully Evade In the case of failure with willful intent to evade or defeat the payment of taxes due, New Mexico imposes a penalty equal to the greater of 50 percent of the tax due or $25. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-69(D); N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §1.11.18. A willful attempt to evade or defeat includes, but is not limited to: • engaging in business while not filing tax returns coupled with the knowledge that the business is subject to tax; • filing tax returns without payment or an extended period of time while staying in business and paying other creditors; • knowingly completing false tax returns or claiming exemptions, deductions, credits, or other reductions of taxable amounts or taxes to which the taxpayer knows he is not entitled; • hiding or transferring assets to hinder the collection activity of the Department;or • advising or counseling any of the foregoing in the course of one's business as an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, business consulting firm or tax preparer. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §1.11.18. The Department has the burden of proving tax evasion or causing or attempting to cause another to evade tax. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §1.11.18(B). Generally interest does not run on penalties;however, interest continues to accrue on the penalty imposed to extent of the unpaid principal of the underlying tax liability because N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-72.1 specifically authorizes the assessment of penalty and interest upon the tax which was evaded or attempted to be evaded. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §1.11.18(C). Failure to Correctly File Certain Deductions In the case of a taxpayer that improperly deducts gross receipts under N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-92 or N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-93 and not under the applicable provision of the Gross Receipts and Compensating Tax Act, New Mexico will impose a penalty of 20 percent of the value of the hold harmless distribution stemming from the improper deduction. 2016 N.M. S.B. 6, § 3, effective Oct. 19, 2016. Government Entities To the extent permitted by the Constitution, treaties, and laws of the United States, penalties may be imposed upon any other state, any Indian tribe, nation, or pueblo, the United States, any alien government or any agency, institution, instrumentality, or political subdivision of any of the aforementioned. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §1.11.14(A). Penalties may also be imposed for tax indebtedness against any agency, institution, instrumentality or political subdivision of the state of New Mexico. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §1.11.14(B). BNA-SUTN NM 31.12.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Criminal Penalties

Yes In New Mexico, persons found guilty of tax fraud may be required to pay a fine and may be sentenced to imprisonment in the county jail depending on the severity of the crime. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-73. Any person who commits tax fraud when the amount of the tax owed is $250 or less is guilty of a petty misdemeanor and may be sentenced pursuant to the provisions of N.M. Stat. Ann. §31-19-1. A person who commits tax fraud and owes more than $250 but less than$500 in tax is also guilty of a misdemeanor and may be sentenced pursuant to N.M. Stat. Ann. §31-19-1. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-73(a); N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-73(b). A person who commits tax fraud and owes more than $500 in taxes is guilty of a felony and will be sentenced under N.M. Stat. Ann. §31-18-15. A tax deficiency caused by fraud where the amount owed is between $500 and $2,500 is a fourth degree felony. Fraud creating a tax deficiency between $2,500 and$20,000 is a third degree felony, and fraud creating a tax deficiency of more than $20,000 is a second degree felony. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-73(a); N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-73(b). Additionally, any person who commits tax fraud may be required to pay the costs of the prosecution of that person's case. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-73(a); N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-73(b). BNA-SUTN NM 31.12.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Waiver of Penalties

Yes New Mexico may abate any part of an assessment determined to have been incorrectly, erroneously, or illegally made. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-28(A); see, e.g., New Mexico Public Decision No. 16-17 (May 16, 2016); New Mexico Public Decision No. 16-06 (Feb. 18, 2016)(lack of knowledge, inaction and inadvertent error are not reasonable grounds to waive a penalty); New Mexico Public Decision No. 16-04 (Feb. 10, 2016) (the negligence penalty was not abated when a taxpayer did not make efforts to consult with accountants or other tax professionals prior to his decision that he did not have to pay tax on services provided to government agencies that were taxable); New Mexico Public Decision No. 14-47 (Dec. 31, 2014) (Taxpayer discussed the implications of his income with his CPA, and reasonably relied on the advice given that gross receipts tax was not owed. The penalty assessed for non-payment of gross receipts tax was abated due to this reliance.). When deciding whether to abate civil penalties, the secretary of taxation and revenue will consider the following which may indicate that a taxpayer has not been negligent or disregarded rules and regulations:• whether the taxpayer proves the taxpayer was affirmatively misled by a department employee; • whether the taxpayer, disabled because of injury or prolonged illness, demonstrates the inability to prepare a return and make payment and was unable to procure the services of another person to prepare a return because of the injury or illness; • whether the taxpayer shows that physical damage to the taxpayer's records or place of business caused a delay in filing a return or making payment of tax; • whether the taxpayer proves that the failure to pay tax or to file a return was caused by reasonable reliance on the advice of competent tax counsel or accountant as to the taxpayer's liability after full disclosure of all relevant facts; failure to make a timely filing of a tax return, however, is not excused by the taxpayer's reliance on an agent; • whether a taxpayer, within twelve months of the original filing of a return and without action of the secretary or delegate, files an amended return reflecting tax due or additional tax due and payment accompanies the amended return; • with regard to income tax returns only, whether the Internal Revenue Service abates federal penalty originally assessed for the same or similar reason as the New Mexico penalty; • with regard to oil and gas tax returns only, whether the taxpayer receives final approval from the appropriate government agency of the taxpayer's participation in production from a state or federal property and pays all oil and gas taxes due on production from the property attributable to the taxpayer no later than the twenty-fifth day of the second month following the month in which the approval is received; and • with regard to an out-of-state business, when a good faith doubt exists as to whether the taxpayer has established nexus with New Mexico and whether the state has jurisdiction over the taxpayer and its transactions into New Mexico for current or prior reporting periods, whether the business volunteers to enter into an agreement to register, report and pay gross receipts tax, corporate income tax or franchise tax or to collect and remit compensating tax as an agent.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Interest Frequency of Interest Rate Determination

Quarterly New Mexico determines interest rates for underpayments and overpayments of tax on a quarterly basis. N.M. Stat. Ann. § 7-1-67(B); N.M. Stat. Ann. § 7-1-68(B);N.M. Taxn. and Rev. Dept., Penalty &Interest Rates. Neither underpayment interest nor overpayment interest is subject to compounding in New Mexico. N.M. Stat. Ann. § 7-1-67(C); N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-68(E). Simple interest is calculated using a daily rate derived from the annual rate. N.M. Stat. Ann. § 7-1-67(B). BNA-SUTN NM 31.13.1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Interest Underpayment Rates Calculation

Federal underpayment rate The interest rate on underpayments of tax in New Mexico is equal to the federal underpayment rate established for individuals under I.R.C. § 6621. Interest accrues from the first day following the day on which the tax is due, without extension, until it is paid. N.M. Stat. Ann. § 7-1-67. Interest accrues on sales and use tax underpayments from the first day following the day on which the tax becomes due, without regard to any time extension or installment agreement, until it is paid. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-67;N.M. Tax'n & Rev. Dept., Penalty and Interest Rates. The imposition of interest is mandatory, not discretionary, and must be imposed regardless of the reason for the underpayment. See New Mexico Public Decision No. 16-48 (Sept. 30, 2016). The following limitations on assessments of interest apply:• if the amount of interest due at the time payment is made is less than $1, then no interest is due; • the tax is paid within 10 days after the date of a demand for payment, no interest will be imposed for the period following the demand; • if a managed audit is completed by the taxpayer on time, and payment of any tax due is paid within 180 days after the Secretary has mailed or delivered an assessment for the tax to the taxpayer, no interest will be due on the assessed tax; or • if a taxpayer is not given proper notice, then the period of 180 days before assessment is exempt from interest.

See New Mexico Bulletin B-400-03. Interest was also not assessed if the liability was paid within 180 days of assessment. See New Mexico Bulletin B-400-03. The Department used the following factors in determining whether a taxpayer was eligible for amnesty: • the Department had not already selected the taxpayer for audit; • amnesty would be applied to existing liabilities; • the taxpayer was not the subject of a criminal investigation; and • the taxpayer was not in the process of bankruptcy. New Mexico Bulletin B-400.03. The amnesty agreement must have included the following components to be considered complete and binding: • bore the signatures of the taxpayer and the secretary; • contained the taxpayer's declaration that all statements in the application and in the agreement were true and correct; • specified the report period covered under the amnesty; • specified the amnesty issues; • specified the procedures and records used in performing the review; • specified the amnesty's beginning date; • specified the date when the taxpayer will present the amnesty results to the Department; and • included the taxpayer's waiver of limitations on assessments for the report period under amnesty, provided that the Department's standard audit procedures required a waiver.

To participate in the MVDP, the taxpayer must:• have a minimum good-faith tax liability estimate of $500 or more; • not have been contacted by a state or commission regarding taxes due;and • submit a completed Voluntary Disclosure Agreement (VDA) including taxpayer's contact information, tax year, list of states to receive the proposed VDA, description of taxpayer's activities in each state, and estimate of taxes due. Multistate Tax Commission, Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program. New Mexico may have additional requirements for participation in the MVDP. The program is intended to incentivize taxpayers to begin filing and paying taxes in all of the states in which they have substantial nexus. Upon entering into a voluntary disclosure agreement with a state, taxpayers will be required to file returns, pay the tax due and accrued interest on the returns, and register with the state in exchange for waiver of penalties for the entire look-back period. Taxpayers are not charged to participate in the MVDP. BNA-SUTN NM 31.15.3.

Additionally, the Department must provide a written notice of outstanding records or books that have been requested, but not received. The notice of outstanding records and books must be given no earlier than 60 days, unless the taxpayer provides a written request for early completion of the audit, and no later than 180 days after the date of the commencement of the audit. The notice must state that if the taxpayer does not properly comply within the 90 days of the date of notice the Department will issue an assessment of the tax due on the basis of information available.

Ann. §7-1-11.1(A). Managed audit means a review and analysis conducted by a taxpayer under an agreement with the Department to determine the taxpayers' compliance with a tax administered pursuant to the Tax Administration Act and the presentation of the results to the Department for assessment of tax found to be due. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-3(J). The taxpayer may by application enter into a written agreement for a managed audit. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-11.1(B). To be effective the written agreement must:• be signed by the taxpayer or the taxpayer's authorized representative and by the secretary; • contain a declaration by the taxpayer or the taxpayer's authorized representative that all statements of fact made by the taxpayer or the taxpayer's representative in the taxpayer's application and the agreement are true and correct as to every material matter; • specify the reporting period or periods, the type of receipts or transactions and tax to be audited, the procedures to be followed in performing the managed audit, the records to be used, the date of the audit, and the date for the taxpayer's presentation of the results of the managed audit to the Department; and • include a waiver by the taxpayer of the limitations on assessments for the reporting period or periods to be audited. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-11.1(B). In determining whether to enter into an agreement for a managed audit, the Secretary may consider the following relevant factors:• the taxpayer's history of tax compliance; • the amount of time and resources the taxpayer has available to dedicate to the audit; • the extent and availability of the taxpayer's records; and • the taxpayer's ability to pay any expected liability. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-11.1(D). The decision whether to enter into an agreement for a managed audit rests solely with the Secretary or the Secretary's delegate. The Department will assess the tax liability found to be due as the result of a managed audit performed in accordance with a managed audit agreement. The Department may review records, documents, schedules, or other information to determine if the managed audit substantially conforms to the managed audit agreement. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-11.1(F).
