Topic: Administration and Procedure Record-Keeping Requirements

3 Years Under Vermont law, every person required to collect the state sales and use tax is required to maintain records of every sale or amusement charge and of all amounts paid, charged, or due on those sales or uses and of the applicable tax payable for a period of three years. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, §9709. The records should contain the information that is necessary to make a determination of the correct sales and use tax liability. Vt. Code R. §1.9709-1(A); Vermont Formal Ruling No. 2012-08 (Nov. 14, 2012). If a taxpayer retains the required records in both electronic and hard-copy formats, the taxpayer must make the records available to the commissioner in the form requested by the commissioner. Vt. Code R. §1.9709-1(C). Time Period for Maintenance of Records Generally, these records are required to be preserved for a period of three years. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, §9709. However, the commissioner may consent in writing to earlier destruction of the records, or may require that the records be kept longer. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, §9709. The time for retention of the records begins to run from the date on which the taxpayer files the tax return. By regulation, the Department of Taxes indicates that it is prudent for taxpayers to retain these required records for a longer period of time, in light of provisions that permit assessment of additional tax beyond the three-year period for certain situations and that the burden of proving exemptions is on the person required to collect the tax. Vt. Code R. §1.9709-4. Content of Records The records required to be kept must include a true copy of each sales slip, invoice, receipt, statement, or memorandum upon which Vermont law requires that a tax be separately stated. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, §9709. More specifically, the taxpayer's records must include, but should not be limited to, the normal books of account ordinarily maintained by the average prudent business person engaged in the taxpayer's business, together with all bills, receipts, invoices, cash register tapes, sales slips, or other documents of original entry supporting the entries in the books of account. The records should also contain all schedules or working papers used in conjunction with the preparation of tax returns. Vt. Code R. §1.9709-1(A). Electronic Records Taxpayers who do not create the electronic equivalent of traditional paper documents in the ordinary course of business are not required to construct electronic records for tax purposes. Taxpayers who do create electronic records in the ordinary course of business are not required to construct electronic records other than those that are created in the ordinary course of business. Vt. Code R. §1.9709-2(C). In the event that a taxpayer uses electronic records to establish tax compliance, those records must contain sufficient transaction-level detail information so that the details underlying the electronic records can be identified and made available to the commissioner upon request. At the time of an examination by the commissioner, the electronic records must be capable of being retrieved and converted to a standard record format. Vt. Code R. §1.9709-2(A)-(B). It should be noted that a taxpayer is not prohibited from demonstrating compliance with tax law using traditional hard-copy documents or reproductions of those documents, whether or not the taxpayer has also retained or has the capacity to retain the records on electronic or other storage media. Vt. Code R. §1.9709-1(D). However, a taxpayer has discretion to discard duplicated records and redundant information, provided that the responsibility to maintain sufficient records for tax compliance purposes is otherwise satisfied. Vt. Code R. §1.9709-2(A). In the event that the commissioner requests that a taxpayer provide a description of the business process that created the taxpayer's records, the taxpayer must provide a description of the relationship between the records and the tax documents prepared by the taxpayer and the measures used to ensure the integrity of the records. More specifically, the taxpayer must be capable of demonstrating the functions being performed as they relate to the flow of data through the system, the internal controls used to ensure the accurate and reliable processing, and internal controls used to prevent unauthorized addition, alteration, or deletion of retained records. Vt. Code R. §1.9709-2(E). The manner in which a taxpayer can satisfy the commissioner's request for access to electronic records depends on the facts and circumstances of a taxpayer's situation. More specifically, a taxpayer may satisfy the request by arranging to provide the commissioner with hardware, software, and personnel resources to access the records;arranging for a third party to provide the hardware, software, and personnel resources necessary to access the records; converting the electronic records to a standard record format that is agreed to and specified by the commissioner; or any other means agreed to by the taxpayer and the commissioner for the provision of access to the records. Vt. Code R. §1.9709-2(F). Alternative Storage Media For purposes of compliance with a taxpayer's record storage and retention requirement, hard-copy documents received or produced in the normal course of business that are required to be retained may be converted to microfilm, microfiche, or other storage-only imaging systems. A taxpayer may discard the original hard-copy documents, provided that the documents retained under the alternative storage media system exhibit a high degree of legibility and readability. Vt. Code R. §1.9709-3(A). Alternative storage media systems may be used to store documents that include, but are not limited to, general books of account, journals, voucher registers, general and subsidiary ledgers, and supporting records of details, such as sales invoices, purchase invoices, exemption certificates, and credit memoranda. Vt. Code R. §1.9709-3(A). In the event that the commissioner requests access to records maintained by an alternative storage media system such as microfilm, microfiche, or other storage-only imaging system, a taxpayer must provide facilities and equipment for reading, locating, and reproducing any documents. Vt. Code R. §1.9709-3(B). BNA-SUTN VT 31.9.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Voluntary Disclosure Relief

Yes The Vermont Department of Taxes has a voluntary disclosure program, which is administered through the Compliance Division. The Department takes a position on voluntary disclosures on a case by case basis determined by the individual fact pattern for each voluntary applicant. Vermont Dept. of Taxes, Voluntary Disclosure Program. As a preliminary matter, in order to be considered for participation in the voluntary disclosure program a disclosure applicant must not have been contacted by the Department prior to initiating the disclosure process. Vermont Dept. of Taxes, Voluntary Disclosure Program. The Department may agree to waive all applicable penalties, provided that the tax and interest due are paid when assessed. Vermont Dept. of Taxes, Voluntary Disclosure Program. If an applicant has been collecting sales taxes from customers and not remitting the tax, the Department will extend the prior period of exposure for liability to include all periods where there are sales and use tax liabilities. However, the specific facts and circumstances for each case will ultimately determine the disposition of penalties that are assessed against a taxpayer. Vermont Dept. of Taxes, Voluntary Disclosure Program. If there is a situation where a taxpayer has questionable liability, such as if it is not entirely clear whether a taxpayer's sales are subject to the sales tax, the Department may agree to prospective filing, or to a limited prior period of exposure for the tax liability. Vermont Dept. of Taxes, Voluntary Disclosure Program. BNA-SUTN VT 31.15.1.

Multistate Tax Commission, Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program. To participate in the MVDP, the taxpayer must:• have a minimum good-faith tax liability estimate of $500 or more; • not have been contacted by a state or commission regarding taxes due;and • submit a completed Voluntary Disclosure Agreement (VDA) including taxpayer's contact information, tax year, list of states to receive the proposed VDA, description of taxpayer's activities in each state, and estimate of taxes due. Multistate Tax Commission, Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program. Vermont may have additional requirements for participation in the MVDP. The program is intended to incentivize taxpayers to begin filing and paying taxes in all of the states in which they have substantial nexus. Upon entering into a voluntary disclosure agreement with a state, taxpayers will be required to file returns, pay the tax due and accrued interest on the returns, and register with the state in exchange for waiver of penalties for the entire look-back period. Taxpayers are not charged to participate in the MVDP. Online Marketplace Seller Voluntary Disclosure Initiative – Special Multistate Tax Commission (MTC) Program From Aug. 17, 2017, through Nov. 1, 2017, Vermont is participating in the MTC's special limited-time voluntary disclosure initiative in which back sales and use tax liability may be waived for eligible online marketplace sellers that timely register and begin to collect the state's sales and use tax.
