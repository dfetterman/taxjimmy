Depends Generally, tangible personal property becomes part of nontaxable real property if it is installed or applied in a fixed or immovable manner. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4; North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Directive SD-15-1 (Mar. 17, 2015). Generally, an item of tangible personal property does not become part of real property if the purpose of attachment is to benefit the tangible personal property rather than the real property to which it is attached.

Depends The installation, repair, or maintenance of freestanding appliances are taxable, but separately stated installation charges given to the real property contractor at the time of the sale are exempt. North Carolina Important Notice: Additional Information Regarding Real Property Contracts and Retail Sales of Repair Maintenance (March 17, 2017). In some states, the sale and installation on real property of complete items of tangible personal property such as kitchen appliances and electronic equipment, sometimes referred to as “fixtures”, is treated as a taxable sale of tangible personal property the same as if these items were sold uninstalled. In this vein, the North Carolina Department of Revenue has clarified that merely plugging a fixture or appliance, such as a refrigerator, into an electrical outlet does not cause the fixture or appliance to become part of real property. North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Directive SD-15-1 (Mar. 17, 2015). A freestanding appliance means a “machine commonly thought of as an appliance operated by gas or electric current. Examples include a dishwasher, washing machine, clothes dryer, refrigerator, freezer, microwave, and range, regardless of whether the range is slide-in or drop-in.” N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.3(11d), as amended by 2017 N.C. S.B. 628, effective June 12, 2018. Effective Jan. 1, 2017, for sales and purchases occurring on or after such date unless the amendment increases a sales or use tax liability, then effective August 11, 2017, North Carolina has since amended its statutes to specify that the sale of a freestanding appliance is a retail sale of tangible personal property. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4(a)(1), as amended by 2017 N.C. S.B. 628, effective retroactively to Jan. 1, 2017, for sales and purchases occurring on or after such date unless an amendment increases a sales or use tax liability, then the change is effective August 11, 2017; North Carolina Sales and Use Form E-505 (09-17).

Nontaxable Amounts that a real property contractor charges to its contractee for capital improvements under a real property contract are not subject to North Carolina's sales and use tax. North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Directive SD-16-3. Real property contractors are treated as the consumer of tangible personal property that they install or apply for others under a real property contract as a capital improvement to real property. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4H(a). Retailers engaged in business in North Carolina must collect tax on the sales price of tangible personal property sold to real property contractors unless an exemption applies. If the retailer does not collect tax at the time of sale, the contractor must pay use tax directly to the state. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4H(a). “Real property contractor”is defined as a person that contracts to perform a real property contract. The term includes a general contractor, a subcontractor, or a builder. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.3(33f), as amended by 2017 N.C. S.B. 628, effective Jan. 1, 2017. “Real property contract”is defined as a contract between a real property contractor and another person to perform a capital improvement to real property. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.3(33e), as amended by 2017 N.C. S.B. 628, effective Jan. 1, 2017; North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Form E-505 (09-17). Effective Jan. 1, 2017, construction work not qualifying as a capital improvement is subject to North Carolina's sales and use tax if it consists of repair, maintenance, or installation services. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.3(33l), as amended by 2015 N.C. H. 1030, effective Jan. 1, 2017; N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4(a)(16), as amended by 2015 N.C. H. 97, effective March 1, 2016. A capital improvement consists of one or more of the following activities:• new construction, reconstruction, or remodeling; • the performance of work that requires the issuance of a permit under the North Carolina Building Code (excluding the repair or replacement of electrical components, gas logs, water heaters, and similar items that are not part of new construction, reconstruction, or remodeling); • the installation of utilities on a utility-owned parcel of land, right-of-way, or easement; • the installation of equipment or a fixture that is attached to real property and meets one or more of the following conditions: ○ the equipment or fixture is capitalized and depreciated under GAAP or IFRS; ○ the equipment or fixture is depreciated under the I.R.C.; or ○ the equipment or fixture is expensed under I.R.C. §179; • the painting or wallpapering of real property, except where the painting or wallpapering is incidental to the repair, maintenance, or installation service; • the replacement or installation of a septic tank system, siding, roof, plumbing, electrical, commercial refrigeration, irrigation, sprinkler, or other similar system (excluding the repair, replacement, or installation of electrical or plumbing components, water heaters, gutters, and similar individual items that are not part of new construction, reconstruction, or remodeling); • the replacement or installation of a heating or air conditioning unit or a heating, ventilation, or air conditioning system (excluding the repair, replacement, or installation of gas logs, water heaters, pool heaters and similar individual items that are not part of new construction, reconstruction, or remodeling); • the replacement or installation of roads, driveways, parking lots, patios, decks, and sidewalks; • the performance of services to resolve an issue that was part of a real property contract if the services are performed within six months of the completion of the real property contract, or, for new construction, within 12 months of the new structure being occupied for the first time; • landscaping;and • an addition or alteration to real property that is permanently affixed or installed to real property and is not an activity listed as a repair, maintenance, or installation service under N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.3(33l). N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.3(2c), as added by 2017 N.C.

North Carolina Important Notice: Additional Information Regarding Real Property Contracts and Retail Sales of Repair Maintenance. If property purchased becomes a part of a building or structure in North Carolina and the purchaser is a contractor or its subcontractor, the contractor, the subcontractor, and the owner of the building or structure are jointly and severally liable for the tax. The liability of the retailer-contractor, subcontractor, or owner who did not purchase the property is satisfied by receipt of an affidavit from the purchaser certifying that the tax has been paid. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4H(b1); North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Bulletin Section 31North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Directive SD-15-1 (March 17, 2015). An invoice or other documentation issued to a consumer at the time of the sale by a real property contractor must not separately state any amount for tax. Any amount for tax separately stated on an invoice or other documentation given to a consumer by a real property contractor is an erroneous collection and must be remitted to the Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Revenue. If the secretary determines that a real property contractor erroneously collected sales tax on a transaction as if it were a retail sale and is liable for use tax on a related transaction, the Secretary may allow the real property contractor to offset the use tax liability with the sales tax erroneously collected. Otherwise, the real property contractor is liable for both the sales tax erroneously collected on the transaction and any sales or use tax due on the purchase price of the tangible personal property used to fulfill a real property contract. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4H(c); N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.11; North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Directive SD-15-1 revised (October 25, 2016); North Carolina Important Notice: Erroneous Collection of Sales Tax on a Real Property Contract. Documenting Capital Improvement Form E-589CI, Affidavit of Capital Improvement, is generally required to substantiate that a contract, or a portion of work to be performed to fulfill a contract, is to be taxed for sales and use tax purposes as a real property contract with respect to a capital improvement to real property. Failure of a person to issue Form E-589CI, other than for the permitted exceptions, to substantiate that a transaction is for a real property contract with respect to a capital improvement subjects the transaction to tax as a retail sale of repair, maintenance, and installation services for real property. North Carolina Important Notice: Updated Form E-589CI, Affidavit of Capital Improvement. A person that issues Form E-589CI in error is liable for use tax on the sales price of or the gross receipts derived from the transaction if it is determined that the contract is not a real property contract with respect to a capital improvement to real property. North Carolina Important Notice: Updated Form E-589CI, Affidavit of Capital Improvement. “Single Use” of Form E-589CI(Section I) A person must complete “Section I —Single Use” of Form E-589CI for a one-time use to ensure that a transaction that otherwise meets the definition of repair, maintenance, or installation services to real property is taxed for sales and use tax purposes as a real property contract with respect to a capital improvement for real property. North Carolina Important Notice: Updated Form E-589CI, Affidavit of Capital Improvement. The single use section will generally apply for the following: 1. When a homeowner remodels and oversees the entire activity, including: obtaining bids, selection of subcontractors, and payment of all invoices or billings issued by any real property contractor. The homeowner must complete Section I of Form E-589CI and issue the form to each subcontractor to give notice that the transaction is for a real property contract with respect to a capital improvement. North Carolina Important Notice: Updated Form E-589CI, Affidavit of Capital Improvement. 2. When a real property contractor hires a subcontractor to perform a portion of the overall real property contract and there is not a recurring business relationship between the two parties. For purposes of Form E-589CI, a recurring business relationship exists when a period of no more than 12 months elapses between transactions between two parties. North Carolina Important Notice: Updated Form E-589CI, Affidavit of Capital Improvement. 3. When a real property contractor hires another subcontractor for the performance of work that requires the issuance of a permit under the State Building Code, other than new construction or reconstruction. Form E-589CI should not be issued for the repair or replacement of electrical components, gas logs, water heaters, and similar individual items no matter that a permit is required where such are not part of new construction, reconstruction, or remodeling and are subject to tax as repair, maintenance, and installation services. North Carolina Important Notice: Updated Form E-589CI, Affidavit of Capital Improvement. 4. When a business entity hires another person to perform part, or all, of the installation of equipment or a fixture that is attached to real property so that removal of the item would cause physical, functional, or economic damage to the property and the item is capitalized under one or more of the following: the Internal Revenue Code, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or International Financial Reporting Standards. North Carolina Important Notice: Updated Form E-589CI, Affidavit of Capital Improvement. “Blanket Use” of Form E-589CI(Section II) A general contractor may complete “Section II — Blanket Use” of Form E-589CI and issue the form to a subcontractor who is used exclusively to perform part, or all, of real property contracts with respect to capital improvements to real property. A blanket use affidavit continues in force, so long as the general contractor named in “Box C” and the subcontractor named in “Box D” maintain a recurring business relationship(when a period of no more than 12 months elapse between transactions between the two parties) or until withdrawn or otherwise notified by the issuer of the form. This will generally apply for the following:• a builder who hires the same real property contractor only for new construction; • a real property contractor who hires the same subcontractor only for reconstruction; • a real property contractor who hires the same subcontractor for remodeling if the activities performed by the subcontractor are never repair, maintenance, and installation services for real property; and • a real property contractor who exclusively hires the same subcontractor to perform part, or all, of its real property contracts with respect to capital improvements for real property.

Beginning on March 1, 2016, and prior to Jan. 1, 2017, only sellers primarily deriving revenue from retailing tangible personal property, digital property, or services to consumers or properly classified in NAICS sector 44-45 were subject to sales and use tax on their sales of repair, maintenance, and installation services performed on real property. North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Directive SD-16-1. Effective Jan. 1, 2017, a seller's NAICS classification or the business from which it derives a majority of its revenue is no longer relevant in determining whether repair, maintenance, and installation services it performs on real property are taxable, and those services qualifying as capital improvements are nontaxable regardless of by whom performed. North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Directive SD-16-3. A service provider may purchase tangible personal property that he will transfer in the performance of taxable repair, maintenance, or installation upon real property tax-free under North Carolina's resale exemption. North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Directive SD-16-4. Where a contractor purchases parts, supplies, or other tangible personal property or digital property, and the contractor pays sales or use tax on the property prior to Jan. 1, 2017, no credit is allowed for that tax paid when such items are transferred to a purchaser as part of a taxable repair, maintenance, or installation to real property on or after Jan. 1, 2017.

North Carolina Important Notice: Transition Issues Relative to Sales and Use Tax Law Changes with Respect to Real Property Contracts; Repair, Maintenance, and Installation Services to Real Property, and other Items. A person who is considered a real property contractor prior to Jan. 1, 2017, may become a retailer-contractor or retailer effective Jan. 1, 2017. If the retailer-contractor or retailer makes retail sales of taxable repair, maintenance, and installation services to real property on or after Jan. 1, 2017, the retailer-contractor or retailer may purchase tangible personal property without payment of sales or use tax prior to Jan. 1, 2017, provided at the time of purchase it is known that such items will be part of the sales price of repair, maintenance, and installation services sold at retail on or after Jan. 1, 2017. North Carolina Important Notice: Transition Issues Relative to Sales and Use Tax Law Changes with Respect to Real Property Contracts; Repair, Maintenance, and Installation Services to Real Property, and other Items. Mixed Transaction Contracts A “mixed transaction contract” is defined as a contract that includes both a real property contract for a capital improvement and a repair, maintenance, and installation service for real property that is not related to the capital improvement. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.3(20b), as amended by 2017 N.C. S. 628, enacted Aug. 11, 2017, effective retroactively to Jan. 1, 2017, and 2018 N.C. S. 99, enacted July 1, 2018, effective retroactively to Jan. 1, 2017. The tax treatment depends on the percentage of the contract that is attributable to taxable repair, maintenance, and installation services relative to nontaxable capital improvement. If the allocated sales price of the taxable repair, maintenance, and installation service is less than or equal to 25 percent of the contract price, then the repair, maintenance, and installation services portion of the contract is treated as a real property contract. However, if the allocated sales price of the taxable repair, maintenance, and installation services included in the contract is greater than 25 percent of the contract price, then tax applies to the sales price of or the gross receipts derived from the taxable repair, maintenance, and installation services portion of the contract. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4H(d), as amended by 2017 N.C. S. 628, enacted Aug. 11, 2017, effective retroactively to Jan. 1, 2017; North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Form E-505 (09-17). Prior to Jan. 1, 2017, the measure used to make this determination was 10 percent. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4H(d) (2016). Construction Materials Assembled Out-of-State The North Carolina Court of Appeals in Morton Buildings Inc. v. Tolson, held that construction materials purchased and stored and assembled into building components outside North Carolina were tangible personal property subject to use tax in North Carolina when the resulting building components were brought into the state. The taxpayer was a construction contractor that produces, sells and erects prefabricated warehouses and other buildings. The taxpayer sought a refund of the North Carolina use tax paid on the building materials purchased out of state that it used to build trusses, columns, purlins, and metal panels at one of its out-of-state locations. The taxpayer argued that the materials were consumed and transformed into building components outside North Carolina, and that these building components became part of a building or other structure in the state, not the building materials. The court held that use tax applies to the building materials because the statute provides no limitation that tangible personal property must be in the form in which it was purchased to be subject to the state's use tax.
