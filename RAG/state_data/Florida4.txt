Taxable Motor vehicles are generally subject to Florida sales and use tax, but exemptions or partial exemptions may apply. Fla. Stat. §212.02(19); Fla. Stat. §320.01; Florida Tax Brochure GT-800030. Tax is due on the full sales price before any deductions are made for any accessory; preparation, settlement, or closing fees; freight, handling, or delivery of the motor vehicle to the dealer; commission, and any other expense or cost of the dealer that the dealer requires the purchaser to pay. Any separately itemized fee or charge mandated by a state law for titling, licensing, or registering the motor vehicle, or for recording a lien is not subject to tax. Florida Tax Brochure GT-800030 (explaining dealer requirements for selling or leasing motor vehicles). Florida defines “motor vehicles”as automobiles, motorcycles, trucks, trailers, semitrailers, truck tractor and semitrailer combinations, or any other vehicles operated on the roads of this state, used to transport persons or property, and propelled by power other than muscular power.

The credit may not exceed the lesser of $105 or the amount of sales tax that would otherwise be collected from the purchaser of a motor vehicle by a dealer, designated agent, or private tag agent. This credit does not apply to the lease or rental of a motor vehicle. Fla. Stat. §212.1832(1), as added by 2018 Fla. H.B. 7055, effective March 11, 2018; Fla. Admin.

Stat. §1002.395(16) (application requirements for eligible organizations). Trade-ins A trade-in that the dealer intends to resell lowers the sales price if the sale and trade occur in one transaction. A dealer's discount reduces the selling price of the vehicle at the moment of sale. Manufacturer rebates are not considered a reduction in the sales price. Tax must be calculated on the taxable sales price before the rebate. Florida Tax Brochure GT-800030 (explaining dealer requirements for selling or leasing motor vehicles). Motor Vehicles Sold in Florida to Nonresidents Florida allows a partial exemption for a motor vehicle purchased in Florida by a resident of another state. In this case, the tax imposed is the lesser of: (1)the amount of sales tax that would be imposed by the purchaser's state of residence or (2) the amount otherwise payable on motor vehicles purchased by residents of Florida. Fla. Stat. §212.08(10); Florida Tax Information Publication 19A01-01 (Jan. 11, 2019); Florida Tax Information Publication 18A01-01R2 (July 25, 2018); Florida Tax Information Publication 18A01-01R (Feb. 28, 2018); Florida Tax Information Bulletin 16A01-01R2 (March 22, 2016); Florida Tax Brochure 15A01-01R2. To be eligible for the lower tax rate, the buyer must give the dealer a completed, notarized Affidavit for Partial Exemption of Motor Vehicle Sold for Licensing in Another State (Form DR-123). Florida Tax Information Publication 18A01-01R (Feb. 28, 2018); Florida Tax Information Bulletin 16A01-01 (Jan. 29, 2016); Florida Tax Brochure GT-800030.

Stat. §212.08(10); Florida Tax Information Publication 18A01-01R (Feb. 28, 2018). The dealer must keep the affidavit for three years. Florida Tax Brochure GT-800030. For current rates, see Florida Tax Information Publication 18A01-01R (Feb. 28, 2018). All tax collected must be paid to the Florida Department of Revenue. If a vehicle is bought by a nonresident corporation or partnership, Florida sales tax is due if any officer of the corporation, or any stockholder or partner who owns at least 10 percent of the corporation or partnership, is a Florida resident. However, if the vehicle is removed from Florida within 45 days after purchase and remains out of the state for a minimum of 180 days, the purchasing entity may qualify to pay its home state tax rate, despite the residency of its owners, stockholders, or partners. Fla. Stat. §212.08(10); Florida Tax Information Publication 19A01-01 (Jan. 11, 2019); Florida Tax Information Publication 18A01-01R2 (July 25, 2018); Florida Tax Information Publication 18A01-01R (Feb. 28, 2018); Florida Tax Information Publication 16A01-24R (March 27, 2017); Florida Tax Brochure GT-800030 (explaining dealer requirements for selling or leasing motor vehicles) (Oct. 2014); Florida Tax Information Bulletin 13A01-02R (May 20, 2013). Motor Vehicles Purchased Out-of-State by Florida Residents Use tax applies to vehicles purchased in another state and brought into and licensed in Florida. Florida gives credit on motor vehicles brought into Florida where a like tax has been imposed and paid in another state. If the like tax amount is equal to or greater than the amount imposed by Florida, no additional tax is due. If the amount is less than the amount imposed by Florida, only the difference between the two is due. Florida Tax Information Publication 19A01-01 (Jan. 11, 2019); Florida Tax Information Publication 18A01-01R (Feb. 28, 2018); Florida Tax Brochure 15A01-01R2. Any motor vehicle used in another state, District of Columbia, or U.S. territory for six months or longer before being brought into Florida is presumed to be purchased for use outside Florida. When the vehicle owner provides documentation establishing that the vehicle was used outside Florida for six months or longer before being registered in Florida, no Florida use tax is due. Florida Tax Information Publication 18A01-01R (Feb. 28, 2018); Florida Tax Information Publication 16A01-24R2 (revised July 7, 2017). Motor Vehicles Purchased Out of the Country by an Active Member of the United States Armed Forces and His or Her Spouse A motor vehicle imported from a foreign country by an active member of the U.S. Armed Forces, or his or her spouse, is exempt from taxation when both of these conditions are met:• the vehicle was purchased and used in a foreign country for six months or longer before being imported in Florida; • the vehicle is registered or titled in Florida for personal use by the active member or his or her spouse; and • at the time of registration or titling of the motor vehicle, proof is provided of the member's active status in the armed forces, and if the vehicle is being registered by or to include the name of a spouse, verification of the spouse's relationship to the active member. Fla. Stat. §212.08(7)(nnn);Florida Defense Support Task Force, 2018 Florida Military-Friendly Guide; Florida Tax Information Publication 15A01-14 (June 26, 2015). Discretionary Sales Surtax Most counties also have a local discretionary sales surtax, which applies to the first $5,000 of the total sales price or each lease payment. Discretionary sales surtax is due on the purchase or lease of a motor vehicle when the home address of the buyer (as shown on the registration) is in a Florida county that has a surtax. Florida Tax Brochure GT-800030 (explaining dealer requirements for selling or leasing motor vehicles). Motor Vehicles Purchased by Veterans When a veteran purchases a motor vehicle from a dealer pursuant to the provisions of 38 U.S.C. §3902(a), or any successor provision, the amount that is paid by the Veterans Administration directly to the dealer on behalf of the veteran is not taxable. However, any portion of the purchase price paid directly to the dealer by the veteran is taxable. Fla. Stat. §212.08(7)(nn); see also Florida Tax Brochure GT-800030. Title Transfers Motor vehicle title transfers when a business name has changed from “Inc.” to “LLC” are exempt from sales tax, provided that a Sales Tax Exemption Affidavit (DR-40) with the language “Conversion of a corporation to an LLC that qualifies as a reorganization solely in exchange for stock under I.R.C. s. 368(a)(1)(F)” signed under penalty of perjury accompanies the applications for title transfer. Florida Technical Assistance Advisement 16A-018 (Dec. 2, 2016). Motor Vehicles Leases When a motor vehicle is leased or rented in Florida for a period of less than 12 months, the entire amount of such rental is taxable, even if the vehicle is dropped off in another state. Fla. Stat. §212.05(1)(c)1.a; Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.007(13)(c). However, if the motor vehicle is rented in another state and dropped off in Florida, the rental is exempt from Florida tax. Fla. Stat. §212.05(1)(c)1.b. Tax does not apply to the lease or rental of a commercial motor vehicle as defined in Fla. Stat. §316.003(66) (Commercial Motor Vehicle) to one lessee or renter for a period of not less than 12 months if tax was paid on the purchase price of such vehicle by the lessor. Tax paid in another jurisdiction can be credited against the tax due in Florida, up to the amount of tax owed in Florida. If the tax paid to the other jurisdiction is less than that owed in Florida, the difference should be remitted to the Florida Department of Revenue. This treatment is only available when the lease or rental of such property is an established business or part of an established business or the same is incidental or germane to such business. Fla. Stat. §212.05(1)(c)3. Rental Surcharge A surcharge of $2 per day or any part of a day is imposed upon the lease or rental of a motor vehicle licensed for hire and designed to carry less than nine passengers regardless of whether such motor vehicle is licensed in Florida. The surcharge applies to only the first 30 days of the term of any lease or rental. The surcharge is subject to all applicable taxes imposed by chapter 212(Tax on Sales, Use, and Other Transactions). Fla. Stat. §212.0606(1). Motor vehicle leases are generally subject to tax, and in the case of motor vehicles (or trailers), notwithstanding any other provision of law, a transaction does not create a security interest merely because it provides that the rental price is permitted or required to be adjusted under the agreement either upward or downward by reference to the amount realized upon sale or other disposition of the motor vehicle or trailer (i.e., a terminal rental adjustment clause.) Fla. Stat. §319.271. County Surtax Passenger car rentals are subject to the state of Florida's sales and use tax because the state tax applies to rentals of tangible personal property, which is defined to include motor vehicles. Fla. Stat. §212.02(19); Fla. Stat. §212.05(1)(c). The county surtax applies to the same base as the state sales and use tax. Fla. Stat. §212.054(2)(a). Therefore, passenger car rentals are subject to the local sales and use tax. However, Florida law does not authorize the imposition of any other local option transaction taxes on passenger car rentals. Temporary Presence in State Florida statutes and regulations do not address temporary presence of motor vehicles in the state. Fla. Stat. §212.01 et seq.; Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.001 et seq.
