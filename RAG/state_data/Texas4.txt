Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Aircraft, Intrastate or Non-Commercial Use Purchase, Lease, or Rental Transactions

Depends In general, Texas imposes sales and use tax on purchases of aircraft as purchases of tangible personal property. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.051; Texas Tax Publication 94-168. However, Texas offers five statutory exemptions from the general rule. See Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.328(a); see also Texas Tax Publication 94-168. Namely, Texas exempts an aircraft purchase if the purchaser is:• a licensed and certificated carrier who uses the aircraft to transport persons or property in the regular course of its business; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.328(a)(1); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.297(d)(1); Texas Tax Publication 94-168; see also Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.297(a)(1) (defining the phrase “licensed and certificated carrier”). • an FAA-recognized flight instructor who uses the aircraft in a program designed to lead to pilot certification; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.328(a)(2); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.297(c)(7); Texas Tax Publication 94-168; see also Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.297(c)(8) (offering a similar exemption to students enrolled in FAA-approved programs who rent aircraft for flight training, including solo flights and other flights, under an instructor's direction); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 108,574 (March 28, 2017)(the use of an aircraft for flight instruction does not need to be exclusive in order for the exemption to apply, but sales and use tax will apply to the divergent use). • a foreign government; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.328(a)(3); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.297(c)(2); Texas Tax Publication 94-168. • a person who uses and registers the aircraft in another state or nation before using it in Texas; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.328(a)(4); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.297(c)(9); Texas Tax Publication 94-168. The regulation explains that in-Texas flight training in the aircraft does not constitute in-Texas use for the purposes of this exemption. or • a person who uses the aircraft for exclusively agricultural purposes(e.g., wildlife and livestock surveillance or crop dusting). Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.328(a)(5); Texas Tax Publication 94-168. Texas defines the term “aircraft”to include most fixed-wing aircraft, Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.328(c)(1); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.297(c)(1). More specifically, the statute and regulation both reference “a fixed-wing, heavier-than-air craft that is driven by propeller or jet and is supported by the dynamic reaction of the air against its wings.” a helicopter, Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.328(c)(2); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.297(c)(2). and an FAA-approved airplane flight simulator for use in Phase II or higher. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.328(c)(3); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.297(c)(3). However, the term “aircraft”does not include rockets or missiles. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.328(c); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.297(c). Administrative Rules Regarding Use Tax on Hangared Aircraft In addition to the five statutory exemptions, the Comptroller has a rule to determine whether a taxpayer owes use tax on an aircraft. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.297(c)(3); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.297(c)(4). An aircraft is not subject to use tax if it is hangared outside Texas and is used more than 50 percent outside Texas. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.297(c)(3). The regulation explains that the Comptroller considers all flight time in Texas, including the portion of interstate flights in Texas airspace. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.297(c)(3)(A). See Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 110,794 (March 21, 2017)(upholding use tax assessment on purchase price of aircraft hangared in Texas for the relevant period and for which flight records showed a significant number of Texas flights). The rule also explains that to qualify as an exempt hangared aircraft, the aircraft's owners or operators must maintain sufficient records to show the percentage of time the aircraft was used in Texas, Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.297(c)(3). and that the comptroller may examine the aircraft's flight, engine, passenger, airframe, and other logs and records as necessary. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.297(c)(3)(B). An aircraft purchased outside Texas is subject to Texas use tax if it is hangared in Texas and is not otherwise exempt. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.297(c)(4); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 109,036 (Nov. 9, 2017); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 110,794 (March 21, 2017). The rule provides three factors to consider in determining where the aircraft is hangared, namely where the aircraft is rendered for ad valorem taxes; Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.297(c)(4)(A). whether the owner owns or leases hangar space in Texas; Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.297(c)(4)(B). and whether the owner or operator has declared the aircraft's place of storage to the FAA, an insurer, or another taxing authority. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.297(c)(4)(C). Occasional Sales of Aircraft The sale of an aircraft, like other tangible personal property, can be purchased tax free if transferred during an occasional sale, so long as the buyer and purchaser can prove that the transaction qualifies for the occasional sale exemption. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 109,237 (Jul. 12, 2016). See Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,043 (April 5, 2017)(purchaser of aircraft not entitled to occasional sale exemption because seller, a Qualified Intermediary in this I.R.C. § 1031 reverse exchange transaction, acted as a broker and acquired the aircraft for the purpose of reselling it); see also Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,574 (Jan. 12, 2018) (affirming use tax assessment against taxpayer, despite good faith reliance on Statements of Occasional Sale; the sale of the aircraft did not meet the requirements of an occasional exempt sale and no safe harbor exists for Statements of Occasional Sale). A taxpayer may claim the occasional sale exemption only if all the following requirements are met: (1) the seller did not “habitually engage, or hold himself out as engaging, in the business of selling taxable items at retail”; (2) the seller makes two or fewer sales of taxable items during the 12-month period in which the sale occurred; (3) the seller does not hold a sales tax permit; and (4) the purchaser does not hold a sales tax permit. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.304(b); see also Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 109,036 (Nov. 9, 2017) (sales by permitted sellers are excluded from the occasional sale exemption). Occasional sales include the sale of the entire operating assets of a business, or a separate division or identifiable segment of a business. Operating assets mean tangible personal property used exclusively by the business in providing a product or service. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.304(b)(2); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.316(d); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,861 (Sept. 14, 2017). Fractional Ownership Programs Texas does not impose sales and use tax on an aircraft interest purchased via a fractional aircraft program (i.e., a program in which the sponsor/seller places several aircraft in a lease exchange pool under the control of a management company). Instead, that interest is considered a non-taxable transportation service because the management company provides all flight crews, maintenance and administrative services required to operate the aircraft. The sponsor cannot purchase aircraft used in the program tax-free for resale. Texas Tax Publication 94-168. Sale for Resale Sales of aircraft are exempt from use tax if the purchaser, who is in the business of selling, leasing, or renting taxable items, acquired the aircraft for the sole purpose of selling, leasing, or renting it in the regular course of business. See Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.006, as amended by 2019 Tex. S.B. 1525, effective June 10, 2019; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.104(b); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 109,036 (Nov. 9, 2017); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 109,074 (June 16, 2016); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 108,663 (Apr. 22, 2016); see also Cantu Enters., LLC v. Hegar, No. 03-15-00516-CV, 2017 BL 234092 (Tex. App. July 7, 2017) (affirming trial court's denial of sale for resale exemption and its finding that aircraft purchase was for business and personal purposes and thus, was not solely for purpose of leasing aircraft). If the purchaser sells, leases, or rents the aircraft by an occasional sale, the purchaser owes tax on the amount by which the purchase price exceeds the amount of rent, it any, on which tax has been collected. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.316(g)(1); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,861 (Sept. 14, 2017). A sale for resale includes the sale of an aircraft to a purchaser acquiring the aircraft for the purpose of leasing, renting, or reselling it to another person in the U.S., or its territories, or in Mexico. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §163.002(a). Leasing or renting aircraft includes the transfer by the lessor of operational control of the aircraft to one or more lessees pursuant to a written agreement for consideration, regardless of the form of the consideration. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §163.002(b); Texas Tax Policy News June 2018. The lessor's purchase of an aircraft remains an exempt sale for resale, even if the lessor uses the aircraft, provided that for a one-year period beginning on the purchase date, more than 50 percent of the aircraft's departures are made under the operational control of one or more lessees pursuant to a written agreement. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §163.002(c); Texas Tax Policy News June 2018; see Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201812005L (Dec. 21, 2018); Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201801016L (Jan. 12, 2018). The prohibition set forth in Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.154(a) against a purchaser's use of an item for which a resale certificate is provided does not apply to a purchaser of an aircraft. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §163.002(d); Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201702028L (Feb. 23, 2017). After meeting the requirements during the first year of ownership, there are no statutory restrictions on the use of the aircraft. Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201804013L (April 20, 2018). The storage, display, and demonstration of the aircraft pending its lease or sale is not subject to use tax because such uses are incidental to holding the aircraft for resale; a seller who uses the aircraft for purposes unrelated to the resale of the aircraft may not claim the exemption. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 109,680 (March 6, 2018); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 107,713 (Feb. 2, 2018) (denying exemption where the taxpayer could not establish that its use of aircraft was related to holding the aircraft for resale). Depreciating the aircraft on federal income tax returns is partial but strong evidence that the aircraft is being used. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 115,331 (Jan. 14, 2019). The Texas Comptroller's administrative rule defines a “lease” or “rental” as a “transaction, by whatever name called, in which possession but not title to tangible personal property is transferred for a consideration.” Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.294(a)(2); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 109,074 (June 16, 2016). The purchase of an aircraft qualifies as a sale for resale even if it was purchased with the intent of selling or leasing it to a related party, provided the transaction would qualify if the initial purchase was made with the intent of selling or leasing the aircraft to an unrelated party. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §163.006(a); see Texas Comptroller's Letters No. 201801016L and 201801014L (Jan. 12, 2018). In order for a lessor of aircraft to be entitled to the sale for resale tax exemption, the lessor must give up exclusive possession and control was not transferred to the lessee. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 109,074 (June 16, 2016). If the lessor retains a significant degree of control, the Agreement falls short of qualifying as a lease for sales tax purposes. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 109,074 (June 16, 2016). Additionally, purchasers of aircraft must have proper documentation of the aircraft's use to ensure that it was purchased for resale. An aircraft purchaser will have to pay sales and use tax on aircraft where an aircraft is purchased with a sale for resale certificate yet there is no indication of a sale or lease. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 108,663 (Apr. 22, 2016). Aircraft Service Contracts v. Leases It is the transfer of absolute control and possession of property at an agreed price which differentiates a lease from a service agreement. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,714 (Apr. 25, 2016). The essential prerequisite of a lease is the exclusive possession of the property by a person other than the owner for a specified period of time. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,714 (Apr. 25, 2016). When the owner of an aircraft retains or reserves control over the aircraft during the term of an agreement (e.g., a service contract) with a carrier, there is no transfer of exclusive possession and control and the transaction is not a lease. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,714 (Apr. 25, 2016). Temporary Presence in State Effective Sept. 1, 2015, Texas does not impose use tax on aircraft brought into Texas solely to be completed, repaired, remodeled, or restored. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §163.003, as added by 2015 Tex. S.B. 1396, effective Sept. 1, 2015. See Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,488 (Oct. 27, 2016) (taxpayer failed to prove his claim that aircraft purchased and repaired in Texas was purchased solely for export to Mexico). Sales of Aircraft Outside State Texas presumes that an aircraft purchased outside Texas and brought into the within a year was purchased for use in Texas, and thus is subject to use tax. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.101(a) (imposing use tax on in-state storage or use); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.104(a) (presuming that tangible personal property shipped or brought into Texas is used or stored within Texas); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.105(a) (presuming that the sale of a taxable item for delivery in Texas is used or stored within Texas); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.009 (defining the phrase “tangible personal property”). In addition, an aircraft purchased then transferred to an affiliated entity outside the state for little to no consideration, and brought into Texas within one year of the purchase is presumed to have been purchased for use in Texas. Consequently, unless otherwise exempt, the aircraft is subject to state and local use tax in Texas. See Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 200908387L (Aug. 6, 2009) (use tax may be owed by individual who purchases aircraft outside Texas then essentially donates the aircraft to his wholly-owned subsidiary before aircraft enters Texas). However, an aircraft bought, leased, or rented outside of Texas is not subject to Texas sales and use tax if it is predominantly used outside the state for at least one year. The one-year period begins on the date the aircraft is acquired out of state or the date the construction of the aircraft was completed, whichever is later. The aircraft must be substantially complete in the condition for its intended use for the one-year period to begin. An aircraft is “predominantly” used outside of Texas if more than 50 percent of the departures are made from locations outside Texas. Taxpayers must keep records showing each of the aircraft's departures in order to qualify for this exemption. Texas Tax Publication 94-168. Moreover, the sale of an aircraft, or other tangible personal property, may be subject to scrutiny under the “economic substance doctrine” if there is no business purpose to a transaction or a series of closely related transactions. Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 200908387L (Aug. 6, 2009). An economic substance determination involves consideration of several factors:• Did the purchase and sale of the aircraft have a substantial economic effect on seller, that is, did he make a profit? • Was the sale to the buyer arranged before the sale by a broker to the seller? • Was the seller merely a conduit to create a technical compliance with the occasional sale requirements? • Did the seller incur economic risk? • Did the seller have a business purpose or a personal reason for acquiring the aircraft? • Did the seller use the aircraft? • Was the seller related to either the broker or the buyer? Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 200908387L (Aug. 6, 2009). BNA-SUTN TX 29.1.1.

Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.328(d); Texas Tax Publication 94-168. See Texas Comptroller's Decision Hearing Nos. 44,896, 47,235 (Oct. 19, 2009) (parts bags, gas masks, nitrile gloves and earplugs used in the repair and maintenance of aircrafts are exempt from sales and use tax). Aircraft Fixtures and Component Parts Texas also exempts purchases of tangible personal property that becomes permanently affixed to an aircraft, is attached as a component part to the aircraft, or is necessary for the aircraft's normal operations and is pumped, poured, or otherwise placed in the aircraft owned or operated by a licensed and certificated carrier or a licensed flight instructor. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.328(e). But see Texas Comptroller's Decision Hearing Nos. 44,896, 47,235 (Oct. 19, 2009)(tissue paper, towels and seat covers used on aircraft are subject to sales and use tax). Property covered under this exemption includes air cargo containers that are secured or attached to the aircraft while in flight, radar equipment or other electronic devices used for navigational or communications purposes, food carts, smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, seats, battery chargers and diagnostic equipment. However, the exemption does not cover machinery, tools, and equipment that support the overall aviation operation, such as baggage loading and handling, garbage and other waste disposal and booking reservations. Texas Tax Publication 94-168. Repair of Jet Turbine Engines Texas does not impose sales and use tax on purchases of machinery, equipment, or replacement parts and accessories with a useful life greater than six months that are used to overhaul or repair jet turbine aircraft engines for a licensed or certificated carrier of persons or property. The exemption covers aluminum oxide, nitric acid and sodium cyanide used in electrochemical plating, as well as electricity or natural gas used in the off-wing processing, overhaul or repair of a jet turbine engine or its parts for a licensed or certificated carrier.

Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Motor Vehicles, Intrastate or Non-Commercial Use Purchase, Lease, or Rental Transactions

Exempt Motor vehicles are exempt from sales and use tax in Texas as items taxed under another law. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.308(a)(4). Motor vehicles are subject to the motor vehicle tax in lieu of the sales and use tax. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §152.021(a). A motor vehicle is defined to mean a self-propelled vehicle designed to transport persons or property on a public highway;a trailer and semitrailer (including a van, flatbed, tank, dumpster, dolly, jeep, stinger, auxiliary axle, or converter gear; or a house trailer. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §152.001(3). For more information on the tax on motor vehicles, see the Excise Tax Navigator, at Texas 9.2. Unrepaired Salvage Vehicles Texas does not consider unrepaired salvage vehicles to be motor vehicles. Accordingly, sales of unrepaired salvage vehicles are subject to the sales and use tax instead of the motor vehicle sales tax. Texas Tax Policy News March 2019. An unrepaired salvage vehicle is a vehicle that:• has a salvage vehicle title; • has a certificate of authority for an abandoned motor vehicle; or • has been declared a total loss by an insurance company as part of a settlement or adjustment of a claim. Texas Tax Policy News March 2019. Unless a transaction qualifies as an occasional sale, the person who purchases an unrepaired salvage vehicle is responsible for paying sales tax to the Texas seller, if the seller is a dealer or an individual who holds a Texas sales and use tax permit. If a purchaser buys an unrepaired salvage vehicle from a Texas seller who is a dealer or an individual who holds a permit, and the seller does not collect sales tax, or a purchaser buy an unrepaired salvage vehicle outside Texas for use in the state, the purchaser must pay use tax directly to the Texas Comptroller's office. Texas Tax Policy News March 2019. Sales of rebuilt and repaired salvage vehicles are subject to the motor vehicle sales tax. Texas Tax Policy News March 2019. Off-Highway Vehicles Vehicles not designed to transport persons or property on a public highway are not subject to the motor vehicle tax and are instead subject to the sales and use tax. See Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.308(a)(4); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §152.001(3). Manufacturers of off-highway vehicles holding a manufacturer's license must report each warranty issued for a new off-highway vehicle that is sold to a Texas resident by a retailer outside the state. This allows the comptroller to investigate whether use tax on the vehicle has been paid. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §§151.481, 151.482, both added by 2019 Tex. H.B. 1543, effective Sept. 1, 2019. Assessor/collectors may not issue a title for an off-highway vehicle purchased from an out-of-state retailer unless the applicant demonstrates that they have either paid the use tax or are exempt. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0301(b), as added by 2019 Tex. H.B. 1543, effective Sept. 1, 2019. BNA-SUTN TX 29.3.1.

Lump-Sum Charges for Parts A motor vehicle repair shop that charges a single price for parts and labor should not collect sales tax from the customer, but instead should pay sales tax to its supplier when buying parts. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.060(b); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.290(g); Texas Tax Publication 94-113; Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,523 (Aug. 30, 2018). Texas defines the term “lump-sum contract”as a written agreement in which the agreed price for doing a job is one lump-sum amount and in which the charges for materials are not separate from the charges for skill and labor. Separated invoices issued to the customer do not change a written lump-sum contract into a separated contract unless the contract's terms require separated invoices. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.290(a)(8); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,302 (Jan. 24, 2018). Separately Stated Charges for Parts A shop that charges separately for labor and parts must collect sales tax on the parts. In this situation, the shop can issue a resale certificate in lieu of paying tax when buying the parts. No sales tax is due on the charge for labor. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.290(h); Texas Tax Publication 94-113. See, e.g., Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,489 (May 10, 2016).

Code tit. 34, §3.290(h); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,523 (Aug. 30, 2018). A repairman that separately states a charge for consumables used directly in repairing motor vehicles may collect tax on the charge for the consumables and buy these materials tax-free. However, tools, electricity, and office supplies are taxable. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.290(g)(2); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.290(h)(3); Texas Tax Publication 94-113. Texas defines the term “separated contract”as a written agreement that is divided into a separately stated price for materials and a separately stated price for skill and labor. If prices of materials and labor are separately stated, the fact that the charges are added together and a sum total given is irrelevant. If the contract itself does not contain specific amounts for materials and labor but provides that all invoices will separate the charges for materials from the charges for skill and labor, then Texas regards the contract as a separated contract. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.290(a)(16); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,302 (Jan. 24, 2018). Separately Stated Charges for Parts Performed Under a Warranty A shop that performs services under an extended warranty must collect sales tax on the separately stated parts. Tex. Admin.

Depends Whether a sale of a boat is taxable depends on whether the boat is greater than 65 feet in length. See generally Tex. Tax Code Ann. §160; Texas Tax Publication 94-170. Boats and boat motors are subject to one of two Texas sales taxes: the boat and boat motor sales and use tax or the limited sales and use tax. The boat and boat motor sales and use tax applies to boats that are 65 feet or shorter, measured from the tip of the bow in a straight line to the stern, whereas the limited sales and use tax applies to boats greater than 65 feet in length. The boat and boat motor sales and use tax or the limited sales and use tax are due on boat rentals. See generally Tex. Tax Code Ann. §160; Texas Tax Publication 94-170. Boat and Boat Motor Sales and Use Tax(i.e., for boats 65 feet or shorter) Texas imposes boat and motor sales and use tax on the retail sale of a “taxable boat” or “taxable motor.” See Tex. Tax Code Ann. §160.021; Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.741(c); Texas Tax Publication 94-170. Texas defines the term “taxable boat”as any watercraft (other than a seaplane on water) that is not more than 65 feet long from the tip of the bow in a straight line to the stern. The regulation explains that this includes federally documented boats, motorboats, sailboats, jet skis, and boats designed to accommodate an outboard motor, but it does not include canoes, kayaks, rowboats, inflatable rafts, or other watercraft designed to be propelled by paddle, oar, or pole. Instead, those excluded watercraft are taxed under the limited sales and use tax unless some other exemption applies. See Tex. Tax Code Ann. §160.001(9)(a); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.741(a)(7); Texas Tax Publication 94-170. Boat motors subject to the boat and boat motor sales tax include:• gasoline or diesel outboard motors; and • electric motors attached to a boat subject to the boat and boat motor sales tax and sold for one price (e.g., trolling motors). Texas Tax Publication 94-170. If a transaction involving a boat or boat motor is subject to the boat and boat motor sales tax, then it is exempt from the limited sales and use tax. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.3291(a); Texas Tax Publication 94-170. The boat and boat motor sales tax imposed on a taxable boat or boat motor may not exceed $18,750. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §160.026, as added by 2019 Tex. H.B. 4032, §9, effective Sept. 1, 2019. Temporary in-state use may exempt a boat or boat motor from the boat and boat motor sales tax if it is:• purchased in Texas for use in another state or nation and is removed from Texas within 10 days; • purchased in Texas for use in another state or nation, is placed in a registered boat repair facility for repairs or modifications, and is removed from Texas within 20 days after completion of the repairs or modifications;or • purchased in Texas for use in another state or nation, the owner obtains and displays at all times a temporary use permit under Tex. Tax Code Ann. §160.0247, and is removed from Texas within 90 days after purchase. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §160.0246, as added by 2019 Tex. H.B. 4032, §9, effective Sept. 1, 2019; Tex.

The following entities can purchase boats exempt from the boat and boat motor sales tax:• volunteer fire departments; • the federal government; • Texas state agencies; • Texas cities; • Texas counties; and • other political subdivisions of Texas. Texas Tax Publication 94-170. For more information regarding the boat motor sales tax, see the Excise Tax Navigator, at Texas 9.3. Limited Sales and Use Tax (i.e., for boats longer than 65 feet) The limited sales and use tax applies to boats greater than 65 feet in length (measured from the tip of the bow in a straight line to the stern), as well as to canoes, kayaks, inflatable boats and rafts, punts and boats designed to be propelled only by a paddle or pole. Texas Tax Publication 94-170. The tax is based on the boat's sales price, less any allowance for the trade-in of another boat. Texas Tax Policy News June 2017. Limited sales and use tax also applies to the:• rental or lease of boats or boat motors; • sale of electric motors and accessories (e.g., life jackets or ladders, if sold separately from the boat); and • repair and remodeling of boats and boat motors. Texas Tax Publication 94-170. Limited sales and use tax also applies to boats designed to be propelled by a paddle, oar, or pole, including:• canoes; • kayaks; • inflatable boats; • inflatable rafts; and • punts. Texas Tax Publication 94-170. If a Texas resident buys a boat in another state and brings it into Texas within one year of purchase, the purchaser owes use tax. If a new Texas resident brings a boat into Texas that was previously registered in another state, the new resident owes the new resident $15 boat use tax. Texas Tax Policy News June 2017.

Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Railroad Rolling Stock, Interstate and Common Carrier Purchase, Lease, or Rental Transactions

Exempt Texas exempts purchases of rolling stock, locomotives, and trains from sales and use tax. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.331(a); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.297(f)(1). Neither the Texas tax code nor the regulations defines the term “rolling stock,” See generally Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.331; Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.297. but in Reynolds Metals Co. v. Combs the Texas Court of Appeals concluded that “the Comptroller's application of the exemption . . . demonstrates a consistent policy of tying the rolling stock exemption to traditional railroad equipment.” See Reynolds Metals Co. v. Combs, No. 03-07-00709-CV, 2009 BL 295057 (Tex. App. April 8, 2009); see also Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 45,126 (Oct. 18, 2006); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 39,781 (Jan. 13, 2004); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 36,869 (July 5, 2000). In Reynolds Metals Co., Reynolds was a manufacturing company that produced and manufactured aluminum oxide by extracting alumina from bauxite ore received by ship. Reynolds used ship unloaders to unload the bauxite ore from the ships and dump it onto a series of conveyors for further processing. The ship unloaders at issue were “large, crane-like structures”about 83 feet tall and 82 feet long. They had wheels similar to those found on trains and traveled by rolling on two railroad rails, but otherwise the ship unloaders were not traditional railroad equipment. Nonetheless, Reynolds asserted that they qualified as exempt rolling stock “because they operate on and are supported by rails. The statute was silent regarding the meaning of “rolling stock,”so the scope of that term was at issue. Reynolds Metals Co. v. Combs, No. 03-07-00709-CV, 2009 BL 295057 (Tex. App. April 8, 2009). Reynolds promoted a theory of legislative acceptance, arguing that the Comptroller historically had broadly exempted “any equipment that was operated on railroad rails”but in 2000 had adopted a narrower policy that exempted only “conventional or traditional railroad equipment, or, at the least, equipment mounted on rails that connect to traditional railroads.” However, the court disagreed. Examining the historical context in detail, the court instead concluded that there had not existed a broad pre-2000 policy of exempting any equipment operating on rails. Rather the court held that the relevant rulings “evidence[d] a relationship between the exemption and traditional railroads and railroad equipment.” For example, in a 1990 letter ruling, the Comptroller had determined that the rolling stock exemption applied to train unloaders. But the court concluded that unlike the ship unloaders that Reynolds operated, the train unloaders there were mounted on traditional railroad tracks and were used in conjunction with traditional railroad equipment. Reynolds Metals Co. v. Combs, No. 03-07-00709-CV, 2009 BL 295057 (Tex. App. April 8, 2009), citing Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 9002L0979E06 (Feb. 8, 1990). Similarly, the court concluded that another 1990 letter ruling involving an amusement car train dealt with small-scale traditional railroad equipment such as locomotives, coaches, and trains. Reynolds Metals Co. v. Combs, No. 03-07-00709-CV, 2009 BL 295057 (Tex. App. April 8, 2009), citing Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 9003L0996A01 (March 30, 1990). BNA-SUTN TX 29.8.1.

Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Railroad Rolling Stock, Interstate and Common Carrier Repair Services

Taxable Repair services of railcars and locomotives and other rolling stock are exempt from sales and use tax. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.331; Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.357; Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 42,364. However, labor to repair or remodel nonresidential improvements to realty are subject to sales tax. If a company repairs or remodels a road bed, track, etc., it may separately state its charges for labor and materials and tax only the labor. If it makes a single lump-sum charge for materials and labor, the total charge will be taxed if the labor component is 5-percent or more of the total charge. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.331; Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.357; Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 42,364. In Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 42,364, the taxpayer was a railroad contractor that built new railroads and repaired and maintained existing railroads. During an audit, the taxpayer had asked whether materials incorporated into the railroad track (e.g., rails, ballast, and other track material) qualified as exempt. The Comptroller's response letter had indicated that they did, but the letter did not address the taxability of repair or remodeling labor. The ALJ determined which of the taxpayers charges were taxable or exempt, but more importantly the ALJ clarified that “the repair and renovation of railroad tracks is, for tax purposes, nonresidential real property repair and remodeling”subject to sales tax. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101(a)(13); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0047; see also Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 42,364 (July 2, 2003). The repair of a railroad track is taxable under Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.357. No tax is due on separately stated charges for track and rail bed materials. See generally Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.357. BNA-SUTN TX 29.8.3.

A parking facility refers to a real property structure, such as an improved or unimproved lot or garage, where parking is permitted for a fee, and includes areas that are designed for parking but that may be rented or leased for other purposes. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.315(a)(2). If a contract for the lease or rental of real property includes a charge for motor vehicle parking or storage, sales tax is due on such parking or storage charge. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.315(d); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,629 (April 17, 2018)(taxpayer did not demonstrate that customers were paying for drop-yard services instead of parking services). Although the rental or lease of a parking facility is presumed to be taxable, if the facility is leased for a purpose other than parking (e.g., a flea market) the charge is not subject to tax. However, unless separately stated, charges for a combination of parking and a nontaxable use of the facility is taxable on the lump-sum amount of the charges. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.315(h). In addition, a lease or rental of real property is not subject to sales and use tax unless the transaction involves some element attributable to parking or storage services.
