Exempt General aviation aircraft are exempt from sales and use tax. N.Y. Tax Law §1115(a)(21-a), as added by 2015 N.Y. A.B. 3009, effective Sept. 1, 2015; see also New York TSB-M-15(3)S (July 24, 2015). Additionally, machinery and equipment to be installed on general aviation aircraft is exempt. N.Y. Tax Law §1115(a)(21-a), as added by 2015 N.Y. A.B. 3009, effective Sept. 1, 2015; see also New York TSB-M-15(3)S (July 24, 2015). “General aviation aircraft” means an aircraft used in civil aviation that is not a commercial or military aircraft or an unmanned aerial vehicle or drone. N.Y. Tax Law §1115(a)(21-a) The exemption applies to the receipts for sale, lease, or rental of the following:• the aircraft itself; • other property that is affixed to the aircraft for its equipping (e.g., furniture, fixtures, built-in appliances, window coverings, climate control systems, or entertainment systems); and • property that the aircraft is outfitted with at the time of sale that is necessary for its normal operation (e.g., avionics, radios, weather radar systems, and navigation and emergency lighting). New York TSB-M-15(3)S (July 24, 2015). The exemption applies to sales (including leases subject to the accelerated tax payment provisions of section 1111(i)of the Tax Law) or uses occurring on or after Sept. 1, 2015. The exemption also applies to sales made under a contract entered into prior to Sept. 1, 2015, if the purchaser takes delivery of the aircraft or the machinery or equipment on or after Sept. 1, 2015. New York TSB-M-15(3)S (July 24, 2015). Fractional Ownership of Aircraft The Department of Taxation and Finance has issued an advisory opinion concluding that the sale or lease of a fractional share of an aircraft is the sale of a nontaxable air transportation service. New York TSB-A-17(1)S (Feb. 3, 2017). In a fractional share ownership transaction, the fractional share owner purchases an interest in an aircraft that entitles such owner to a specific number of annual flight hours based on the size of his or her share, which can range between a 1/16th share and 16/16ths share. The fractional share owner receives title to the fractional interest in the aircraft, which is documented and filed with the Federal Aviation Administration. The Department has determined that because the transaction does not transfer possession, command, and control of the aircraft to the fractional share owner, and the seller of the shares retains the exclusive right to arrange flights and provide pilots and crew, and remains responsible for the aircraft maintenance, the fractional share owner has purchased a nontaxable service. Dominion and control over the aircraft has not been transferred, thus, the transaction does not constitute the sale of tangible personal property. New York TSB-A-17(1)S (Feb. 3, 2017). The Department additionally concluded that the sale of an aircraft that is retired for the fractional share ownership program is an exempt sale of a general aviation aircraft. New York TSB-A-17(1)S (Feb. 3, 2017). Leases of Noncommercial Aircraft N.Y. Tax Law §1111(i) imposes a special payment regime for sales and use tax on certain leases of noncommercial aircraft. Instead of tax being due upon each periodic lease payment required under the lease, as is the case with other leases, the Tax Law requires the lessee to pay sales tax at the inception of the lease on the total amount of the lease payments for the entire term of the lease. The statute and regulations achieve this result by deeming all receipts due or consideration given or contracted to be given under the lease as having been paid or given at the inception of the lease. Therefore, no refund is allowed based upon the fact that receipts are not actually paid, as in the case of early termination of a lease, failure to exercise an option to renew a lease, or bad debt. N.Y. Tax Law §1111(i); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.15(a). Only noncommercial aircraft leases for a term of one year or more fall within this special sales tax payment regime. However, the term “lease for a term of one year or more”is statutorily defined to include any lease for a shorter term that includes an option to renew or other like provision where the cumulative time period that the lease may be in effect upon exercise of such option or provision is one year or more. N.Y. Tax Law §1111(i); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.15(c)(2)(I). BNA-SUTN NY 29.1.1.

Depends Motor vehicles are taxable as tangible personal property, unless sold to a nonresident or another exemption applies. N.Y. Tax Law §1105(a). Any credit amount for a trade-in vehicle which the vendor intends for resale is excluded from the sales price. N.Y. Tax Law §1101(b)(3). Title registration will not be issued until the commissioner has received proof that the sales and use tax has been paid. N.Y. Tax Law §1132(f). Sales of motor vehicles to nonresidents of New York are exempt from state and local sales tax. A nonresident is a purchaser that does not have a place of abode in New York, will not use the motor vehicle in carrying on any employment, trade, business, or profession in New York, and will not register the vehicle in the state.

To qualify, the vehicle must weigh at least 26,000 pounds, measure at least 40 feet in length, and be used to transport persons for hire by a certified or permitted omnibus carrier. New York TB-ST-890. Sales to Related Persons Sales of motor vehicles by the owner to his/her spouse, child, or parent are exempt from sales and use tax provided that the owner is not a dealer, as defined in Vehicle and Traffic Law §415 and clarified in N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §528.15(b)(2). N.Y. Tax Law §1115(a)(14); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §528.15. Leases of Motor Vehicles N.Y. Tax Law §1111(i) imposes a special payment regime for sales and use tax on certain leases of motor vehicles, vessels and noncommercial aircraft. Instead of tax being due upon each periodic lease payment required under the lease, as is the case with other leases, the Tax Law requires the lessee to pay sales tax at the inception of the lease on the total amount of the lease payments for the entire term of the lease. The statute and regulations achieve this result by deeming all receipts due or consideration given or contracted to be given under the lease as having been paid or given at the inception of the lease. Therefore, no refund is allowed based upon the fact that receipts are not actually paid, as in the case of early termination of a lease, failure to exercise an option to renew a lease, or bad debt. N.Y. Tax Law §1111(i); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.15(a); In re Greenfield, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 827851 (Sept. 27, 2018). No refund of prepaid sales tax is allowed even when the vehicle was stolen, destroyed or moved out of state. In re Moerdler, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 816969 (April 26, 2001); In re Miehle, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 816201 (Aug. 24, 2000). Only motor vehicle leases for a term of one year or more fall within this special sales tax payment regime. However, the term “lease for a term of one year or more” is statutorily defined to include any lease for a shorter term that includes an option to renew or other like provision where the cumulative time period that the lease may be in effect upon exercise of such option or provision is one year or more. N.Y. Tax Law §1111(i); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.15(c)(2)(I). For purposes of payment of tax at the inception of a lease, ‘motor vehicle' means a vehicle with a gross weight of 10,000 pounds or less. N.Y. Tax Law §1111(i); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.15(b)(3). Any vehicle with a gross vehicle weight of more than 10,000 pounds that is leased or rented is not subject to N.Y. Tax Law §1111(i). Tax on such vehicles must be imposed upon each lease payment due over the term of the lease. See N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §541.9(c)(1)(i); New York TSB-A-08(27)S (June 9, 2008). Receipts for an excess mileage or use charge, excess wear charge, or a damage assessment are subject to tax at the time they are paid or due from the lessee. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.15(c)(6). When a lessor accepts a vehicle for resale as a trade-in on a lease agreement, the total receipts do not include the value of the trade-in. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.15(c)(5); New York TSB-A-96(19)S (March 22, 1996); New York TSB-A-95(20)S (June 12, 1995); New York TSB-A-10(53)S (Oct. 18, 2010) (an automobile dealer, acting as agent for a leasing company, may allow a customer a credit for the value of a trade-in vehicle against the capitalized cost of the vehicle to be leased, the New York Department of Taxation and Finance ruled, noting that if the credit reduced the payments due under the lease, the amount subject to sales tax also would be reduced). Renewal options are included in the computation of the tax, whether or not they are exercised or are for a period of one year or more. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.15(c)(1). Third, the lessor must apply the rate of tax that is in effect for the local jurisdiction where the vehicle, vessel or aircraft is regularly garaged, moored, hangared or stored. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.15(c)(3). Any use tax due is similarly based upon the rate in effect in the jurisdiction in New York where the property is regularly garaged, moored, hangared or stored. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.15(d)(2). A Terminal Rental Adjustment Clause (TRAC) means a provision of an agreement, such as a lease, which permits or requires the lease price to be adjusted upward or downward by reference to the amount realized by the lessor under the lease upon sale or other disposition of a motor vehicle (or other property). I.R.C. §7701(h)(3)(a). A TRAC lease is considered a lease and is subject to tax accordingly. N.Y. Veh. & Traf. Law § 397-b. Local Sales and Use Taxes New York taxes leases and rentals of motor vehicles. N.Y. Tax Law §1105(a); N.Y. Tax Law §1101(b)(5). New York authorizes cities and counties to impose local sales and use taxes in one of two ways. Under the first method of imposing local sales and use tax, the local sales and use tax applies to the same base as the state sales and use tax. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(iv)(a)(1), as amended by 2019 N.Y. A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019. Under the second method, a jurisdiction may, but is not required to, impose a tax on certain transactions that comprise the state tax base. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(iv)(b)(1), as amended by 2019 N.Y. A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019. However, charges for motor vehicle rentals are not among the qualifying transactions. N.Y. Tax Law §1105(a) - N.Y. Tax Law §1105(f); N.Y. Tax Law §1210(iv)(b)(1), as amended by 2019 N.Y. A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019.

Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §528.15(b)(2). N.Y. Tax Law §1115(a)(14); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §528.15. Leases of Motor Vehicles N.Y. Tax Law §1111(i) imposes a special payment regime for sales and use tax on certain leases of motor vehicles, vessels and noncommercial aircraft. Instead of tax being due upon each periodic lease payment required under the lease, as is the case with other leases, the Tax Law requires the lessee to pay sales tax at the inception of the lease on the total amount of the lease payments for the entire term of the lease. The statute and regulations achieve this result by deeming all receipts due or consideration given or contracted to be given under the lease as having been paid or given at the inception of the lease. Therefore, no refund is allowed based upon the fact that receipts are not actually paid, as in the case of early termination of a lease, failure to exercise an option to renew a lease, or bad debt. N.Y. Tax Law §1111(i); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.15(a); In re Greenfield, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 827851 (Sept. 27, 2018). Only motor vehicle leases for a term of one year or more fall within this special sales tax payment regime. However, the term “lease for a term of one year or more” is statutorily defined to include any lease for a shorter term that includes an option to renew or other like provision where the cumulative time period that the lease may be in effect upon exercise of such option or provision is one year or more. N.Y. Tax Law §1111(i); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.15(c)(2)(I). For purposes of payment of tax at the inception of a lease, motor vehicle means a vehicle with a gross weight of 10,000 pounds or less. N.Y. Tax Law §1111(i); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.15(b)(3). Any vehicle with a gross vehicle weight of more than 10,000 pounds that is leased or rented is not subject to N.Y. Tax Law §1111(i). Tax on such vehicles must be imposed upon each lease payment due over the term of the lease. See N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §541.9(c)(1)(i); New York TSB-A-08(27)S (June 9, 2008). Receipts for an excess mileage or use charge, excess wear charge, or a damage assessment are subject to tax at the time they are paid or due from the lessee. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.15(c)(6). When a lessor accepts a vehicle for resale as a trade-in on a lease agreement, the total receipts do not include the value of the trade-in. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.15(c)(5); New York TSB-A-96(19)S (March 22, 1996); New York TSB-A-95(20)S (June 12, 1995); New York TSB-A-10(53)S (Oct. 18, 2010) (an automobile dealer, acting as agent for a leasing company, may allow a customer a credit for the value of a trade-in vehicle against the capitalized cost of the vehicle to be leased, the New York Department of Taxation and Finance ruled, noting that if the credit reduced the payments due under the lease, the amount subject to sales tax also would be reduced). Renewal options are included in the computation of the tax, whether or not they are exercised or are for a period of one year or more. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.15(c)(1). Third, the lessor must apply the rate of tax that is in effect for the local jurisdiction where the vehicle, vessel or aircraft is regularly garaged, moored, hangared or stored. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.15(c)(3). Any use tax due is similarly based upon the rate in effect in the jurisdiction in New York where the property is regularly garaged, moored, hangared or stored. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.15(d)(2). A Terminal Rental Adjustment Clause (TRAC) means a provision of an agreement, such as a lease, which permits or requires the lease price to be adjusted upward or downward by reference to the amount realized by the lessor under the lease upon sale or other disposition of a motor vehicle (or other property). I.R.C. §7701(h)(3)(a). A TRAC lease is considered a lease and is subject to tax accordingly. N.Y. Veh. & Traf. Law § 397-b. Local Sales and Use Taxes New York taxes leases and rentals of motor vehicles. N.Y. Tax Law §1105(a); N.Y. Tax Law §1101(b)(5). New York authorizes cities and counties to impose local sales and use taxes in one of two ways. Under the first method of imposing local sales and use tax, the local sales and use tax applies to the same base as the state sales and use tax. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(iv)(a)(1), as amended by 2019 N.Y. A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019. Under the second method, a jurisdiction may, but is not required to, impose a tax on certain transactions that comprise the state tax base. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(iv)(b)(1), as amended by 2019 N.Y. A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019. However, charges for motor vehicle rentals are not among the qualifying transactions. N.Y. Tax Law §1105(a) - (f); N.Y. Tax Law §1210(iv)(b)(1), as amended by 2019 N.Y. A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019. Therefore, leases and rentals of motor vehicles are subject to the local sales and use tax if the jurisdiction imposes its tax under the first method.

A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019. Under the second method, a jurisdiction may, but is not required to, impose a tax on certain transactions that comprise the state tax base. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(iv)(b)(1), as amended by 2019 N.Y. A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019. However, charges for transportation services are not among the qualifying transactions. N.Y.
