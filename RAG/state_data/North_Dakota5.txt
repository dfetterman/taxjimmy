Nontaxable In North Dakota, sales and use tax applies only to tangible personal property and services, so real property is not subject to these taxes. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-02.1; N.D. Cent. Code §57-40.2-02.1; see also N.D. Admin. Code §81-04.1-01-01. BNA-SUTN ND 28.1.

Depends In North Dakota, purchases of items that will become fixtures and fixtures themselves are subject to sales and use tax North Dakota Guideline Sales, Use and Gross Receipts Tax Requirements (Jan. 2012); North Dakota Guideline Gross Receipts Tax Requirements (Jan. 2012). See also North Dakota 2014 State and Local Tax Guide. Tangible personal property that becomes realty upon installation is taxable upon the sale to the individual who installed the property. Contractors who install personal property into real estate are always subject to sales or use tax on the cost of such property, regardless of who owns it. It is the responsibility of the contractor to pay tax on all materials installed into real estate unless the person who owns the materials has already paid a sales or use tax on them. N.D. Admin. Code §81-04.1-04-20; North Dakota Guideline—Contractors (Jan. 2012); North Dakota Guideline—Repair Services (Feb. 2005). The North Dakota Supreme Court has held when a person buys an item of tangible personal property for the purposes of incorporating it in or attaching it to real property, the sale cannot be considered as being either for processing or for resale but is a taxable sale at retail when the contractor purchases the item unless it is an exempt entity. The term “product”used in the definition of “processing” means personal property and not real estate. Also the Court held that a work or structure such as a road, street, bridge, dam or permanent building that becomes part of the real estate is not a product. N. Improvement Co. v. Engen, 68 N.W.2d 463 (N.D. 1954). Any transaction where a home furnishings supply store or contractor sells and installs tangible personal property, including carpet, draperies and drapery hardware, the supplier or contractor will be subject to sales or use tax on its cost of all materials. North Dakota Guideline—Home Furnishings Supply Store (April 1997). The supplier of the property and service may complete the installation on its own or have a representative, such as a subcontractor, complete the installation and in either instance, the supplier is responsible for the sales or use tax on the cost of the materials and supplies used in the performance of the contract. North Dakota Guideline—Home Furnishings Supply Store (April 1997). For installation for government agencies, schools or other tax-exempt institutions, the supplier must still pay sales or use tax on the purchase price of all materials installed. This is true even if the exempt institution purchases the materials and then contracts separately with the supplier to install the materials. North Dakota Guideline—Home Furnishings Supply Store (April 1997). BNA-SUTN ND 28.2.1.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Construction Materials and Contracts Construction Materials and Contracts, Generally

Taxable North Dakota law imposes use tax on all tangible personal property used by a contractor or a subcontractor in the performance of a contract, regardless of who purchased and owns the tangible personal property. The tax is calculated based on the purchase price or fair market value of the tangible personal property, whichever is higher. N.D. Cent. Code §57-40.2-03.3(1); N. X-Ray Co. v. Tax Comm'r, 542 N.W.2d 733 (N.D. 1996). The North Dakota Supreme Court has held when a person buys an item of tangible personal property for the purposes of incorporating it in or attaching it to real property, the sale cannot be considered as being either for processing or for resale but is a taxable sale at retail when the contractor purchases the item unless it is an exempt entity. The term “product”used in the definition of “processing” means personal property and not real estate. Also the Court held that a work or structure such as a road, street, bridge, dam or permanent building that becomes part of the real estate is not a product. N. Improvement Co. v. Engen, 68 N.W.2d 463 (N.D. 1954); N.D. Admin. Code §81-04.1-04-20; North Dakota Guideline—Contractors (Jan. 2012); North Dakota Guideline—Repair Services (Feb. 2005). A contractor is subject to sales or use tax on the supplies, materials and equipment purchased to complete construction contracts. However, a contractor is allowed to make purchases of supplies and materials without payment of sales tax to the seller as long as the contractor executes a Contractor's Certificate. This certificate certifies that the contractor will be directly responsible for the sales tax on the materials being purchased by reporting the purchase as items subject to use tax on the sales and use tax return. A contractor must have a North Dakota sales and use tax permit to execute a certificate. North Dakota Guideline—Contractors (Jan. 2012). Local Use Tax Contractors and subcontractors who use tangible personal property in the performance of construction contracts within a taxing jurisdiction are also subject to city or county use tax. Any such local tax imposed may be paid directly to the seller of goods or may be accrued by the contractor for later payment directly to the Office of State Tax Commissioner. Under state law, unless a local city or county sales or use tax has already been paid by the contractor or subcontractor on the goods being used, a contractor or subcontractor is subject to the state use tax regardless of who owns the goods. N.D. Cent. Code §57-40.2-03.3(1); N.D. Cent. Code §11-09.1-05(2)(a); N.D. Cent. Code §40-05.1-06(16)(a); North Dakota Guideline—Local Option Taxes by Location, effective Jan. 1, 2016. Construction materials are subject to local tax if:• purchased from a retailer located inside a taxing jurisdiction for use inside that taxing jurisdiction. • purchased elsewhere but stored, used or consumed inside a taxing jurisdiction. The local tax due is reduced by the local tax legally due and paid to another city or county. N.D. Cent. Code §57-40.2-03.3(1); N.D. Cent. Code §11-09.1-05(2)(a); N.D. Cent. Code §40-05.1-06(16)(a); North Dakota Guideline—Local Option Taxes by Location, effective Jan. 1, 2016. Contractors who provide a contractor's certificate to avoid payment of sales tax at the time construction materials are purchased are subject to the city or county use tax when the goods are installed, regardless of whether the goods are used inside or outside of a taxing jurisdiction. The tax is owed to the taxing jurisdiction where the goods were purchased. N.D. Cent. Code §57-40.2-03.3(1); N.D. Cent. Code §11-09.1-05(2)(a); N.D. Cent. Code §40-05.1-06(16)(a); North Dakota Guideline—Local Option Taxes by Location, effective Jan. 1, 2016. Currently, various local sales tax ordinances provide a limited exemption for materials that are purchased within the jurisdiction, but later installed, and thereby considered used, outside of the jurisdiction where the sale took place. North Dakota Guideline—Local Option Taxes by Location, effective Jan. 1, 2016 (listing all jurisdictions providing a limited exemption for materials purchased within their jurisdiction but later used outside of their jurisdiction). To qualify for the limited exemption, a contractor must provide the supplier with a valid Contractor's Certificate at the time of purchase and request to be exempt from both state and local sales taxes. When the goods are later used, the contractor must pay state use tax on the cost of the goods. A local use tax is owed to the city or county where the goods are installed, but only if the goods are installed within a city or county that imposes a local use tax. N.D. Cent. Code §57-40.2-03.3(1); North Dakota Guideline—Local Option Taxes by Location, effective Jan. 1, 2016. A Contractor's Certificate may also be used in all other taxing jurisdictions that impose local sales, use and gross receipts taxes but that do not allow the limited exemption. In this situation when the materials are used, a use tax is due to the local jurisdiction where the materials were purchased regardless of where the materials were installed. If the Contractor's Certificate is not provided at the time of purchase of the goods, then city, county and state sales tax are due at the time of the purchase. N.D. Cent. Code §57-40.2-03.3(1); North Dakota Guideline—Local Option Taxes by Location, effective Jan. 1, 2016. Construction materials are not subject to local tax if the goods were purchased from a retailer located in a taxing jurisdiction, but delivered by the retailer outside the taxing jurisdiction for use outside of that taxing jurisdiction. N.D. Cent. Code §57-40.2-03.3(1); North Dakota Guideline—Local Option Taxes by Location, effective Jan. 1, 2016. In other words, if construction materials were already taxed in the jurisdiction where the goods were purchased, the delivery and subsequent use of those goods outside the taxing jurisdiction will not give rise to an additional use tax. It is important to note that the maximum tax, also known as a refund cap, is calculated on each material purchase a contractor makes to fulfill a construction contract, not on purchase orders or the entire construction contract itself. Accordingly, most construction activity that is subject to local sales or use tax will include more than the specified refund cap in total local tax costs. While retailers are required to collect the full amount of sales tax for retail sales, customers may apply for a refund of local tax collected in excess of the refund cap, when use tax is accrued, it should be accrued up to the cap amount only. N.D. Cent. Code §57-01-02.1(5); North Dakota Guideline—Local Option Taxes by Location, effective Jan. 1, 2016. Sales or Use Tax Paid to Another State If the machinery and equipment being used by a contractor within the state was purchased or used outside of the state prior to entering the state, no North Dakota sales or use tax is due. This is the case so long as the sales or use tax was paid at the time of purchase or use in that other state. N.D. Cent. Code §57-40.2-11. However if the amount paid to the other state is less than the amount imposed by North Dakota, the difference between the two amounts is owed to the state. N.D. Cent. Code §57-40.2-11. Purchases Made in Other States When contractors purchase tools, machinery, equipment, or materials and supplies outside of the state for use within the state, and not for resale or processing, they are required to file a sales and use tax return and pay use tax on such purchases. If the supplier of the goods holds a North Dakota sales and use tax permit, use tax should be paid to the supplier. N.D. Cent. Code §57-40.2-11; North Dakota Guideline—Contractors (Jan. 2012). Materials Purchased in North Dakota for Installation Out-of-State Contractors making purchases of material within the state for installation into real estate located outside of the state are required to pay sales tax to North Dakota. Tax should be paid directly to the seller, however, if the contractor signs a Certificate for the seller and pays no tax at the time of the sale, the contractor is responsible for payment of tax directly to the Office of State Tax Commissioner. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-04(12)(b); N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-04(15); N.D. Admin. Code §81.04.1-04.20; North Dakota Guideline—Contractors (Jan. 2012). An exception is made when a contractor buys materials within the state for installation into real property in Montana. The contractor is not responsible for payment of North Dakota sales or use tax on materials purchased in North Dakota for installation in Montana. North Dakota Guideline—Contractors (Jan. 2012). Contractor's Procedures in Billing Customers As the ultimate user or consumer of all materials, supplies and equipment incorporated as improvements to real property, a contractor or subcontractor is regarded as the final user and responsible for the payment of sales or use tax on all purchases of materials, supplies and equipment. N.D. Cent. Code §57-40.2-03.3; N.D. Admin. Code §81.04.1-04.20; North Dakota Guideline—Contractors (Jan. 2012). The sales or use tax paid by the contractor or subcontractor on such materials can be passed on to the customer as part of the materials cost, but cannot be itemized as a sales tax charge on the customer's invoice. North Dakota Guideline—Contractors (Jan. 2012). Sand, Rock, and Dirt The sale of sand, rock, dirt or scoria is regarded as an installation into real property if the sales contract requires the contractor to move or place the product after it has been dumped. Charges, in this situation, are not taxable to the customer but the contractor or subcontractor has the responsibility to pay sales or use tax on the cost of these materials. N.D. Cent. Code §57-40.2-03.3(1); North Dakota Guideline—Contractors (Jan. 2012). Sand or gravel that is severed from land owned by a contractor and later installed into real property by that contractor is subject to use tax based on a value of $.08 per ton. If sand or gravel is purchased by the contractor from another source, and installed into real property by the contractor, the contractor is obligated for sales or use tax based on the purchase price. If the contractor pays a royalty to a land owner, the contractor is responsible to pay sales or use tax based on the royalty agreement. North Dakota Sales Tax Newsletter July 2017. If the sand, rock, dirt or scoria is simply dumped in a pile, or if the contractor or subcontractor is not required to level the materials after they have been dumped (such as where the contractor “truck-spreads” the product), the sale is regarded as a retail sale subject to sales tax. The total charge to the customer for the materials, including delivery charges, is subject to sales tax. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-02.1; North Dakota Sales Tax Newsletter July 2017; North Dakota Guideline—Contractors (Jan. 2012). Sales to truckers, haulers, and businesses who resell the sand, gravel, or scoria are exempt from sales tax when the purchaser provides a properly completed and signed certificate of resale. When sand or gravel is procured at the pit for delivery at the pit to a purchaser who has employed a trucker or hauler, the operator of the pit must collect and remit the tax. North Dakota Sales Tax Newsletter July 2017. Agricultural Commodity Processing Facility An agricultural commodity processing facility is a manufacturing facility that processes agricultural commodities into marketable products. A facility, such as a grain elevator, that only stores, cleans, dries, or transports agricultural commodities, is not an agricultural commodity processing facility. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-04.4.; N.D. Admin. Code §81-04.1-01-23.2. Tangible personal property consumed during the construction of an agricultural commodity processing facility, or tangible personal property that becomes incorporated into the structure of such facility are exempt from sales and use tax. However, a contractor who consumes or installs the materials must first pay the sales or use taxes and the owner of the agricultural processing facility must apply in writing for a refund of the taxes paid by the contractor. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-04.4.; N.D. Admin. Code §81-04.1-01-23.2; see Office of State Tax Comm'r, 2015/16 Tax Incentives for Businesses. The sale of coal used in agricultural processing is exempt from sales tax. N.D. Cent. Code § 57-39.2-04(44).

Yes A contractor or subcontractor is a person who engages in the business of construction, repair, alteration, dismantling, or demolition of every type of structure, project, development, or improvement of real or personal property, including the construction, alteration, or repair of property to be held either for sale or rental. N.D. Cent. Code §43-07-01(1). Contractors perform work on bridges, highways, roads, streets, buildings, airports, dams, drainage or irrigation ditches, sewers, water or gas mains, water filters, tanks, towers, oil, gas, or water pipelines and other types of real property. N.D. Cent. Code §43-07-01(1). A contractor or subcontractor who installs materials into real property that is located within the state borders is responsible for paying the state sales or use tax on the materials. This is true, even if the contractor or subcontractor is doing work for an exempt entity, and that entity has purchased the materials to be used. In this scenario, the contractor would be responsible for paying the use tax applicable on the materials, based upon the price of the materials. N.D. Admin. Code §81-04.1-04-20; North Dakota Guideline—Contractors (Jan. 2012); North Dakota Guideline—Repair Services (Feb. 2005). In other words, the contractors engaged in retail trade should provide their suppliers with a signed Certificate of Resale for their purchases thereby exempting their purchases from sales tax. A Certificate of Resale accepted by a supplier relieves the supplier of the responsibility of collecting sales tax from the buyer. North Dakota Guideline—Contractors (Jan. 2012). BNA-SUTN ND 28.5.
