Topic: Utilities, Fuel, Mining and Natural Resource Extraction, Production, Sale Fuel Compressed Natural Gas

Exempt or Partial Effective July 1, 2018, sales of compressed natural gas are exempt from sales and use tax if subjected to excise tax as special fuel or purchased for residential use; natural gas purchased for other uses receives a partial exemption. La. Const. art. VII, §2.2; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:305(D)(1)(a); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:305(D)(1)(g); Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin 18-016 (July 11, 2018); Louisiana Publication R-1002 (June 2018) (table of sales tax exemptions and reduced rates); see 2018 La. H.B. 10, Third Extraordinary Session, effective July 1, 2018. Compressed Natural Gas Used as a Special Fuel Compressed natural gas sold, used, or consumed in Louisiana for the operation of motor vehicles is considered a special fuel subject to excise tax, and is therefore exempt from sales and use tax. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:818.111; La. Const. art. VII, §27; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:711; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:302(X)(6), as enacted by2016 La. H.B. 61 and 2016 La. H.B. 62, First Extraordinary Session, effective April 1, 2016; Louisiana Publication R-1002A (January 2017). For additional information about Louisiana's special fuels taxes, see the Excise Tax Navigator, at Louisiana 8.2. Natural Gas for Residential Use Louisiana provides a constitutional exemption from sales and use tax for sales of natural gas sold directly to the consumer for residential use by that consumer. La. Const. art. VII, §2.2(B)(2); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:305(D)(1)(g); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:302(BB)(2), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:321(P)(2), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:321.1(I)(2), and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:331(V)(2), as amended by 2018 La. H.B. 10, Third Extraordinary Session, effective July 1, 2018; Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin 18-016 (July 11, 2018); Louisiana Publication R-1002 (June 2018) (table of sales tax exemptions and reduced rates). Despite the frequent changes to the list of allowable sales tax exemptions in recent years, natural gas purchased for residential use has remained exempt because it is exempted by a provision of the state constitution. La. Const. art. VII, §2.2(B)(2); see Louisiana Publication R-1002A (January 2017) (providing historical exemption and rate information for various types of tangible personal property and taxable services). The phrase “sold directly to the consumer for residential use” includes furnishing natural gas to private residences, including the separate private units of apartment houses and other multiple dwellings, actually used for residential purposes, which residences are separately metered or measured, regardless of the fact that a person other than the resident is contractually bound to the supplier for the charges, actually pays the charges, or is billed for the charges. The use of natural gas in hotel or motel units does not constitute residential use. La. Const. art. VII, §2.2(C). Residential uses generally include activities such as heating homes, heating water, cooking, drying clothes, and fueling gas fireplaces. Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin No. 16-021 (April 7, 2016); see also Louisiana Private Letter Ruling 10-027 (Oct. 18, 2010).

La. Const. art. VII, §2.2; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:305(D)(1)(a); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:305(D)(1)(g); Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin 18-016 (July 11, 2018); Louisiana Publication R-1002 (June 2018) (table of sales tax exemptions and reduced rates); see 2018 La. H.B. 10, Third Extraordinary Session, effective July 1, 2018. Liquefied Natural Gas Used as a Special Fuel Liquefied natural gas sold, used, or consumed in Louisiana for the operation of motor vehicles is considered a special fuel subject to excise tax, and is therefore exempt from sales and use tax. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:818.111; La. Const. art. VII, §27; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:711; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:302(X)(6), as enacted by 2016 La. H.B. 61 and 2016 La. H.B. 62, First Extraordinary Session, effective April 1, 2016; Louisiana Publication R-1002A (January 2017). For additional information about Louisiana's special fuels taxes, see the Excise Tax Navigator, at Louisiana 8.2. Natural Gas for Residential Use Louisiana provides a constitutional exemption from sales and use tax for sales of natural gas sold directly to the consumer for residential use by that consumer. La. Const. art. VII, §2.2(B)(2); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:305(D)(1)(g); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:302(BB)(2), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:321(P)(2), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:321.1(I)(2), and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:331(V)(2), as amended by 2016 La. H.B. 61, First Extraordinary Session, effective April 1, 2016; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:321.1(F)(2), as amended by 2018 La.

Despite the frequent changes to the list of allowable sales tax exemptions in recent years, natural gas purchased for residential use has remained exempt because it is exempted by a provision of the state constitution. La. Const. art. VII, §2.2(B)(2); see Louisiana Publication R-1002A (January 2017) (providing historical exemption and rate information for various types of tangible personal property and taxable services). The phrase “sold directly to the consumer for residential use” includes furnishing natural gas to private residences, including the separate private units of apartment houses and other multiple dwellings, actually used for residential purposes, which residences are separately metered or measured, regardless of the fact that a person other than the resident is contractually bound to the supplier for the charges, actually pays the charges, or is billed for the charges. The use of natural gas in hotel or motel units does not constitute residential use. La. Const. art. VII, §2.2(C). Residential uses generally include activities such as heating homes, heating water, cooking, drying clothes, and fueling gas fireplaces.

Definition of ‘Natural Gas' Louisiana does not define the term “natural gas” with respect to sales tax. However, the Department of Revenue explains that Louisiana construes the term “natural gas” “in accordance with the common usage of the language.” The department utilizes the Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary to define the term “natural gas” to mean “gas issuing from the earth's crust through natural openings or bored wells; a combustible mixture of methane and higher hydrocarbons used chiefly as a fuel and raw material; gas manufactured from organic matter (as coal).” Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin No. 16-021 (April 7, 2016); see also Louisiana Private Letter Ruling 10-027 (Oct. 18, 2010).

Ann. §47:301(10)(x) published by the Louisiana State Law Institute from July 1, 2008, through March 31, 2016, incorrectly removed the requirement that fuel or gas other than butane or propane be purchased for residential use in order to qualify for exemption. The Louisiana legislature restated the version of the law published by the Law Institute in 2016 La. H.B. 62, effective April 1, 2016, thereby officially removing the residential use requirement. The residential use requirement was reinstated effective June 26, 2017, via 2017 La. H.B. 629. See Metals USA Plates & Shapes Southeast, Inc. v. Louisiana Dept. of Rev., 2018 BL 108116 (La. Ct.

Exempt or Partial Effective July 1, 2018, sales of compressed natural gas are exempt from sales and use tax if purchased for residential use or subjected to excise tax as special fuel; natural gas purchased for other uses receives a partial exemption. La. Const. art. VII, §2.2; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:305(D)(1)(a); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:305(D)(1)(g); Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin 18-016 (July 11, 2018); Louisiana Publication R-1002 (June 2018) (table of sales tax exemptions and reduced rates); see 2018 La. H.B. 10, Third Extraordinary Session, effective July 1, 2018. Natural Gas for Residential Use Louisiana provides a constitutional exemption from sales and use tax for sales of natural gas sold directly to the consumer for residential use by that consumer. La. Const. art. VII, §2.2(B)(2); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:305(D)(1)(g); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:302(BB)(2), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:321(P)(2), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:321.1(I)(2), and La. Rev. Stat.

Despite the frequent changes to the list of allowable sales tax exemptions in recent years, natural gas purchased for residential use has remained exempt because it is exempted by a provision of the state constitution. La. Const. art. VII, §2.2(B)(2); see Louisiana Publication R-1002A (January 2017) (providing historical exemption and rate information for various types of tangible personal property and taxable services). The phrase “sold directly to the consumer for residential use” includes furnishing natural gas to private residences, including the separate private units of apartment houses and other multiple dwellings, actually used for residential purposes, which residences are separately metered or measured, regardless of the fact that a person other than the resident is contractually bound to the supplier for the charges, actually pays the charges, or is billed for the charges. The use of natural gas in hotel or motel units does not constitute residential use. La. Const. art. VII, §2.2(C). Residential uses generally include activities such as heating homes, heating water, cooking, drying clothes, and fueling gas fireplaces. Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin No. 16-021 (April 7, 2016); see also Louisiana Private Letter Ruling 10-027 (Oct. 18, 2010). Compressed Natural Gas Used as a Special Fuel Compressed natural gas sold, used, or consumed in Louisiana for the operation of motor vehicles is considered a special fuel subject to excise tax, and is therefore exempt from sales and use tax. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:818.111; La. Const. art. VII, §27; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:711; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:302(X)(6), as enacted by2016 La. H.B. 61 and 2016 La.
