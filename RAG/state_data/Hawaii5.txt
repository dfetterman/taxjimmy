Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Real Property

Depends For purposes of Hawaii's general excise tax, gross income does not include gross receipts from the sale of improved or unimproved land. However, interest income that is received on installment payments from the sale of land is subject to tax. In re Tax Appeal of Grayco Land Escrow Ltd., 559 P.2d 264 (Haw. 1977). A person receiving gross income from the rental of a condominium, cooperative apartment, or any other residential real property is deemed to be engaged in business and therefore is subject to the general excise tax on gross income received from the rentals. Hawaii Tax Information Release No. 1990-13. The general excise tax applies to the total amount of payment received by a taxpayer from a lessee as consideration for use of the real property. Hawaii Tax Information Release No. 1992-5. Total payments include, but are not limited to, real property taxes and common area maintenance fees. Hawaii Tax Information Release No. 1992-5. Generally, a general excise tax license should be obtained from the taxation district officer where a taxpayer resides, or alternatively, from the taxation district where rental property is situated. Hawaii Tax Information Release No. 1990-13. Hawaii law generally prevents the pyramiding of the general excise tax on real property that is subleased by allowing a lessee who leases real property from a lessor a deduction from rental income received when subleasing the same real property to a sublessee. Haw. Regs. §§18-237-16.5-01 to 18-237-16.5-07. The lessee (i.e., sublessor)is allowed a 87.5 percent deduction from rental income received by the lessee from a sublessee. Haw. Regs. §18-237-16.5-03; Hawaii Announcement No. 1998-23. This deduction was temporarily suspended from July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2013. Haw. Regs. §18-237-16.5-03;2011 Haw.
