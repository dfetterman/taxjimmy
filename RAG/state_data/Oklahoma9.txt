Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

True Object Test The Oklahoma Tax Commission uses the true object test. Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-1-2, Bundled Transaction. Under the true object test, if the true object of the transaction is to receive a taxable piece of tangible personal property or a taxable service, then the entire charge is taxable. However, if the purpose is to receive a nontaxable service or an exempt piece of property, then the entire charge is not subject to tax. Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-1-2, Bundled Transaction; see also Oklahoma Letter Ruling LR-06-081 (May 24, 2006) (stating that sales by commercial photographers were taxable because the object of the transaction was to transfer prints, negatives, or transparencies); Oklahoma Letter Ruling LR-02-061 (May 14, 2002) (stating that the sale of a commissioned original artwork was taxable because the purchaser transacted to obtain a piece of tangible personal property, not the artist's service).

Taxable Oklahoma imposes sales and use tax on the total gross receipts or sales price of a “bundled transaction.” Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, §1354.35. Oklahoma defines “bundled transaction” as the retail sale of two or more otherwise “distinct and identifiable products” (except real property and services to real property) that are sold for one nonitemized price. A “bundled transaction” does not include the sale of any products in which the sales price varies, or is negotiable, based on the selection by the purchaser of the products included in the transaction. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, §1352(1); Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-1-2. “Distinct and Identifiable Products” For bundled transactions purposes, three types of products are not “distinct and identifiable products.” Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, §1352(1)(a); Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-1-2, Bundled Transaction. These three types of products are:• packaging that accompanies and is incidental or immaterial to the retail sale; Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, §1352(1)(a)(1); Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-1-2, Bundled Transaction. Examples include containers, boxes, sacks, bags, and bottles, or other materials such as wrapping, labels, tags, and instruction guides. Additional examples include grocery sacks, shoeboxes, dry cleaning garment bags and express delivery envelopes and boxes. • products provided free of charge with the required purchase of another product; Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, §1352(1)(b); Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-1-2, Bundled Transaction. A product is provided free of charge if the sales price of the product purchased does not vary depending on the inclusion of the product provided free of charge. and • items included in the definition of “gross receipts” or “sales price.” Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, §1352(1)(c); Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-1-2, Bundled Transaction. “One Nonitemized Price” For bundled transactions purposes, “one nonitemized price” does not include a price that is separately identified by product on binding sales or other supporting sales-related documentation made available to the customer in paper or electronic form. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, §1352(1)(b); Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-1-2, Bundled Transaction. This includes an invoice, bill of sale, receipt, contract, service agreement, lease agreement, periodic notice of rates and services, rate card, or price list. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, §1352(1)(b); Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-1-2, Bundled Transaction; see Oklahoma Commission Decision 2016-08-16-26 (Aug. 16, 2016) (failure to separate taxable and nontaxable charges on an invoice results in the entire charge being taxable). Exceptions Oklahoma does not consider a transaction to be a bundled transaction if the transaction is a:• retail sale of tangible personal property and a service when the tangible personal property is essential to the use of the service, and the tangible personal property is provided exclusively in connection with the service, so long as the true object of the transaction is the service; Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, §1352(1)(b)(1); Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-1-2, Bundled Transaction. • retail sale of services when one service is provided that is essential to the use or receipt of a second service, the first service is provided exclusively in connection with the second service, and the true object of the transaction is the second service; Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, §1352(1)(b)(2); Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-1-2, Bundled Transaction. • transaction that includes taxable products and nontaxable products, and the purchase price or sales price of the taxable products is de minimis, 10 percent or less of the total price of the bundled products; Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, §1352(1)(b)(3); Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-1-2, Bundled Transaction. or • retail sale of exempt tangible personal property and taxable tangible personal property when the transaction includes food and food ingredients, drugs, durable medical equipment, mobility enhancing equipment, over-the-counter drugs, prosthetic devices, or medical supplies, and the vendor's or seller's purchase price or sales price of the taxable tangible personal property is 50 percent or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled tangible personal property. Vendors and sellers may not use a combination of the purchase price and sales price of the tangible personal property when making the 50 percent determination for a transaction. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, §1352(1)(b)(4); Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-1-2, Bundled Transaction. BNA-SUTN OK 9.3.2.
