Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Business Owners, Operators

Yes The New York City sales and use tax; parking surtax; and tax on credit reporting services are collected and administered by the New York State Tax Commission under the same rules and provisions as the state sales and use tax. N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2001(d); N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2001(e); N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2044; N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2052(a). Generally, in New York, a person is under a duty to act if he or she is authorized to sign a corporation's tax returns, is responsible for maintaining the corporate books, or is responsible for the corporation's management. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. and Regs. tit. 20, §526.11(b)(2); In re Pappas, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision Nos. 822124 and 822125 (Dec. 11, 2005), aff'g in part New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination Nos. 822124 and 822125 (Aug. 21, 2014) (finding that an investor who was not involved in a donut franchise's day-to-day operations was a responsible party because he signed the franchise agreement, was listed as the LLC's president, had signature authority over the bank accounts, and had the authority to sign checks or tax returns; but investor was not a responsible party for the entire period at issue because he had been “locked out” of the business); In re Tak Wing Tam, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination Nos. 817213 and 817214 (July 26, 2001), citing In re Constantino, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 802335 (Sept. 27, 1990); see also In re Marchello, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 821443 (April 14, 2011). Indeed, merely holding corporate office does not, per se, impose tax liability on a person. Rather, New York determines whether the person must collect and remit tax on a case-by-case basis. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. and Regs. tit. 20, §526.11(b)(2). The pivotal question is whether the individual has or could have sufficient authority and control over the corporation's affairs. See In re Sidote, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 825772 (Aug. 13, 2015), citing Ianniello v. New York Tax Appeals Trib., 209 A.D.2d 740, 617 N.Y.S.2d 973 (N.Y. App. Div. Nov. 3, 1994). Liability of LLC or Partnership's Members Unlike in the case of a corporate officer, New York imposes per se liability for unpaid sales tax on a limited liability company or partnership's members. In In re Santo, the New York Tax Appeals Tribunal ruled that a member of a restaurant LLC who was in charge of running the day-to-day operations was personally liable for the entity's unpaid sales tax debts. The tribunal found that the member, Joseph Santo, was personally liable for the entity's unpaid sales taxes even though he held a minority interest and delegated responsibility for filing tax return to another member. At the initial hearing, the ALJ ruled that Santo was not personally liable for the sales tax debt because he was a minority investor who lacked the power to exercise tax collection responsibilities on behalf of the LLC. Reversing the ALJ's determination, the tribunal found that as an LLC member, Santo was strictly liable for the LLC's tax debt, and it was an error to treat him as if he were an officer or employee of a corporation. In re Sidote, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 825772 (Aug. 13, 2015). Payment Directly to Tax Commission by Customer If a customer has failed to pay a tax to the person required to collect the tax, then the customer must pay the tax directly to the tax commission. N.Y.
