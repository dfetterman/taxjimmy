Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Sales Tax

Yes Under South Carolina law, a state sales tax is imposed on every person engaged or continuing within the state in the business of making retail sales of tangible personal property and taxable services. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-910(A); S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-910(B). The state sales tax is a levy on retailers for engaging in the business of making retail sales in South Carolina. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-910(A). A retailer may add the state sales tax to the sales price of tangible personal property or taxable services that are sold, and thereby pass the tax on to the consumer. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-940(A). However, a retailer's inability, impracticability, refusal, or failure to add the tax to the sales price and collect the amount from the purchaser does not relieve the retailer from the obligation to pay the sales tax to the state. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-940(B). BNA-SUTN SC 1.1.1.

Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Use Tax

Yes South Carolina law imposes a tax on any tangible personal property purchased at retail for use, storage, or consumption in South Carolina, regardless of whether the retailer is engaged in business in the state. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1310(A); S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1110. With respect to the use tax, the purchaser is liable for the payment of the tax. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1310(A). However, if a purchaser has a receipt from a seller that is required or authorized to collect the state use tax and that receipt shows that the seller has already collected the tax from the purchaser, then the purchaser is relieved of liability for payment of the use tax.

H.B. 5078, effective June 6, 2016 (adding referendum publication requirements). South Carolina authorizes counties and municipalities limited authority to impose local sales and use taxes for different purposes.

The tax applies to the gross proceeds of sales that are subject to the state sales and use tax. S.C. Code Ann. §4-10-20. Most local sales and use taxes provide the same exemptions as the state provides, however, there are some differences. For example, some localities do not exempt sales of certain foods or for food stamp purchases, although the state exempts such sales. The Department of Revenue has issued guidance on the exemptions allowed by each county and municipality, and the Catawba Indian Reservation. The guidance addresses only those local taxes that are administered by the Department, and does not cover taxes collected by the localities. South Carolina Information Letter No. IL 19-16 (Aug. 1, 2019), superseding South Carolina Information Letter No. IL 19-9 (May 1, 2019), superseding South Carolina Information Letter No. IL 19-5 (March 1, 2019).

S.C. Code Ann. §4-10-420(B)(1). Additionally, the Education Capital Improvements Sales and Use Tax may only be imposed in counties which have collected at least $7 million dollars in state accommodations taxes in the most recent fiscal year for which full collection figures are available. Once this threshold is met, a county thereafter remains eligible to impose this tax. S.C. Code Ann. §4-10-470(A). The Education Capital Improvements Sales and Use Tax also may be imposed in a county without regard to the above requirements if, at the time of the referendum, no portion of the county in which tax is to be imposed is subject to more than 2 percent total local sales tax, and the county is encompassed completely by one entire school district, and that school district also extends into one adjacent county. S.C. Code Ann. §4-10-470(B), as added by 2013 S.C. S.B. 940, effective Jan. 24, 2014. Further, the tax may be imposed in a county so long as the county or school district imposed a local sales and use tax to fund education capital improvements on January 1, 2014. S.C.

In addition, the Catawba Indian Tribe imposes a tribal use tax on the storage, use, or other consumption on the Reservation of tangible personal property purchased at retail outside South Carolina when the vendor does not collect the tax. However, use taxes collected by a vendor which is not located in South Carolina are subject to state use taxes, and the use tax must be remitted to the state and not the tribe. Use taxes not collected by the vendor and remitted to the state are subject to the tribal use tax and must be collected directly by the tribe. S.C. Code Ann. §27-16-130(H)(3)(d). Local Option Tourism Development Fee A municipality may impose a fee in an amount not to exceed one percent of the gross proceeds of sales or sales price of all amounts subject to South Carolina's state sales and use tax, for a period of not more than 10 years.

Code Ann. §12-28-710(A)(16). For more information about excise taxes in South Carolina see the Excise Tax Navigator, at South Carolina 1.1. Replacement Taxes South Carolina is not a member state of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement and therefore does not have any prohibition on replacement taxes. South Carolina does not enumerate any replacement taxes in its tax code. Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, as amended through December 16, 2016.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Historical Information

Est. 1951 South Carolina began imposing sales and use tax at 3 percent in 1951 to raise funds for the support of elementary and secondary education. South Carolina Sales and Use Tax Manual, 2019 Edition (April 2019). The tax was increased in 1969 to further support of the public schools. The last major tax increase occurred in 1984. Twenty percent of the sales and use tax is set aside to fund the Education Improvement Act and the remainder is deposited in the general fund to fund the Education Finance Act. South Carolina Sales and Use Tax Manual, 2019 Edition (April 2019). Adoption of the local option sales tax was subject to referendum in 1990. South Carolina Sales and Use Tax Manual, 2019 Edition (April 2019). In 1951, when the sales tax law was first enacted, there were 19 exemptions. By 1991, the number of exemptions had increased to 49, resulting in an eight figure loss in revenue. Currently, there are 82 exemptions, further contributing to steep revenue loss. See S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-2120; South Carolina Sales and Use Tax Manual, 2019 Edition (April 2019). BNA-SUTN SC 1.2.

Click-Through Nexus Click-Through Nexus South Carolina currently does not address click-through nexus. It proposed 2015 S.C. S.B. 170, which would have codified a click-through nexus provision. However, the bill died at the end of the 2015-2016 session after failing to make it out of the House Ways and Means Committee. 2015 S.C. S.B. 170. The bill would have added the following language: (A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a retailer is presumed to be liable for the sales tax or responsible for collecting and remitting the use tax if the retailer enters into an agreement with a resident of this State under which the resident, for a commission or other consideration, directly or indirectly refers potential customers, whether by a link on an internet website or otherwise, to the retailer. (B)The presumption set forth in subsection (A) applies only if the retailer's gross proceeds of sales attributable to purchasers in this State who were referred to the retailer pursuant to such agreements in the aggregate exceed ten thousand dollars in the preceding twelve calendar months. The presumption may be rebutted by proof that the resident with whom the retailer has an agreement did not engage in any solicitation in the State on behalf of the retailer that would satisfy the nexus requirement of the United States Constitution during the twelve calendar months in question. (C) A retailer liable for the sales tax or responsible for collecting and remitting the use tax under the provisions of this section must obtain a retail license and remit sales and use taxes in accordance with the provisions of this chapter on all retail sales of tangible personal property not otherwise exempt. 2015 S.C. S.B. 170. Exemptions The 2015-2016 Session also proposed House Bill 4227, which would have amended Section 12-36-2120 of the sales and use tax code to remove several of the exemptions currently in place, as an effort to boost revenue for South Carolina's education system. This bill also died in committee at the end of the session. 2015 S.C. H.B. 4227. Advisory Opinions In April 2017, the Department of Revenue issued its quarterly Citator of SC Advisory Opinions, which outlines the effect of new advisory opinions on those previously published. The citator addresses Revenue Rulings, Temporary Revenue Rulings, Revenue Procedures, Temporary Revenue Procedures, Private Letter Rulings, Technical Advisement Memoranda, and Information Letters.
