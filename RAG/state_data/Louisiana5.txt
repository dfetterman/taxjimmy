Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Real Property

Nontaxable Real property is not movable property and therefore, is not taxable tangible personal property for sales and use tax purposes. See La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 471; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:302; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:321. Corporeal movable property under the Civil Code constitutes tangible personal property. Louisiana Private Letter Ruling 06-010 (July 24, 2006); New Orleans v. Baumer Foods, Inc., 532 So. 2d 1381 (La. 1988). Additionally, repair services performed on immovable property are not subject to tax. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(14)(g)(ii); Louisiana Sales Tax Revenue Ruling 10-003 (Nov. 10, 2010); Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin 09-036 (Oct. 15, 2009); Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin 04-010 (April 20, 2004). Where a contractor, in the performance of repair or construction services, affixes movable property to immovable property such that it becomes a component part of the immovable property, the contractor is liable for tax on the property so affixed. La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 472; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:302; Louisiana Private Letter Ruling 06-010 (July 24, 2006). Constructions Permanently Attached to the Ground Effective July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2018, Louisiana temporarily imposes sales and use tax at a rate of 2 percent on sales of constructions permanently attached to the ground. From July 1, 2018, through March 31, 2019, the rate decreases to 0 percent. From April 1, 2016, through June 30, 2016, the rate was 4 percent. Before April 1, 2016, those transactions were exempt.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal General Rule for Classification

Three-part Test Under the Louisiana Civil Code, there is a three-part test for determining whether corporeal movable property has been incorporated into real property such that it becomes a component part of the real property. However, an item need only satisfy one of these three components to be considered a component part of immovable property. See La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 466. Under the first component of the test, otherwise corporeal movable property becomes immovable property (real property) if it is attached to a building such that according to current prevailing usages considering the building's general type, it serves to enhance the building's utility. La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 466; see Hitachi Med. Sys. Am., Inc. v. Bridges, 2015 BL 403620 (La. Ct. App. 2015) (repairs to MRI machines were taxable repairs to corporeal movable property (i.e., tangible personal property)). Examples of such property include doors, shutters, gutters, cabinetry, plumbing, heating, cooling, and electrical systems. In applying this test, the specific use of a building is not to be considered. For instance, an MRI machine attached to a hospital building would not qualify as a component part of the building under this test, because it would not enhance the utility of the building generally, but only with reference to the specific activities conducted within the building. On the other hand, a lighting fixture attached to the interior of the same building would constitute immovable property under this test, because the fixture would serve to enhance the building's general utility as a commercial building, regardless of the particular use made of the building. La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 466; see Hitachi Med. Sys. Am., Inc. v. Bridges, 2015 BL 403620 (La. Ct. App. 2015) (repairs to MRI machines were taxable repairs to corporeal movable property (i.e., tangible personal property)). Under the second component of the test, corporeal movable property becomes a component part of immovable property (real property) if it is attached to a construction permanently attached to land, other than a building, in such a manner that it serves the principal use of the construction. La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 466; La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 508; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(16)(l); Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin 04-010 (April 20, 2004). Under this test, unlike the first test, the principal use of the construction is considered. If otherwise movable property is attached to an immovable construction such that it furthers that construction's principal use, the attached property becomes a component part of the immovable property. For example, valves, piping, and access ladders attached to a water tower would further its use as a water tower and, therefore, would constitute component parts of the tower. However, a mobile phone antenna attached to the top of a water tower but unrelated to the operation of the tower would not further the principal use of the water tower and thus would not qualify as immovable property under this test. La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 466. Under the third component of the test, otherwise movable property becomes immovable property(real property) if it is attached to a building or other immovable construction to such an extent that it cannot be removed without substantial damage to itself or to the building or other construction to which it is attached. La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 466. To determine whether an item is an “other construction permanently attached to the ground”, Louisiana employs a separate three—part test. Under this test, Louisiana considers the following three factors: (1) the size of the item; (2)the degree of the item's integration or attachment to the soil; and(3) the item's permanency. See Louisiana Board of Tax Appeals Decision No. L00315 (Jan. 9, 2019) (finding that petroleum storage tanks were immovable property by reason of their being “other constructions permanently attached to the ground”).

Depends The taxability of charges for the sale and installation of appliances, electronics, machinery, and equipment depends on whether those items are considered immovable property (real property) once installed.

Machinery & Equipment Louisiana does not specifically address whether machinery and equipment retain their character as tangible personal property or become incorporated into immovable property (real property)upon installation. See La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301, et seq. To determine the taxability of charges for the sale and installation of machinery and equipment, the three-part test under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 466 must be used. La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 466; see Hitachi Med. Sys. Am., Inc. v. Bridges, 2015 BL 403620 (La. Ct. App. 2015) (repairs to MRI machines were taxable repairs to corporeal movable property (i.e., tangible personal property)).

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Construction Materials and Contracts Construction Materials and Contracts, Generally

Nontaxable Louisiana requires a construction contractor to pay sales and use tax on construction materials that it purchases to perform a construction contract. See La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 472 (stating that building materials constitute “movables” until their incorporation into a new building or other construction.); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:302; Louisiana Private Letter Ruling 06-010 (July 24, 2006). A rebuttable presumption exists that sales of tangible personal property to a contractor for use in the construction, repair, or alteration of “immovable property"are not sales for resale, making the contractor liable for sales and use tax. This presumption may be rebutted by credible evidence showing that title or possession of the tangible personal property was transferred to the contractor's customer before becoming part of the immovable property. La. Admin. Code tit. 61, § 4372(C); Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin 12-028 (Aug. 20, 2012). Since the 1970s, Louisiana has statutorily prohibited any new or additional sales or use tax on materials or services involved in a lump sum or unit price construction contract entered into and reduced to writing before the statute or ordinance's effective date or within 90 days thereafter, if the contract involves obligations undertaken before the effective date and was computed and bid for based on the pre-effective date rate. Beginning July 1, 2017, this was expanded to include fixed-fee construction contracts and guaranteed maximum price construction contracts as well. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:305.11, as amended by 2017 La. H.B. 264, effective July 14, 2017; Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin No. 16-016 (April 19, 2016).
