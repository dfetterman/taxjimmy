Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Motor Vehicles, Intrastate or Non-Commercial Use Purchase, Lease, or Rental Transactions

Taxable The sale or use of motor vehicles, trailers, and other types of vehicles is generally subject to sales and use tax. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.25.1(1). See generally Massachusetts Guide to Motor Vehicle Sales and Use Tax. “Sales price”of a motor vehicle means the total amount or value paid or exchanged by a purchaser as consideration for the transfer of title to or possession of a motor vehicle, trailer, or other vehicle, whether valued in money or otherwise, less any vehicle manufacturer's excise tax imposed by the United States. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 64H, §1; Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.25.1(1); Massachusetts Directive 14-1 (March 19, 2014); see also Massachusetts Directive 12-6 (Oct. 16, 2012) (parking violation surcharge on motor vehicle leases and rentals subject to sales tax because it is included in vehicle's sales price). Motor vehicle is defined as “a motorized, self-propelled vehicle which is constructed and designed for transportation or travel over a land surface; but not including mopeds, motorized bicycles, or vehicles incapable of speeds in excess of 12 miles per hour which are used other than for transporting persons or property, and are either used exclusively for highway building, repair, or maintenance, or are especially designed for use other than on public highways.” Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.25.1(2). Separately stated document preparation fees and title preparation fees charged by a motor vehicle dealer in connection with the sale of a motor vehicle are part of the sales price subject to sales tax, regardless of whether they are paid at the time of the sale or finance. Massachusetts Directive 14-1 (March 19, 2014) (these are not optional services; thus, whether or not separately stated, any charges from a dealer for document preparation fees and title preparation fees are services that are a part of the sale and, as such, are included in the sales price subject to tax). When a motor vehicle has been purchased in a private sale from a nonregistered vendor, the value used to determine the amount of use tax on a motor vehicle will be the greater of the amount paid for the vehicle or the clean trade-in value listed by the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA)or a comparable resource, regardless of the actual condition of the vehicle. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 64H, §4; Massachusetts Administrative Decision C31180 (Jan. 14, 2013); Massachusetts Guide to Motor Vehicle Sales and Use Tax (clean trade-in value is adjusted for high or low mileage, but not the mechanical or structural condition of the vehicle). Leases The lease or rental of a motor vehicle (or trailer or other vehicle) by a lessor in the regular course of business is a sale at retail and is subject to the sales tax. Each period for which a lease or rental payment is charged is considered a retail sale for the purpose of the imposition, collection, and payment of tax. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.25.1(9); Massachusetts Directive 04-3 (May 3, 2004). The sales price on which the tax is computed for each period is the total lease or rental charges for that period, subject to the following rules:• If a motor vehicle (or trailer or other vehicle) is leased or rented for a period of at least one year or more, and if the amount charged includes separately stated charges for insurance, fuel, motor vehicle excise fees, or registration fees, such separately stated charges are not included in the calculation of sales tax. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.25.1(9)(a)(1). • If a motor vehicle is leased or rented for a period of at least one year or more, and if the amount charged includes charges for insurance, motor vehicle excise tax, and registration fees that are not separately stated, the sales price on which the tax is computed for each period is reduced by 20 percent. This does not apply to finance leasing arrangements. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.25.1(9)(a)(2). • If a motor vehicle is leased or rented for at least one year or more, and if the amount charged includes charges for fuel, insurance, motor vehicle excise tax, and registration fee that are not separately stated, the sales price on which the tax is computed for each period is reduced by 30 percent. This does not apply to finance leasing arrangements. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.25.1(9)(a)(3). Exemptions Massachusetts enumerates several exemptions related to the sale or transfer of motor vehicles:• Disabled Persons - Sales of motor vehicles for noncommercial purposes to and for the use of a person who has suffered the loss or permanent loss of (1) both legs, (2) both arms, or (3) one leg or one arm; Mass. Gen. L. ch. 64H, §6(u); Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.25.1(7)(f). • Disabled Veterans - Sales of motor vehicles to a permanently disabled veteran for noncommercial purposes. The medical advisory board must determine if the veteran is permanently disabled; Mass. Gen. L. ch. 64H, §6(u); Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 06-18 (Oct. 10, 2006). • Fire Engines - Sales of fire engines to volunteer nonprofit organizations providing public fire protection; and Mass. Gen. L. ch. 64H, §6(x); Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.25.1(7)(i). • Intra-Family Transfers - Casual and isolated sales or transfers of motor vehicles or trailers to parents, spouses, children, brothers or sisters of the seller or transferor. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.25.1(7)(e). • Business Entity Transfers - Sales of motor vehicles where the transferor has previously paid sales or use tax and the sale or transfer qualifies as a reorganization; in exchange for an ownership interest in the formation of a partnership, corporate trust, or organizing a corporation;or in exchange for an ownership interest in closing or liquidating a partnership, corporate trust, or a corporation. Massachusetts Guide to Motor Vehicle Sales and Use Tax. Motor Vehicles Purchased Out-of-State Massachusetts has a rebuttable presumption that unless a vehicle is used exclusively outside of Massachusetts for a period of 6 months before the date it is first delivered, brought into, or used in Massachusetts, the vehicle is presumed to be sold or transferred within Massachusetts. A vehicle which is used exclusively outside of Massachusetts for a period of at least 6 months before it is delivered, brought into, or used in Massachusetts is subject to the use tax if the purchaser/transferee intended to store or use the vehicle in Massachusetts at the time of the purchase/transfer. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 64I, §8(f); Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.25.1(3)(c)(2); see Regency Transp., Inc. v. Massachusetts Comr. of Rev., 2016 BL 970 (Mass. 2016)(imposition of unapportioned use tax on interstate fleet of vehicles used both within and outside of Massachusetts does not violate the commerce clause of the United States Constitution). The sale or transfer of a motor vehicle, trailer, or other vehicle in any state or territory within the United States that is subsequently brought to or used in Massachusetts is exempt from Massachusetts use tax if the following requirements are met:• the purchaser or the transferee must have paid a sales or use tax on the vehicle to the state or territory in which the sale or transfer occurred; • the sales or use tax must have been paid by the purchaser or the transferee and legally due the state or territory; • the purchaser or the transferee must not have received and must not have a right to receive a refund or credit of the sales or use tax from the state or territory in which the sale or transfer occurred; and • the state or territory to which the sales or use tax was paid must allow a corresponding exemption with respect to motor vehicle sales and use taxes paid to Massachusetts. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.25.1(7)(g). In addition, the sale or transfer of a motor vehicle, trailer, or other vehicle in any state or territory within the United States that is subsequently brought to or used in Massachusetts for purposes of interstate commerce, is exempt from Massachusetts use tax so long as the tax:• is applied to an activity that has a substantial nexus with Massachusetts; • is fairly apportioned; • does not discriminate against interstate commerce; and • is fairly related to the services provided by the taxing authority. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.25.1(7)(h); Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U.S. 274 (1977). Rescissions Buyers may request a refund of sales or use tax if they return a motor vehicle with 180 days from the date of sale and receive the full consideration paid, less the pre-established handling fees. Buyers must submit an abatement, Form MV-AB2, and a copy of the registration showing the tax paid. Massachusetts Guide to Motor Vehicle Sales and Use Tax (noting that ‘lemon law' refunds from manufacturers do not count as a rescission). BNA-SUTN MA 29.3.1.

Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Motor Vehicles, Intrastate or Non-Commercial Use Repair Services

Nontaxable Repair services to motor vehicles are not subject to tax. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.1.1(5)(a). However, anyone who provides motor vehicle repair services must collect tax on any materials that it furnishes in connection with repair work, where the value of the parts or materials is more than inconsequential (more than 10 percent of the charge). Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.1.1(5)(a). If the value of the property used in repair work is inconsequential and the repairer makes no separate charge for such property, the repair service enterprise is the consumer and pays the sales tax when it purchases the property. The repairer does not collect a tax from the customer. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.1.1(5)(a). A repairer of a motor vehicle who does not separate on its customer invoices or in its records, the fair retail selling price of the parts or materials from the charge for labor, installation, or other services, will face the presumption that the entire charge represents the sales price of the property.
