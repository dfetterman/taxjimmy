Effective May 23, 2019, the following items are also exempt when sold for use on any of the above-listed exempt machinery:• traction enhancement accessories; • tire chains; • track systems; and • winch cables. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, §9741(51), as amended by 2017 Vt. H. 495, effective July 1, 2017, and by 2019 Vt. H. 82, effective May 23, 2019. Hand tools, such as chainsaws, do not qualify for the exemption. Further, purchases of machinery and equipment not listed above remain taxable, regardless of whether such items are used in logging or forestry. Such taxable purchases include bulldozers, excavators, ATVs, and tractors. Vermont Tax Fact Sheet FS-1142. However, there is a cap on the amount of sales tax that can be charged on the purchase of tracked vehicles, including bulldozers and excavators. The cap amount is currently $1380 for the state sales tax, and $230 for the local option sales tax. This cap is equivalent to the sales tax on the first $23,000 of the sales price of the tracked vehicle. Amounts over $23,000 are not taxed. Vermont Tax Fact Sheet FS-1142; see also Vermont Technical Bulletin TB-52. Prior to July 1, 2017, sales of all such items are taxable. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, §9741.

The cutting of trees, except for cutting Christmas trees, is also not considered to be an agricultural activity. Vt. Code R. §1.9741(25)-2(A). Dyed diesel (commonly referred to as “off-road dyed diesel”) used in exempt timber machinery is exempt from sales tax. If dyed diesel is used in other types of machinery, it is exempt if it is used to make the machinery move. Vermont Tax Fact Sheet FS-1142. BNA-SUTN VT 30.3.3.

Topic: Utilities, Fuel, Mining and Natural Resource Extraction, Production, Sale Energy Production

Exempt Machinery and equipment used directly in the production of electricity for sale qualifies for Vermont's manufacturing exemption. See Vermont Formal Ruling No. 2012-05 (July 30, 2012). Battery systems which store energy captured by solar cells are not directly used in the production of electricity and are therefore not exempt from sales tax. Vermont Formal Ruling No. 18-04 (May 22, 2018) (storage is not part of the manufacturing process). While concrete foundations may be essential to the construction of wind turbine generators, the foundations are not used directly and exclusively to convert wind into electric energy. In addition, the construction phase occurs prior and is unrelated to the production stage, thus making the foundations ineligible for a machinery and equipment exemption. The parties stated intention not to remove the foundations at the end of their useful life, but instead to destroy and remove a portion of each, demonstrates that the parties intend for the foundations to be a permanent accession to the real estate. The concrete foundations are improvements to real property making the concrete supplies used to build the foundations subject to tax. See Vermont Formal Ruling No. 2012-05 (July 30, 2012).

Ann. tit. 32, §9741(46); Vermont Tax Fact Sheet FS-1182. Vermont's exemption for solar energy water heating systems is limited to that property directly necessary for and used to capture, convert, or store solar energy for the purpose of converting it into thermal energy used to heat water. The parts of a system that are unrelated to solar energy, such as water pumps and pipes, are subject to sales tax. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, §9741(46); Vermont Tax Fact Sheet FS-1182. Advanced Wood Boilers Effective July 1, 2018, to July 1, 2023, sales of advanced wood boilers are exempt from sales and use tax. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, §9741(52), as amended by 2017 Vt.
