Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Tangible Personal Property

Destination Under Minnesota law, the sourcing rules relating to state sales and use tax generally apply regardless of the characterization of a product as tangible personal property, a digital good, or a service. Minn. Stat. §297A.668(1). However, the following rules do not apply to telecommunications services or the sales of motor vehicles. Minn. Stat. §297A.668(1); see also Minnesota Basic Sales and Use Tax Manual. The retail sale, excluding lease or rental, of a product is sourced as follows:• if a purchaser receives the product at a seller's business location, the sale is sourced to that business location; • if a purchaser does not receive the product at a seller's business location, the sale is sourced to the location where the purchaser receives the product; • if the location of a sale cannot be determined under the above rules, the sale is sourced to the purchaser's address as indicated by the seller's business records; • if the location of a sale cannot be sourced under any of the above rules, the sale is sourced to the purchaser's address as obtained during the consummation of the sale, such as the address indicated on the purchaser's payment instrument; and • if the location of a sale cannot be sourced under any of the above rules, the sale is sourced as follows: ○ if tangible personal property or other taxable property is sold, the sale of such property is sourced to the location from which the property is shipped; ○ if a digital good or computer software electronically delivered is sold, the sale is sourced to the location from which the digital good or computer software was first available for transmission by the seller; and ○ if a service is sold, the sale is sourced to the location from which the service was provided. Minn. Stat. §297A.668(2). Digital Products Delivers to Multiple Points of Use Effective July 1, 2013, a purchaser of digital products or computer software delivered electronically may source the sale to multiple locations if the purchaser knows at the time of purchase that these items will be used concurrently in more than one taxing jurisdiction. For purposes of this exemption, “concurrently available for use” means that employees or other agents of the buyer may use the digital products or computer software delivered electronically, simultaneously from one or more locations within the state and one or more locations outside the state. A digital code is concurrently available for use within and outside the state if employees or other agents of the buyer may use the digital products to be obtained by the code simultaneously at one or more locations within the state and one or more locations outside the state. Minnesota Tax Fact Sheet 134. The purchaser is responsible for apportioning and remitting the tax due to each taxing jurisdiction. The apportionment method can be based on any reasonable method, as long as it is applied in a consistent and uniform manner, and the method can be justified through supporting records. Minnesota Tax Fact Sheet 134. Items Delivered Outside of Minnesota Sales tax is not applied to items delivered out of state, regardless of who arranges delivery. But if the purchaser takes possession of the goods in Minnesota, the sale is subject to Minnesota tax. Minnesota Tax Fact Sheet 110.
