Nontaxable Sales and use tax is not imposed on real property. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.020; Mo. Rev. Stat. §137.100. Real property is defined as land and items permanently affixed to land, such as buildings. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-112.010(2)(C). BNA-SUTN MO 28.1.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal General Rule for Classification

Three-part Test Tangible personal property that has become a fixture prior to the passage of title is not subject to tax. Marsh v. Spradling, 537 S.W.2d 402 (Mo. 1976). To determine whether an item becomes a fixture to real property, Missouri considers the following: the item's annexation to land; its adaptation to the location; and (3) the intent of the annexor at the time of annexation. Buchholz Mortuaries Inc. v. Missouri Dir. of Rev., 113 S.W.3d 192 (Mo. 2003); Marsh v. Spradling, 537 S.W.2d 402 (Mo. 1976). Installed carpet and flooring was considered a fixture in Missouri Administrative Decision 94-001493RV. The fact that the landowner might later make alterations to the property or sever the fixture did not negate the prior passage of title or the conclusion that the annexation is indeed part of the land. Missouri Administrative Decision 94-001493RV (Feb. 27, 1996). BNA-SUTN MO 28.2.1.

Depends Missouri does not treat the sale and installation of appliances, electronics, machinery, and equipment per se as a taxable sale and installation of tangible personal property. See Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.010, et seq. Instead, the characterization of the sale and installation of these items is determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, applying Missouri's three-part test. See, e.g., Buchholz Mortuaries Inc. v. Missouri Dir. of Rev., 113 S.W.3d 192 (Mo. 2003); Marsh v. Spradling, 537 S.W.2d 402 (Mo. 1976). BNA-SUTN MO 28.2.2.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Construction Materials and Contracts Construction Materials and Contracts, Generally

Nontaxable Charges for construction labor billed to a contractee are not subject to sales and use tax in Missouri. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-103.600(1). In general, a contractor is the final user and consumer of materials and supplies used in fulfilling a construction contract, when such materials become part of a completed real property improvement. Therefore, vendors selling materials to a contractor are generally subject to tax on the gross receipts of such sales, because the purchase is not for resale as tangible personal property. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-112.010(1); see Sports Unltd. Inc. v. Missouri Dir. of Rev., 962 S.W.2d 885 (Mo. 1998); Missouri ex rel. Mo. State Highway Comm'n v. Hensel Phelps Constr. Co., 634 S.W.2d 168 (Mo. 1982)(en banc); Missouri Letter Ruling LR7224 (Feb. 28, 2013); Missouri Letter Ruling LR7115 (July 20, 2012); Missouri Letter Ruling LR5820 (Aug. 7, 2009); Missouri Letter Ruling LR5824 (Aug. 7, 2009); Missouri Letter Ruling LR5692 (June 2, 2009). However, if title passes from the contractor to the contractee before attachment of the materials to real property, the contractor is responsible for collecting and remitting tax on the gross receipts from the sale of the materials to its contractee, and may purchase the materials exempt from tax under Missouri's sale-for-resale exemption. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-112.010(3)(A); Missouri Letter Ruling LR7224 (Feb. 28, 2013). Generally, title passes after installation is complete, unless the contractor and purchaser expressly agree otherwise. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-112.010(3)(A). If a seller of construction materials accepts a resale exemption certificate in good faith from a contractor, the seller is not responsible for sales tax if the contractor later takes the materials out of its stock and uses it in making real property improvements. Missouri Letter Ruling LR7809 (April 13, 2017). A “contractor” is any person entering into an agreement to improve, repair, replace, erect, or alter real property. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-112.010(2)(A); see Missouri Letter Ruling LR7863 (Aug. 11, 2017). Certain exemptions that are based on the ultimate owner's use of an item (e.g., the manufacturing exemption)may flow through to the contractor selling and installing the item. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-112.010(3)(C). But see Alberici Constructors Inc. v. Missouri Dir. of Rev., No. 10-1765 RS (Mo. Admin. Hearing Comn. Oct. 10, 2013) (a contractor's rentals of cranes and a welder used to construct exempt manufacturing facilities were not “materials” eligible for Missouri's exemption for materials used to construct exempt manufacturing facilities). Also, a contractor that is constructing, repairing, or remodeling facilities for a specifically exempt entity may purchase tax exempt tangible personal property if the property is incorporated or consumed in the project. In both cases, the contractor must furnish an exemption certificate to claim these exemptions. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-112.010(3)(D). But see Fenix Construction Co. of St. Louis v. Mo. Dept. of Rev., No. 11-2454 RS (Mo. Admin. Hearing Comn. Jan. 15, 2014) (sales of concrete and steel to a general contractor for use in the construction of tilt-up wall panels are not entitled to sales tax exemption because tilt-up wall panels are not “products” under §144.054.02). A company should accrue tax on the original purchase cost of items taken out of inventory to be consumed in the fulfillment of its construction contracts. The company need not self-accrue tax on materials consumed in construction contracts if the exempt entity issues a project exemption certificate. If the contract is for an out-of-state project and the out-of-state entity is authorized to issue a certificate of exemption for purchases to a contractor under the provisions of that state's laws, then the company may accept an exemption certificate and not self-accrue tax. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-112.010(4)(C). More information on the taxation of construction contractors is available at 1840 T.M., State Taxation of Construction Contractors.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Contracts with Exempt Entities

Depends Purchases of construction materials by contractors for the purpose of constructing, repairing, or remodeling facilities of certain exempt entities are exempt from tax. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.062(2); Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-112.010(3)(D). Exempt entities to which this exemption applies are limited to:• political subdivisions of Missouri that are exempt under Mo. Const. art III, §39(10); • the federal government, including its instrumentalities; • religious organizations; • elementary and secondary schools; • higher education institutions; • the Missouri Department of Transportation; • the Jackson County Sports Complex Authority; and • the Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.062(2); Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-112.010(3)(D); see also Missouri Form 5060. To claim this exemption, contractors must obtain an exemption certificate from the exempt entity. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.062.2; Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-112.010(3)(E). The project exemption certificate must include at least the following information:• the entity's name and address; • the entity's Missouri tax identification number; • the signature of an authorized representative of the entity; • the project location, description, and unique identification number; • the date the contract is entered into; • the estimated project completion date; and • the certificate expiration date. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.062.2; Missouri Letter Ruling LR7791 (May 5, 2017). Without a properly completed project exemption certificate issued by the exempt entity, the contractor must pay sales or use tax on all purchases of taxable materials and services used in completing the project, unless another exemption applies. Missouri Letter Ruling LR7791 (May 5, 2017) (project exemption certificate invalid because exempt federal agency did not have an authorized representative who could legally sign it). To qualify for exemption, the construction materials must be consumed during or incorporated into the project for which the exemption is claimed. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-112.010(3)(D); see Missouri Letter Ruling LR7355 (Jan. 10, 2013) (purchases of lumber that is used as a shoring and support device to pour concrete for an exempt entity project and that is discarded after use in the project is exempt because it is “consumed in the construction of the project.” However, the contractor's exemption only extends to transactions for tangible personal property to be incorporated into the project. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.062(2); Missouri Letter Ruling LR7317 (Oct. 2, 2013). A project exemption certificate may only be furnished by the exempt entity for which the project is being completed.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Mobile and Manufactured Homes

Depends Sales of new manufactured homes are subject to tax on 60 percent of the purchase price. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.044(3); Missouri Motor Vehicle and Marinecraft Titling Manual. The transfer of a manufactured home is not subject to tax because it is not considered a sale at retail except for the following situations:• the transfer involves the delivery of a “manufacturer's statement of origin” to a person other than a manufactured home dealer for purposes of allowing them to obtain a title to the manufactured home from the Missouri Department of Revenue or the appropriate agency of any other state; • the transfer involves the delivery of a “repossessed title” to a resident of Missouri if the sales tax was not paid on the transfer described above; or • the first transfer occurring after Dec. 31, 1985 when the sales tax was not paid on any transfer of the manufactured home occurring before Dec. 31, 1985. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.011.1(12); see Benton Homes Inc. v. Missouri Dir. of Rev., No. 91-001306RV (Mo. Admin. Hearing Comn. April 6, 1992). When the transfer is considered taxable, and the manufactured home is new, 60 percent of the purchase price shall be considered the retail sale of tangible personal property. The remaining 40 percent is considered the sale of a service and is not taxable. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.044(3). The sale of a used manufactured home is exempt from state and local sales and use tax. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.044(4), as amended by 2015 Mo. H.B. 111 effective Aug. 28, 2015; Missouri Motor Vehicle and Marinecraft Titling Manual. The “sale of a used manufactured home” means any subsequent sale of a manufactured home, which does not qualify as new under Mo. Rev. Stat. §700.010(9). Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.044.1(3), as amended by 2015 Mo. H.B. 111, effective Aug. 28, 2015. BNA-SUTN MO 28.8.
