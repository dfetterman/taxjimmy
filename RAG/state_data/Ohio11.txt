Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Local Option Sales and Use Tax

Local Tax Authorized In addition to the state sales and use tax, Ohio authorizes counties to levy two additional sales taxes: a sales tax for general revenue purposes and a sales tax for specifically authorized purposes. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.021(A). County Sales and Use Tax Both apply to every retail sale made within the county, except for watercraft, outboard motor, and motor vehicle sales. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.021(A); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.026(A). These county sales and use taxes are in addition to any applicable sales and use taxes imposed by Ohio. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.021(E); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.026(F); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.021(B); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.023(B). Additionally, Ohio permits any transit authority to levy a sales tax upon retail sales made and a use tax upon any use, consumption, or storage of tangible personal property within the territory of the transit authority, to be imposed in addition to any other applicable state or county sales and use tax. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.023(A); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.022(A);Ohio Dept. of Taxn., The Finder: Sales and Use Tax. Ohio law mandates that any county levying a county sales tax must also impose a use tax at an equivalent rate on the storage, use, or other consumption of tangible personal property or services within the county. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.021(A); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.021(B). The general revenue sales tax is a county tax for the purpose of providing additional general revenue for the county or supporting criminal or administrative justice services in the county, or both. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.021(A). This tax may be imposed at a rate of up to one percent, limited to 0.1 or 0.25 percent increments. Effective Oct. 1, 2019, the rate must be a multiple of 0.05 percent, up to one percent. However, counties other than those that adopted a charter under Art. X, sec. 3 of the Ohio Constitution may impose the tax up to 1.5 percent, with the amount over one percent going towards the construction or repair of a detention facility. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.021(A), amended by 2017 Ohio H.B. 49, effective Sept. 29, 2017,2017 Ohio H.B. 69, effective March 23, 2018, and 2019 Ohio H.B. 166, effective Oct. 1, 2019; see also Ohio Tax Alert: Use Tax Rate Code Reporting Change. The specific purposes tax is a tax levied to fund specific purposes, which include:• to provide additional revenues for the payment of bonds or notes issued in anticipation of bonds issued by a convention facilities authority and to provide additional operating revenues for the convention facilities authority; • to provide additional revenues for a transit authority operating within the county; • to provide additional revenue for the county's general fund; • to provide additional revenue for permanent improvements within the county; • to provide additional revenue for the acquisition, construction, equipping, or repair of any specific permanent improvement or any class or group of permanent improvements. Such improvements must be enumerated in the resolution required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.026(D). These funds must be used to pay principal, interest, premium, and other costs associated with the issuance of bonds or notes in anticipation of bonds issued pursuant to Chapter 133 of the Revised Code for the acquisition, construction, equipping, or repair of the specific permanent improvement or class or group of permanent improvements; • to provide revenue for the implementation and operation of a 9-1-1 system in the county. If the tax is levied or the rate increased exclusively for such purpose, the tax must not be levied or the rate increased for more than five years. At the end of the last year, any balance remaining must remain in that special fund and be used exclusively for the purpose of implementing and operating the 9-1-1 system within the county until the fund is completely expended. The board of county commissioners may not petition for the transfer of money from the fund, and the tax commissioner is not permitted to approve such a petition; • to provide additional revenue for the operation or maintenance of a detention facility; • to provide revenue to finance the construction or renovation of a sports facility, but only if the tax is levied for that purpose in the manner prescribed by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.028: ○ where “sports facility” is defined as a facility intended to house major league professional athletic teams; and ○ where “constructing”or “construction” includes providing fixtures, furnishings, and equipment; • to provide additional revenue for the acquisition of agricultural easements, to pay principal, interest, and premium on bonds issued; and for the supervision and enforcement of agricultural easements held by the county; and • to provide revenue for the provision of ambulance, paramedic, or other emergency medical services. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.026(A). If the tax is levied or the rate increased for such purpose for more than five years, the board of county commissioners also shall levy the tax or increase the rate of the tax for one or more of the purposes described in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.026(A)(1)to (5) and shall prescribe the method for allocating the revenues from the tax each year in the manner required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.026(C). This additional county tax may be imposed either at a rate of 0.25 percent or 0.5 percent. Effective Oct. 1, 2019, it must be imposed at a rate of 0.05 percent Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.026(A), as amended by 2019 Ohio H.B. 166, effective Oct. 1, 2019. Thus, the total sales and use tax rate in any given county comprises the state sales and use tax rate plus any additional elective county sales and use tax imposed within the county. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.021(E); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.026(F). County sales and use taxes enacted or increased by emergency measure may be repealed by initiative petition. County sales taxes that were not enacted by emergency measure may not be repealed by initiative petition, although an initiative petition may be filed to block the tax from being enacted prior to its effective date. State ex rel. Repeal Lorain Cty. Permissive Sales Tax Comm. v. Lorain Cty. Bd. of Elections, 2017 BL 325959 (Ohio 2017). The Ohio Department of Taxation publishes quarterly rate tables by county and by municipality. See, e.g., Ohio Dept. of Taxn., Rates Listed by County and Transit Authority (showing rates listed by county for third quarter 2016); Ohio Dept. of Taxn., Rates Listed by City or Village and Zip Code (showing rates listed by municipality for third quarter 2016). Transit Authority In addition to the state and both general and specific purpose county sales and use taxes, Ohio authorizes any transit authority to levy an additional sales tax upon every retail sale made within the transit authority borders, except for watercraft, outboard motor, and motor vehicle sales. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.023(A); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.023(E). Similarly, transit authorities are authorized to impose an additional use tax on any use, consumption, or storage of tangible personal property within the territory of the transit authority or services provided from another transit authority to the transit authority imposing the use tax. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.022(A); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.022(A). The rate of the tax must be the same for both the sales and use taxes and may be imposed up to 1.5 percent in 0.1 or 0.25 percent increments. Effective Oct. 1, 2019, the tax may be imposed in increments of 0.05 percent and shall not exceed 1.5 percent minus the amount levied under the county sales tax. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.023(A), as amended by 2017 Ohio H.B. 69, effective March 23, 2018, and by 2019 Ohio H.B. 166, effective Oct. 1, 2019. BNA-SUTN OH 1.1.3.

Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Excise and Replacement Taxes

No Ohio does not impose a replacement tax. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.02. Replacement Taxes The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement prohibits member states from imposing a “prohibited replacement tax” which is a tax outside of the sales and use tax that is imposed on products defined in the Agreement. Generally, the Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board will make a finding regarding whether or not a member state has imposed a replacement tax. Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, as amended through Dec. 14, 2018, Section 334; Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board Rules and Procedures, as amended through May 3, 2018, Rule 334.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Pending and Trending Developments

Nexus Effective Jan. 1, 2018, Ohio imposes nexus on certain out-of-state retailers that use in-state software. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.01(I)(2), as amended by 2017 Ohio H.B. 49, effective June 30, 2017; Ohio Information Release ST 2017-02; Ohio Information Release ST 2001-01. Specifically, Ohio presumes that a retailer has substantial nexus with Ohio when a seller:• uses in-state software to sell or lease taxable tangible personal property or services to consumers, provided the seller has gross receipts in excess of $500,000 in the current or preceding calendar year from the sale of tangible personal property for storage, use, or consumption in Ohio, or from providing services where the benefit is realized in Ohio; or • provides or enters into an agreement with another person to provide a content distribution network in Ohio to accelerate or enhance the delivery of the seller's website to consumers, provided the seller has gross receipts in excess of $500,000 in the current or preceding calendar year from the sale of tangible personal property for storage, use, or consumption in Ohio or from providing services where the benefit is realized in Ohio. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.01(I)(2), as amended by 2017 Ohio H.B. 49, effective June 30, 2017; Ohio Information Release ST 2017-02; Ohio Information Release ST 2001-01. On Dec. 29, 2017, the American Catalog Mailers Association brought suit challenging the statute imposing this “cookie” nexus. The suit is still ongoing. American Catalog Mailers Assn. v. Testa, Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Case No. 17 CV 01140. The case was voluntarily dismissed at the request of the Association on Dec. 18, 2018. American Catalog Mailers Assn. v. Testa, No. 17-CV-11440 (Ohio Ct. Com. Pl. Dec. 18, 2018). On June 21, 2018, the Supreme Court released an opinion in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. overruling the physical presence standards of Quill Corp. v. North Dakota and Natl. Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev. To date, the Ohio Department of Taxation has not issued guidance addressing whether the decision in Wayfair will effect how it imposes nexus on out-of-state retailers. Whether Ohio will seek to take more aggressive action regarding the imposition of nexus on out-of-state retailers in the post-Wayfair world remains an open question. South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., 138 S. Ct. 2080, 2018 BL 219995 (U.S. 2018); Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 298 (1992), overruled in part by South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., 138 S. Ct. 2080, 2018 BL 219995 (U.S. 2018); Natl. Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 386 U.S. 753 (1967), overruled by South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., 138 S. Ct. 2080, 2018 BL 219995 (U.S. 2018). Click-Through Nexus Ohio has passed legislation imposing “click-through” nexus on out-of-state retailers. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.01(I)(2)(g), as amended by 2015 Ohio H.B. 64, effective July 1, 2015. Effective July 1, 2015, Ohio has created a rebuttable presumption of substantial nexus when a seller enters into an agreement with one or more residents of the state under which the resident, for a commission or other consideration, directly or indirectly refers potential customers to the seller, whether by a link on a website, an in-person oral presentation, telemarketing, or otherwise. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.01(I)(2)(g), as amended by 2015 Ohio H.B. 64, effective July 1, 2015; Bloomberg Tax Survey of State Tax Departments. For this presumption to apply, the cumulative gross receipts from sales to consumers referred to the seller by all such residents must have exceeded $12,000 during the preceding 12 months. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.01(I)(2)(g), as amended by 2015 Ohio H.B. 64, effective July 1, 2015. For more information regarding Ohio's nexus standards, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Ohio 3.1.2. Effective March 19, 2017, a Tax Expenditure Review Committee is created to review existing tax expenditures, and make recommendations regarding whether the expenditure should remain unchanged, undergo modification, be considered for repeal, or outright repealed. Ohio defines “tax expenditure” to mean any tax provision that exempts, either in whole or in part, certain persons, income, goods, services, or property from the effect of taxes, including, but not limited to, tax deductions, exemptions, deferrals, exclusions, allowances, credits, reimbursements, and preferential tax rates. 2015 Ohio H.B. 9, effective March 19, 2016; Ohio Rev.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Sale' and 'Retail Sale'

Defined “Sale”includes absolute or conditional transactions made for consideration in any manner, whether for a price or rental, in money or by an exchange, to accomplish the transfer of title or possession, or both, of tangible personal property, or a license to use or consume tangible personal property is or is to be transferred. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.01(B)(1); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.01(B)(2); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.01(B)(3). A tax that was assessed on the transfer of title for a motor vehicle between an individual and a limited liability company was overturned for lack of evidence that the transaction occurred “for consideration.” Dunagan v. Testa (Ohio B.T.A. 2013). Also within the meaning of sale under Ohio law is the furnishing of hotel lodging to transient guests, repair or installation of non-exempt tangible personal property, and providing washing or cleaning services to motor vehicles. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.01(B)(2); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.01(B)(3). Transactions occurring for the purpose of providing automatic data processing, computer, electronic information, or telecommunication services, as well as the provision of landscaping, building maintenance, and janitorial services, are also specifically included within the meaning of sale or selling under Ohio law. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.01(B)(3). The transfer of an interest in leased property where the original lessee and the terms of the original lease agreement remain unchanged are specifically excluded from the definition of sale under Ohio law. Other transactions that are specifically excluded include professional, insurance, or personal service transactions that involve the transfer of tangible personal property as an inconsequential element of the transaction and for which no separate charges are made. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.01(B). BNA-SUTN OH 1.4.1.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Use' or 'Storage, Use, or Consumption'

Defined “Use”is the exercise of any right or power incidental to ownership. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.01(C). A thing is “used” in the state if its consumer gives or otherwise distributes it, without charge, to recipients in this state. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.01(C). Where an unlicensed dealer “exercised ownership and control” over vehicles by purchasing the vehicles outside the state and transporting them to the dealer's Ohio home, “albeit for a limited time while waiting to transport them out of state,”use tax was appropriately assessed. Dotzauer v. Testa (Ohio B.T.A. 2015). Use also includes giving or otherwise distributing the property without charge to recipients within Ohio. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.01(C). BNA-SUTN OH 1.4.3.

==================================================

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Tangible Personal Property'

Defined In Ohio, “tangible personal property” means personal property that can be seen, weighed, measured, felt, or touched, or that is in any other manner perceptible to the senses. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.01(YY). Such property includes motor vehicles, electricity, water, gas, steam, and prewritten computer software. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.01(YY). BNA-SUTN OH 1.4.4.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Retailer' or 'Vendor'

Defined Ohio does not define the term “retailer,” but instead defines “seller”as a person from whom a purchase is made, and includes every person engaged in the state or elsewhere in the business of selling tangible personal property or providing a service for storage, use, or other consumption or benefit in the state. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.01(E); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.01. The term “vendor”means the person providing a taxable service, or the person obtaining a sales tax license or effecting the transfer of a taxable sale. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.01(C). A telecommunications service vendor that provides a “900-” telephone service is considered a “vendor” under the sales tax. Also, two or more persons are considered a single vendor if they are engaged in business at the same location under a single trade name in which all sales collections by each are made. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.01(C). Physicians, dentists, hospitals, and veterinarians who are engaged in selling tangible personal property as received from others, such as eyeglasses, mouthwashes, dentifrices, or similar articles, are vendors. Veterinarians who are engaged in transferring drugs to others for a consideration, the dispensing of which does not require an order of a licensed veterinarian or physician under federal law are vendors. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.01(C). BNA-SUTN OH 1.4.6.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Purchaser' or 'Consumer'

Defined “Consumer”means the person for whom the service is provided, to whom the transfer effected or license given by a sale is or is to be made or given, to whom the service is charged, or to whom the admission is granted. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.01(D)(1). “Consumer”also includes any person who has purchased tangible personal property or has been provided a service for storage, use, or other consumption or benefit in this state. It does not include a person who receives tangible personal property or a service without charge. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.01(F). BNA-SUTN OH 1.4.7.
