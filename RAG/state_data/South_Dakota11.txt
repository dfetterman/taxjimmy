Codified Laws Ann. §10-52-2. Further, municipalities may impose a 1-percent gross receipts tax on certain transactions. S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §10-52A-2. This gross receipts tax may be imposed upon all leases or rentals of hotel, motel, campsite, or other lodging accommodations that are leased or rented for periods of fewer than 28 consecutive days, sales of alcoholic beverages, sales at establishments where the public is invited to eat, dine, or purchase and carry out prepared food for immediate consumption, and ticket sales or admissions to places of amusement, athletic, or cultural events. See South Dakota Sales and Use Tax Guide—September 2018.

South Dakota law defines municipality as all cities and towns organized under the laws of the state and not including any other political subdivisions. S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §9-1-1. Although the statutory language of the uniform municipal non-ad valorem tax is broad enough to allow for the imposition of any municipal non-ad valorem tax, South Dakota law generally applies the statute as authorization of a municipal sales and use tax at a rate of up to 2 percent. S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §10-52-2; South Dakota Municipal Tax Information Bulletin—July 2018. A municipal sales and use tax must conform in application to the state sales and use tax. S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §10-52-2; S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §10-52A-2. Municipal Sales and Use Tax A sales or use tax, not to exceed 2 percent, may be enacted by a local governing body or through voter approval. S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §10-52-3. Furthermore, upon a two thirds vote of the governing body, an additional 1-percent municipal non-ad valorem tax may be imposed in a municipality with warranted indebtedness of equal to or greater than 50 percent of its current budget and must be used to eliminate such indebtedness. S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §10-52-2.4. When a municipality enacts a new municipal sales and use tax or amends an existing municipal sales or use tax, the tax can only become effective on January 1 or July 1 of a calendar year. S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §10-52-9. The new municipal sales and use tax ordinance or amendment will take effect on the earlier of the January 1, or July 1 date after a minimum of 90 days notice from the municipality to the Secretary of Revenue and regulation.

However, no such refund is available for the state sales and use tax on manufacturing machinery. S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §10-52-10; S.D. Admin. R. 64:06:03:23; S.D. Admin. R. 64:06:03:24.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Historical Information

Est. 1935 South Dakota enacted a sales tax in 1935 to help the state recover financially from an ineffective income tax. South Dakota Tax Facts No. 316; see also Council of State Governments, Only in the Midwest, Nov. 2011. Several years later, South Dakota also enacted the use tax, as it was discovered that consumers were leaving the state to make tax-free purchases. South Dakota does not have an income tax and therefore relies on sales and use tax revenues heavily.

Wayfair, a retailer is no longer required to have a physical presence in a state in order to be subject to the state's sales and use tax collection and remittance requirements. See South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., 138 S. Ct. 2080, 2018 BL 219995 (U.S. 2018).
