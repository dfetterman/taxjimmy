In facilities where machinery and equipment are necessary to burn both residual and nonresidual fuels, the exemption is prorated. If it is determined that 15 percent or less of all electrical or steam energy generated was produced by burning residual fuel, the full exemption will apply. Purchasers claiming a partial exemption must obtain such exemption by refund of taxes paid, or as otherwise provided in the department's rules. Florida courts have embraced the integrated plant theory as a basis for interpreting the exemption for machinery and equipment used in producing electrical or steam energy. See Jacksonville Electric Auth. v. Florida Dept. of Rev., 486 So. 2d 1350 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1986); see also Florida Technical Assistance Advisement 07A-006 (Mar. 15, 2007) (all purchases of machinery, equipment, and components for a combined cycle and gasification facility at an electrical generating facility qualified for exemption). Under the “integrated plant theory,” machinery and equipment used in generating electrical energy, regardless that such machinery and equipment were not intrinsically necessary to generate electrical energy or the sole purpose of such machinery and equipment was to make the plant function more practically, would be considered a component part of the manufacturing process. Florida Technical Assistance Advisement 99A-077 (Dec. 12, 1999) (machinery and equipment used in the process of generating electrical energy, but not distribution, qualify for exemption). However, only the machinery and equipment used in the process of generating electrical energy qualifies for exemption. The exemption does not extend to switchyard, distribution, or transmission machinery and equipment at a facility. Generally, the exemption is considered as ending at the first step-up transformer, or at that point where the electrical power is at such a voltage level that is necessary for transmission to the electrical grid. The exemption will include all such electrical equipment as is necessary for internal plant purposes, such as cabling, rack systems, ducts, instrumentation, monitoring equipment, grounding, cathodic protection, and interconnect facilities. Florida Technical Assistance Advisement 18A-005 (March 28, 2018). Additionally, the exemption does not extend to real property improvements at a generating facility. Accordingly, site improvements that do not constitute foundations or sub-surface improvements for foundations for machinery and equipment that is integral to the production of electrical energy will not qualify for exemption. Structures or facilities whose only purpose is to enclose, provide shelter, or control environments for qualifying items of machinery and equipment are considered to be an integral part of that machinery and equipment and do not constitute real property improvements. Accordingly, such structures or facilities will qualify for exemption. Florida Technical Assistance Advisement 18A-005 (March 28, 2018). BNA-SUTN FL 30.4.

Depends Florida does not a specific exemption for property used in wastewater treatment;therefore, such items are generally taxable. Fla. Stat. §212.01 et seq.; Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.001 et seq. However, in some cases, wastewater treatment activities may be considered pollution control and qualify for the exemption for machinery, equipment, and other materials for pollution control. Florida Technical Assistance Advisement 12A-001 (Jan. 4, 2012) (allowing pollution control exemption for property used in wastewater treatment); see Fla. Stat. §212.051. For more information on the pollution control exemption, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Florida 27.1.6.6. BNA-SUTN FL 30.7.
