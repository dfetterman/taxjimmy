Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Real Property

Nontaxable Sales of real property are not subject to the sales or use tax in Alabama because it is not tangible personal property. Ala. Code §40-23-2(1). Tangible personal property loses its identity as such, when it becomes attached to, and a part of, the real property, and when removing the tangible personal property would damage or deface the real property. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.28; Alabama Revenue Ruling 01-011 (Oct. 15, 2001). BNA-SUTN AL 28.1.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal General Rule for Classification

Nontaxable A device or appliance becomes a fixture and a part of the real property to which it is connected when it is built into or is attached to a structure so that its removal would substantially damage or deface such structure. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.28(2). In determining whether a fixture becomes a part of real property or retains its character as tangible personal property, Alabama examines whether the removal of a device or an appliance from a structure would substantially damage or deface such structure. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.28(3). When removing the tangible personal property would not damage the real property, it might still be considered attached or affixed to the real property if:• it is actually connected with or attached to the real property; Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.28(3)(a). and • the use or purpose of the tangible personal property becomes an element of the use or purpose of the real property to which it is connected. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.28(3)(b). In addition, Alabama administrative determinations and case law have focused on whether the intent was to make the items permanent fixtures. Alabama Revenue Ruling 03-412 (Feb. 3, 2004); Alabama Revenue Ruling 04-917 (Nov. 8, 2005). BNA-SUTN AL 28.2.1.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Construction Materials and Contracts Construction Materials and Contracts, Generally

Taxable Alabama imposes sales and use tax on building materials as sales at retail of tangible personal property. Ala. Code §40-23-1(a)(10); Ala. Code §40-23-60(5). Alabama sales and use tax laws define “building materials” as all tangible personal property, including any device or appliance used by builders, contractors, or landowners in making improvements, additions, alterations or repairs to real property so that such tangible personal property becomes identified with a part of realty. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.28(1). Building Materials Building materials include such tangible personal property as lumber, timber, nails, steel, cement, brick, tile, glass, paint, and any other tangible personal property which becomes a part of real property. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.27(2). In Alabama, contractors are responsible at the time of purchase for the tax due on building materials used to add to, repair, or alter real property, the contractors are considered to be the consumers of such goods. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.27(2); see also Alabama Administrative Law Judge Ruling Docket No. S. 14-1006 (Dec. 7. 2015) (taxpayer found to be a dual business rather than a contractor not required to pay sales tax at the time of purchase; sales tax due when items are sold at retail or withdrawn for use). Custom Built Signs Custom built signs affixed to real property come within the “building materials” provision, with tax due from the person who erects the sign to his supplier for materials used in constructing the sign. No taxes are due for services involved in installing the sign onto real property. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.27(2); Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.112(2). Self-produced Construction Materials and Items When a construction contractor installs on real property building materials that the contractor itself manufactured, tax generally applies to the fair market value of the materials. However, in the case of self-produced ready-mix concrete or asphalt, the contractor is subject to tax only on its cost of the ingredients incorporated into the ready-mix concrete or asphalt. Ala. Code §40-23-1(b). Similarly, in the case of self-produced modular building components or units, the contractor is subject to tax only on its cost of materials incorporated into the components or units. Ala. Code §40-23-1(a)(10); Ala. Code §40-23-60(5); Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.105(2)(b); Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.105(3)(b). Contractors Acting as Contractor and Retailer Generally, sales of building materials to contractors, builders, or landowners for resale or use in the form of real estate are retail sales, subject to sales tax. Ala. Code §40-23-1(a)(10). However, if a contractor qualifies as a “dual business,” the contractor is not required to pay sales tax when it purchases materials from vendors. The contractor purchases the items that they sell and withdraw for use at wholesale exempt from tax. If used to fulfill a construction contract, the supplies are treated as withdrawals from inventory, and the contractor is responsible for sales tax due on such supplies. If the contractor sells the supplies at retail, the contractor is responsible for collecting the tax due on the sale from the purchaser. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.56; Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.150.05; Alabama Administrative Law Judge Ruling Docket No. S. 14-1006 (Dec. 7. 2015). A dual business is a business that both makes retail sales of tangible personal property to the public on a recurring basis and withdraws tangible personal property for use from the same stock of goods. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.56(1). The business must have a substantial number of retail sales. Contractors, plumbers, repairmen, and others who make isolated or accommodation sales and who have not set themselves up as being engaged in selling do not qualify as a dual business, and must pay tax on all taxable property purchased. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.56(3). Thus, in the matter of Vision Southeast Companies v. Alabama Dept. of Rev., the taxpayer, a company that both installed building security systems for government and commercial customers and sold security components and other materials at retail, was found to be a dual business. The company installed its security systems for customers in Alabama and throughout the southeastern U.S., and maintained a general inventory of items from which it made sales and withdrew for use as part of its furnish and install contracts. The company did not pay sales tax when purchasing its materials, but rather, collected sales tax on the items when sold at retail to nonexempt customers or paid sales tax when it used materials from inventory for use in its installation contracts. For the audit period at question, the taxpayer made approximately $2 million in retail sales which constituted about 10 percent of the taxpayer's total business for the period. The administrative law judge determined that the taxpayer had made substantial and recurring sales during the audit period that were sufficient to meet the requirements of the dual business regulation, Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.56. Ultimately, the ALJ found the taxpayer had correctly collected sales tax on the items sold at retail, but had incorrectly paid sales tax on the marked-up prices of the items used in its furnish and install contracts. The taxpayer should have paid sales tax on the wholesale cost of materials withdrawn for use in its furnish and install contracts, regardless of where the contract was performed or the tax status of its customers. The ALJ further held that the Department of Revenue properly assessed use tax, but only on those items used for contracts performed in Alabama, including contracts for tax-exempt entities.

When a contractor provides an invoice to a customer showing a separation of charges for materials and for services, the materials charges will not be subject to sales tax, because the contractor has already paid the tax at the time of purchase.

Defined A contractor may be a dual business, or a contractor-retailer, if the contractor makes retail sales of tangible personal property to the public on a recurring basis and withdraws tangible personal property for use from the same stock of goods. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.56(1).

If used to fulfill a construction contract, the supplies are treated as withdrawals from inventory, and the contractor is responsible for sales tax on the withdrawal. If the contractor sells the supplies at retail, the contractor must collect and remit the tax on the sale. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.56; Ala. Admin.

Taxable Mobile Homes Alabama taxes the sale of mobile homes at the state's reduced automotive tax rate of 2 percent, whether or not the home is sold by a vendor or sold through a casual sale. Ala. Code §40-23-2(4); Ala. Code §40-23-61(c); Ala. Code §40-23-101(a); Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-2-.32(1). However, when a mobile home is removed from inventory for use in the daily operations of a business, the taxpayer is not responsible for tax as would normally be the case in a withdrawal from inventory, but rather must pay $5 for each period of 12 months in which the mobile home is being used. Ala. Code §40-23-2(4); Ala. Code §40-23-61(c); Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-2-.32(1). The reduced automotive rate also applies to parts, attachments, and accessories for mobile homes, if sold along with a mobile home. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-2-.32(2). Mobile homes, whether double-wide or standard, do not qualify as modular buildings. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-2-.15.03. Modular Buildings An in-state builder of manufactured homes who builds such homes for resale to individuals who affix them to real property must obtain a sales tax license and purchase all building materials, fixtures, and other equipment becoming part of the manufactured home without paying sales or use tax to its suppliers. The builder of the manufactured homes must collect sales tax on any retail sales of the components or units sold in Alabama and report and pay the sales tax on these retail sales. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.105(2)(a). Out-of-state builders or manufacturers of modular building components or units who have nexus with the state must register to collect sellers use tax on their Alabama sales of modular building components or units sold to businesses that affix them to real property and must report and remit the tax due to the state. Purchases of modular building components or units from out-of-state builders or manufacturers not registered to collect sellers use tax are subject to consumers use tax. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.105(3)(a). If an in-state builder or manufacturer of modular building components or units that has obtained a sales tax license contracts to affix modular building components or units to realty either in-state or out-of-state, the builder or manufacturer is liable for sales tax levied on its cost price of the materials withdrawn from inventory and used to build or manufacture the components or units. Ala. Code §40-23-1(a)(10); Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.105(2)(b).
