Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Tangible Personal Property

Depends Generally, in Texas, a sale of a taxable item is sourced to the local taxing jurisdiction in which the sale is consummated, regardless of where title is transferred. See Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.203(a). If a retailer has only one place of business in Texas, all of the retail sales are consummated at the place of business. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.203(a); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §323.203(a); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §323.203(b). A place of business is defined as an established outlet, office or location operated by a seller for the purpose of selling taxable items. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.334(a)(14). A seller is only required to collect local sales or use taxes for a local taxing jurisdiction in which the seller is engaged in business. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.334(g)(3). Property Shipped Outside of Texas The sale of tangible personal property shipped outside of Texas is exempt from tax if the shipment is made by the seller by means of the facilities of the seller, delivery by the seller to a carrier for shipment to a consignee at a point outside of Texas, or delivery by the seller to a forwarding agent for shipment to a location in another state of the U.S. or its territories or possessions. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.330(a). The seller must keep documentation of the out-of-state shipment. Documents such as a bill of lading, a private delivery company's receipt, or postal receipt, in conjunction with an invoice with an out-of-state shipping address, have been found sufficient to document an out-of-state sale. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.330(a). See, e.g., Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,025 (Feb. 7, 2017) (where taxpayer has shipping invoices that are not connected to specific sales, such documentation is not sufficient to establish an out-of-state sale); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,157 (May 6, 2016) (due to evidentiary gaps, a tractor rental company could not prove that its tractor rentals were for out-of-state shipment; the company did not track the use of its rented items). Multiple Business Locations In General If a retailer has more than one place of business in Texas, each sale will be consummated at the place of business of the retailer where the retailer first receives the order, provided the order is placed in-person by the purchaser or lessee. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.203(c); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §323.203(c). Orders Not Placed In-Person However, if the retailer has more than one place of business in Texas and the order is not placed in-person by the purchaser or lessee, then the sale is consummated at the place of business:• from which the retailer ships or delivers the item to a location designated by the purchaser or lessee;or • where the purchaser or lessee takes possession and removes the tangible personal property from a place of the business of the retailer. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.203(c-1); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §323.203(c-1). Orders Not Placed at the Place of Business If an order is not received at the retailer's place of business, the order is consummated at the place of business from which the agent or employee who took the order operates. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.203(d)(2); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §323.203(d)(2). Internet, Telephone, and Mail Order Sales Orders placed over the internet, by telephone, or through the mail are consummated at the retailer's place of business in Texas from which the items are shipped, if the items are shipped from a place of business of the seller in Texas. Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 151.107; Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286; Texas Fiscal Notes - August 2015. Drop Shipments and Out-of-State Retailers A sale is consummated at the delivery location or place where the customer takes possession if the delivery originates from or possession is taken from a location in Texas other than a place of business of the retailer and:• the retailer is an itinerant vendor who has no place of business in Texas; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.203(e)(1); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §323.203(e)(1). But see Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.203(e-1) and Tex. Tax Code Ann. §323.203(e-1)as added by 2019 Tex.

Tax Code Ann. §323.203(e)(2). or • the purchaser places the order directly with the retailer's supplier and the item is delivered directly to the purchaser by the supplier. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.203(e)(3); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §323.203(e)(3). Marketplace Sellers Effective Oct. 1, 2019, sales made by a marketplace seller through a marketplace are consummated at the location in Texas to which the item is shipped or delivered, or where possession is taken by the purchaser. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.203(e-1) and Tex. Tax Code Ann. §323.203(e-1),as added by 2019 Tex. H.B. 1525, effective Oct. 1, 2019. “Marketplace”is defined as a physical or electronic medium through which persons other than the owner or operator of the medium make sales of taxable items. It is important to note that this term includes stores, website, software, application, and catalogs. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0242(1), as added by 2019 Tex. H.B. 1525, effective Oct. 1, 2019. Further, “marketplace seller” is defined as a seller, other than the marketplace provider, who makes a sale of a taxable item through a marketplace. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0242(3), as added by 2019 Tex. H.B. 1525, effective Oct. 1, 2019. Special Rules for Certain Warehouses Effective Sept. 1, 2014, when a retailer has an economic development agreement with a county in which the retailer operates a warehouse/place of business, local tax is due based on the location from which the retailer ships the tangible personal property. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.203(c-2); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §323.203(c-2). The special sourcing rule for shipments from warehouses expired on Sept. 1, 2014. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.203(c-3); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §323.203(c-3). Natural Gas and Electricity The sale of natural gas and electricity is sourced at the point of delivery to the customer. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.203(f); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §323.203(f). Use of Items Obtained with a Resale Certificate If a purchaser who has given a resale certificate makes use of a taxable item that subjects the taxable item to sales tax, the use of the taxable item causes local tax to be due based on where the taxable item is stored or kept at the time of, or just before, the use. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.203(i); Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 323.203(i). Nonresidential Real Property Repairs The sale of a service to remodel, repair, or restore nonresidential real property is consummated at the location of the job site. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.203(n). Locations That Exist for Tax Avoidance If there is no place of business of the retailer because the Comptroller determines that a facility functions or exists to avoid sales and use tax, a sale is consummated at the place of business of the retailer from whom the outlet, office, facility, or location purchased the taxable item for resale to the contracting business. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.203(m); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §323.203(m).

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Services

Depends For local tax purposes, services are sourced in the same manner as tangible personal property, although a few services are sourced based on the location where the service benefit is realized. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.334. Texas allows an exemption from state and local tax for certain services that are used both inside and outside the state, to the extent the services are used outside the state. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.330. Garbage and Waste Services Local tax is due on garbage or other solid waste collection or removal service where waste is collected. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.203(k); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §323.203(k). Telecommunications Services A telecommunications service sold based on a price that is measured by individual calls is consummated at the location where a call originates and terminates at the location where a call either originates or terminates and at which the service address is also located. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.203(g-1); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §323.203(g-1). The sale of a telecommunications service sold on a basis other than call-by-call is sourced to the customer's place of primary use. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.203(g-2); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §323.203(g-2). A post-paid calling service is consummated where the telecommunication signal originates or where the signal is first identified by the seller's telecommunication system or by information received from the seller's service provider. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.203(g-3); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §323.203(g-3). Cable Services Cable television services are sourced based on where the service is delivered to the consumer. Tex.

Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.203(h); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §323.203(h); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.298(k). Data Processing Services To the extent that a data processing service is used to support a separate, identifiable segment of a customer's business (other than general administration or operation of the business) the service is presumed to be used at the location where that part of the business is conducted. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.330(f); see also Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 109,657 (Jan. 20, 2016). Services are “used” where the direct or indirect benefit of the service is received. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing Nos. 105,328, 109,280 (Feb. 20, 2018) (it was not determinative that the business' employees were located in Texas because receipt is not synonymous with benefit). A “separate, identifiable segment”is a part of a business that has its own identity apart from and performs a function that is separate from the general administration or operation of the company. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 109,657 (Jan. 20, 2016). Data processing services used to support the general administration or operation of a business are sourced to the company's principal place of business. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 109,657 (Jan. 20, 2016). A company's principal place of business is deemed to be the place from which trade or business is directed or managed. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,839 (May 26, 2017). If data processing services cannot be assigned to a separate, identifiable segment, they are presumed to be used to support the taxpayer's business generally at the principal place of business. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,839 (May 26, 2017); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 114,368 (June 5, 2018). Security Services and Debt Collection With regard to security services and debt collection services, Texas applies the following test:• Charges for providing security service to property or persons located in Texas are subject to Texas sales tax. Unless a customer claims a multistate benefit, as provided below, tax is due on a security service if any portion of the service originates in Texas. Detective and investigation services of corporate locations outside of Texas are not taxable if the investigation is unrelated to a Texas location. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34 § 3.333(e). • Tax is due on debt collection services when the address of the debtor was in Texas when the account was placed for collection and the creditor is engaged in business in Texas. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34 § 3.354(b). • To the extent a security service or debt collection service is provided for a separate, identifiable segment of a customer's business, the service is presumed to benefit the location where that part of the customer's business is conducted. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34 § 3.333(p); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34 § 3.354(g). • To the extent the use of the service cannot be assigned to an identifiable segment of a creditor's business, the service is presumed to be used to support the administration or operation of the creditor's business generally.

Code tit. 34 § 3.333(p); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34 § 3.354(g). • If a multi-state customer claims that part of the service benefits the customer's business at locations both within and outside the state, the customer must provide the service provider with an exemption certificate in lieu of tax. It will then be the customer's responsibility to report the tax to this office for that portion of the service that benefits Texas locations. The service will not be taxable to the extent the customer can establish benefit outside Texas. A multi-state customer may use any reasonable method for allocation that is supported by business records. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34 § 3.333(p); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34 § 3.354(g). • A debt collector who accepts a certificate in good faith is relieved of responsibility for collecting and remitting tax on transactions to which the certificate relates. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34 § 3.333(p); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34 § 3.354(g). Information Services, Credit Reporting Services, and Insurance Services With regard to information services, credit reporting services, and insurance services, Texas applies the following test:• Sales tax is due on credit reporting activities when the address of the credit applicant is in Texas and the person who requested the credit report is engaged in business in Texas. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34 § 3.343(b). • Insurance services are subject to sales tax if the individual, entity, or property that is the object of the service is in Texas and the company for which the services are performed is engaged in business in Texas. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34 § 3.355(d). • To the extent that information services, credit reporting services, or insurance services are used to support separate, identifiable segments of a customer's business (other than general administration or operation of the business) the services are presumed to be used at the location where that part of the business is conducted.

Code tit. 34 § 3.355(j). • If that part of the business is conducted at locations both within and outside the state, the service is not taxable to the extent it is used outside Texas.

Code tit. 34 § 3.355(j). • A multi-state customer purchasing services for the benefit of both in-state and out-of-state locations is responsible for issuing to the service provider an exemption certificate asserting a multi-state benefit, and for reporting and paying the tax on that portion of the charge for information services, credit reporting charges, or insurance service charges which will benefit the Texas location. A provider that accepts such a certificate in good faith is relieved of responsibility for collecting and remitting tax on transactions to which the certificate relates. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34 § 3.342(g); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34 § 3.343(f); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34 § 3.355(j). • The customer's books must support the assignment of the service to an identifiable segment of the business, the determination of the location or locations of the use of the service, and the allocation of the taxable charge to Texas.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Leases and Rentals

Depends Generally, a lease or rental agreement is considered a sale in Texas, and sales are sourced to the local jurisdiction in which the sale is consummated. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.005(2); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.203(a); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §323.203(a). Tangible personal property that is leased is sourced in the same manner as other sales of personal property. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.203. If property that was leased in Texas is brought into a municipality and no city sales tax is collected by the lessor, the lease payments are subject to use tax in that municipality, so long as the city tax will not exceed the 2-percent cap. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.205(b). Where a retailer has only one place of business in Texas, all of the retail sales are consummated at the place of business. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.203(b); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §323.203(b); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,390 (May 15, 2018). If the retailer has more than one place of business in Texas, property that is leased is sourced to the place of business where the where the retailer first receives the order, provided the lessee places the order in person. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.203(c); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §323.203(c); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.294(f)(1) (tax is due on operating or financing lease if lessee takes delivery in the state).

Although, counties, special purpose districts, and transit authorities may impose an additional tax, the total local tax rate may not exceed 2 percent. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.203(a); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §323.203(a). Generally, if a retailer has only one place of business in Texas, all of the retail sales are consummated at the place of business. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.203(b); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §323.203(b). A place of business is defined as an established outlet, office or location operated by a seller for the purpose of selling taxable items. Tex. Admin.

A seller is only required to collect local sales or use taxes for a local taxing jurisdiction in which the seller is engaged in business. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.334(g)(3). When collecting the use tax, a seller should not collect tax for two local taxing jurisdictions of the same type on the same transaction. Because special purpose district taxes are authorized under different statutes, a seller may, however, be required to collect more than one special purpose district tax on a sale. Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 200710981L (Oct. 19, 2007). When an order is placed in person at a seller's place of business in Texas or received at a seller's place of business in Texas, the sale is considered to have been consummated at the location where the order was placed or received, regardless of where the order was fulfilled. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.334(h)(3); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,553 (May 8, 2017).

In this situation, local tax is due based on the location from which the retailer ships the tangible personal property. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.203(c-2); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §323.203(c-2).

Cable Services Cable service providers are required to collect local sales and use tax due on the sale of cable television or bundled cable service, and on all services or expenses connected with the provision of that service, based upon the point of delivery to the purchaser. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.203(h); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §323.203(h); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.313(g)(1). The point of delivery is the address of a fixed physical connection or, in the case of services delivered via mobile telecommunications service provider, the purchaser's place of primary use of the mobile telecommunications service, or in all other cases, the purchaser's mailing or billing address.

Nontaxable A taxable use does not include the exercise of a right or power over or the retention of tangible personal property for the purpose of transporting property outside Texas for use solely outside of Texas. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.011(f). A Texas seller who sells a taxable item and ships or delivers it to an out-of-state location does not have to collect Texas state or local sales tax on the sale, even if the billing address is in Texas. To document such a sale, the seller's records must include proof of delivery out of state, such as a bill of lading, a shipping invoice or a postal receipt. A Texas seller engaged in business in another state may have to collect tax in that state. Texas Tax Policy News(November, 2010). See Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing Nos. 105,328, 109,280 (Feb. 20, 2018) (rejecting taxpayer's attempt to use a percentage to establish out-of-state sales); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,488 (Oct. 27, 2016) (taxpayer failed to prove his claim that aircraft was purchased solely for export to Mexico). Maquiladora Enterprises A maquiladora enterprise holding a maquiladora export permit may make tax-free purchases of goods to be exported to Mexico. To claim this exemption, the maquiladora enterprise must furnish its seller with: (1) a blanket maquiladora exemption certificate;and (2) a copy of its maquiladora export permit. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.156(a); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.358(e). “Maquiladora enterprises”include business entities chartered by the government of Mexico and authorized to make duty-free imports of raw materials, component parts, or other property into Mexico to be used in manufacturing, processing, or assembling items by the business entity in Mexico primarily for export from Mexico. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.156(f); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.358(a). The agent of a maquiladora enterprise may also make tax-free purchases in Texas of tangible personal property in certain circumstances. The permitted maquiladora enterprise may issue the Texas Maquiladora Exemption Certificate in either the maquiladora enterprise's name or the agent may issue the Texas Exemption Certificate in the name of the maquiladora enterprise and include its name as the agent. A maquiladora's agent may retain title to all or some of the exported property without negating its ability to act as the maquiladora's agent. To act as a maquiladora enterprise's agent, the agent must be able to show that the three key elements of an agency relationship are present. An agency relationship requires:one person acting for another; both consenting to the arrangement;and the agent operating under the principal's control. Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201807023L (July 18, 2018). Customs Brokers A customs broker, or an authorized employee of a customs broker, licensed by the Comptroller may issue documentation for the purpose of showing the exemption of tangible personal property. The Comptroller shall maintain a password-protected website that a customs broker, or an authorized employee of a customs broker, must use to prepare documentation to show the exemption of tangible personal property. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.157. When an exemption is claimed because tangible personal property is exported beyond the territorial limits of the United States, proof of export may be shown only by documentation, including a bill of lading, certifying that delivery was made to a point outside the territorial limits of the United States. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.307. BNA-SUTN TX 4.3.3.
