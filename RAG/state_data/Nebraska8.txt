Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Prepared Food Definition of 'Prepared Food'

Defined “Prepared food” includes food sold with eating utensils provided by the seller, including plates, knives, forks, spoons, glasses, cups, napkins, or straws (however, a plate does not include a container or packaging used to transport the food). Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2704.24(2)(e)(i); Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2704.24(2)(e)(ii). “Prepared food”is also two or more food ingredients mixed or combined by the seller for sale as a single item or food sold in a heated state or heated by the seller. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2704.24(2)(e)(i); Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2704.24(2)(e)(ii). Unless specifically exempt, or otherwise outside the definition, prepared food is subject to sales tax. The first statutory criterion for prepared food requires that utensils be provided by the seller. This raises the question of what it means to “provide”utensils, for which Nebraska has devised a Eating Utensil Test. Nebraska Information Guide No. 6-432-2005. Eating Utensils Test If more than 75 percent of the seller's sales of all food items are sales of: two or more food ingredients mixed or combined by the seller for sale as a single item; or food sold in a heated state or heated by the seller, then eating utensils are considered provided by the seller for all other food items if they are merely available on the premises where the food is sold. Nebraska Information Guide No. 6-432-2005. If 75 percent or less of the sales of all food by the seller sales of: two or more food ingredients mixed or combined by the seller for sale as a single item; or food sold in a heated state or heated by the seller, then eating utensils are considered provided by the seller for all other food items only if they are handed to the purchaser by the seller. In this scenario, utensils on the premises would not create the conditions necessary to satisfy the statutory criteria for prepared food, and would not be subject to tax. Nebraska Information Guide No. 6-432-2005. Prepared food does not include:• food that is only cut, repackaged, or pasteurized by the seller; Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2704.24(2)(e)(ii)(A). • eggs, fish, meat, poultry, and foods containing these raw animal foods requiring cooking by the consumer; Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2704.24(2)(e)(ii)(B). • food sold by a seller whose proper primary North American industry classification system classification is manufacturing in sector 311; Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2704.24(2)(e)(ii)(C). • food sold in an unheated state by weight or volume as a single item; Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2704.24(2)(e)(ii)(D). • bakery items, including bread, rolls, buns, biscuits, bagels, croissants, pastries, donuts, Danish, cakes, tortes, pies, tarts, muffins, bars, cookies, and tortillas; Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2704.24(2)(e)(ii)(E). and • for sales occurring on or after Oct. 1, 2016, food that ordinarily requires additional cooking to finish the product to its desired final condition. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2704.24(2)(e)(ii)(F) as amended by 2016 Neb. L.B. 776, effective Oct. 1, 2016. See also Nebraska Dept. of Rev., Letter re: Nebraska's 2016 SST Recertification. Retailers making sales of prepared food that is not consumed on the retailer's premises are required to pay the Nebraska Litter Fee on these sales. Examples of these sales include carry-out and to-go sales. Nebraska Information Guide No. 6-432-2005. For more information on the Nebraska Litter Fee, see the Excise Tax Navigator at Nebraska 7.5.1.
