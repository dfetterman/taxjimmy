Topic: Imposition of Tax Pending and Trending Developments

Exemptions for Oil & Gas Production The Texas Comptroller recently prevailed in a refund case that would have exposed Texas to a financial liability with the potential to wipe out the state's projected budget surplus. Sw. Royalties, Inc. v. Hegar, 500 S.W.3d 400, 2016 BL 193796 (Tex. 2016). The refund case, on appeal from the Texas Court of Appeals for the Third District, sought to determine whether metal pipes, tubing and other equipment used in oil and gas production are exempt from sales tax as manufacturing equipment used in processing. The taxpayer sought a refund for the mineral extraction equipment on the basis of a tax exemption for property used in manufacturing; the comptroller argued that the term processing must be construed narrowly. Sw. Royalties, Inc. v. Combs, 501 S.W.3d 95, 2014 BL 223403 (Tex. App. 2014). The Texas Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals, finding that the equipment for which Southwest Royalties sought an exemption was not used to actually manufacture, process, or fabricate the hydrocarbons being extracted. The court's decision effectively denied the company's tax refund claim. Sw. Royalties, Inc. v. Hegar, 500 S.W.3d 400, 2016 BL 193796 (Tex. 2016). BNA-SUTN TX 1.3.

Lone Star Gas Co., 567 S.W. 2d 493 (Tex. 1978)Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 46,207 (Aug. 3, 2007) (use tax was applicable to an aircraft that had been brought into the state more than 12 months after its purchase because the evidence suggested the aircraft had been purchased for use in Texas and the taxpayer had intentionally delayed moving the aircraft into the state in order to take advantage of the presumption that property purchased and used outside of the state for 12 months is not intended for use in the state). “Use” also includes the incorporation of tangible personal property into real estate or into improvements of real estate regardless of whether the real estate is subsequently sold, except as provided by Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 151.056(b). Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.011(a). With respect to taxable services, “use”means the direct or indirect benefit from the service in the state. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.011(b); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.346(a)(2). However, the definition of “use”does not include the:• sale of tangible personal property or a taxable service in the regular course of business; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.011(c); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.346(a)(2)(A). • transfer of a taxable service as an integral part of the transfer of tangible personal property in the regular course of business; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.011(c); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.346(a)(2)(B). • transfer of tangible personal property as an integral part of the transfer of a taxable service in the regular course of business; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.011(c); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.346(a)(2)(C). • exercise of a right or power over tangible personal property for the purpose of subsequently transporting the property outside Texas for use solely outside of Texas; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.011(f)(1); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.346(a)(2)(D). or • exercise of a right or power over tangible personal property for the purpose of processing, fabricating, or manufacturing of tangible personal property into other property or attaching the tangible personal property to or incorporating the tangible personal property into other property that will be transported outside Texas for use solely outside of Texas. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.011(f)(2); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.346(a)(2)(E). Texas defines the term “storage”as the keeping or retaining of tangible personal property in Texas for any purpose other than transporting the property outside of Texas for use solely outside of Texas; See Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.011(d) (providing the general rule); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.011(f)(1); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.346(a)(1)(A). or processing, fabricating, or manufacturing the property into other property or attaching the property to, or incorporating the property into, other property to be transported outside of Texas for use solely outside of Texas. See Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.011(d) (providing the general rule); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.011(f)(2); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.346(a)(1)(B). However, the definition does not include keeping or retaining tangible personal property for sale in the regular course of business. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.011(e). Property Stored in Texas by Owner Before Export In general, under the U.S. Constitution's Import and Export Clause, tangible personal property imported into or exported from Texas to another country is exempt from taxation if the property retains its character as an import or export. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.323(b); see also U.S. Const. art. I, § 10, cl. 2. However, property stored or otherwise used or consumed in Texas by the owner loses its exemption as an export. Sufficient time will be allowed to arrange for shipping. Property in Texas longer than 30 days from date of purchase will be presumed to have been stored. Any use of the property in Texas by the owner prior to export also causes the loss of the export exemption. Property in the hands of a freight forwarder is not covered by this provision. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.323(c)(3). BNA-SUTN TX 1.4.3.
