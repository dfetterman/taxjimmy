Retail sales, excluding the lease or rental of tangible personal property, must be sourced as follows: Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.360. • if property is received by the purchaser at the seller's place of business, the retail sale is sourced at that place of business; • if the property is not received by the purchaser at the seller's place of business, the retail sale is sourced at the location indicated by delivery instructions, or at the location where the purchaser receives the property; • the retail sale is sourced at the purchaser's address in the seller's business records if the above sourcing rules do not apply; • the retail sale is sourced at the purchaser's address obtained during the consummation of the sale or the address of the payment instrument if the above two sourcing rules do not apply; • in all other circumstances, the retail sale is sourced at the seller's shipping address. If the sale was delivered electronically, the sale is sourced at the address from where it was first available for transmission by the seller. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.360. Businesses that purchase property from out-of-state vendors for use within Nevada are subject to the use tax. However, a tax credit is available for sales tax paid in another state up to the Nevada tax rate in the county of use. Nev. Admin. Code ch. 372, §372.055. Generally, Nevada use tax is due on property acquired out of state in a transaction that would be taxable in Nevada. Nevada Tax Notes, No. 138 (April, 2002). Transportation Equipment A lease or rental of transportation equipment is sourced the same as a retail sale. See generally Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.375. “Transportation equipment” is defined as:• locomotive and railcars used for the carriage of persons or property in interstate commerce; Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.350(2)(a). • trucks and truck trailers having a manufacturer's gross vehicle weight rating of more than 10,000 lbs.; Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.350(2)(b). • trailers, semitrailers, and passenger buses that are registered pursuant to the International Registration Plan Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.350(2)(b)(1). or operated under federal authority; Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.350(2)(b)(2). • aircraft operated by an air carrier who is authorized by the federal government or a foreign government to engage in the carriage of persons or property in interstate or foreign commerce; Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.350(2)(c). and • containers designed for use on, and component parts attached or secured to, any of the above items. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.350(2)(d). Sourcing of Direct Mail Sales Nevada defines “direct mail” as printed material delivered or distributed by the U. S. Postal Service or another delivery service to a mass audience or to addresses contained on a mailing list provided by a purchaser or at the direction of a purchaser when the cost of the items purchased is not billed directly to the recipients. Direct mail includes tangible personal property that is supplied directly or indirectly by the purchaser to the seller of the direct mail for inclusion in the package containing the printed material, but does not include multiple items of printed material delivered to a single address. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.281(6). “Advertising and promotional direct mail” means direct mail, the primary purpose of which is to attract public attention to a product (tangible personal property, a product transferred electronically, or a service), person, business or organization, or to attempt to sell, popularize or secure financial support for a product, person, business or organization. “Other direct mail” means any direct mail that is not advertising and promotional direct mail, regardless of whether any advertising and promotional direct mail is included in the same mailing. Other direct mail includes transactional direct mail that contains personal information specific to the addressee (including invoices, bills, statements of account and payroll advices), any legally required mailings (including privacy notices, tax reports and stockholder reports), and other nonpromotional direct mail delivered to existing or former shareholders, customers, employees or agents (including newsletters and informational pieces). Other direct mail does not include the development of billing information or the provision of any data processing service that is more than incidental. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.281(6). Purchasers of advertising and promotional direct mail may provide sellers with documentation of the purchaser's direct pay permit, a certificate or written statement claiming the direct mail in a form approved by the Department, or an informational statement of the jurisdictions to which the direct mail is to be delivered to recipients. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.281(1)(a). If a purchaser of advertising and promotional direct mail provides the direct pay permit documentation or the certificate or written statement, the sale is deemed to take place in the jurisdictions to which the direct mail is to be delivered to recipients. The purchaser must report and pay any applicable sales or use taxes due and the seller, in the absence of bad faith, is relieved of all obligations to collect, pay or remit any applicable sales or use taxes. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.281(1)(b), as amended by 2015 Nev. A.B. 57, effective July 1, 2015. If a purchaser of advertising and promotional direct mail provides an informational statement to the seller, the sale is deemed to take place in the jurisdictions to which the direct mail is to be delivered. In this situation, the seller is required to collect and remit any applicable sales or use taxes due to those jurisdictions, and if the seller so complies and there is no bad faith, the seller is relieved of any further obligations to collect any additional sales or use taxes on the sale. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.281(1)(c) Except as otherwise specified, sales of other direct mail are deemed to take place at the address of the purchaser indicated in the business records of the seller that are maintained in the ordinary course of the seller's business, unless the use of that address would constitute bad faith. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.281(2); Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.360(3) If a purchaser of other direct mail provides documentation of a direct pay permit or a certificate or written statement claiming the direct mail in a form approved by the Department, the sale is deemed to take place at the jurisdiction to which the other direct mail is to be delivered to the recipients. The purchaser must report and pay any applicable sales or use taxes due, and the seller, in absence of bad faith, is relieved of all obligations to collect, pay, or remit any applicable sales or use taxes. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.281(2)(c), as amended by 2015 Nev. A.B. 57, effective July 1, 2015. BNA-SUTN NV 4.1.1.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Local Sourcing

Depends The retail sale of all tangible personal property, excluding the lease or rental of tangible personal property, within Nevada are sourced to the seller's place of business if the property purchased is received by the purchaser at the seller's place of business. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.360(1); see Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §374.723. If the property is not received by the purchaser at the seller's place of business the transaction is sourced to either the place where the purchaser has asked that the property be delivered to, or, if no delivery destination is given, to the place where the purchaser takes delivery of the property. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.360(2); see Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §374.723. If none of the above options apply, the transaction is sourced to the address of the purchaser as found on the business records of the seller. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.360(3); see Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §374.723. If no address is had in the business's records, the transaction is sourced to any address provided by the purchaser during the consummation of the sale, including the address of the purchaser's instrument of payment. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.360(4); see Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §374.723. If all these methods fail, the transaction is sourced to the location from where the property was shipped. Nev. Rev.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Credit for Tax Paid to Another Jurisdiction

Yes Nevada allows a credit toward the amount of sales or use tax due to Nevada in an amount that is equal to sales tax legitimately paid for the same purchase of tangible personal property to a state or local government outside Nevada. Nev. Admin. Code ch. 372, §372.055. The credit is allowed upon proof of payment deemed satisfactory to the department. Nev. Admin. Code ch. 372, §372.055. In order to receive credit for tax paid to another state, the tax paid must be levied in the same manner as Nevada's sales tax. The Nevada Supreme Court has held that a taxpayer was not entitled to a use tax credit for payment of Arizona's Transaction Privilege Tax on the purchase of coal slurry, because the Transaction Privilege Tax is not levied in the same manner as a sales tax and is not regarded as a sales tax. S. Cal. Edison v. Nevada Dept. of Taxn., 133 Nev. Adv. Rep. 49, 2017 BL 262146 (Nev. 2017). BNA-SUTN NV 4.2.
