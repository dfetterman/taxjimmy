Qualifying purchases include taxable purchases of railway cars, locomotives, fuel, lubricants, repair parts, accessories, service contracts, and repair, maintenance, and installation services for a motor vehicle, railroad car, locomotive, or airplane the carrier operates. Effective June 12, 2018, N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.14(a) was clarified to indicate that qualifying items and services purchased by an interstate carrier must be taxable in North Carolina to be eligible for a refund. N.C. Gen.

The refund is calculated by first creating a mileage ratio. The mileage ratio is a fraction where the numerator is the number of miles the carrier operated all motor vehicles, railroad cars, locomotives, and airplanes in North Carolina during the refund period and the denominator is the number of miles the applicant operated all motor vehicles, railroad cars, locomotives, and airplanes both inside and outside North Carolina during the refund period. The mileage ratio is multiplied by the purchase price of eligible items and then multiplying the resulting product by the tax rate that would have applied to the items if they had all been purchased in North Carolina to determine the carrier's proportional liability. Then, the interstate carrier is entitled to a refund of the excess of the amount of sales and use taxes the carrier paid in North Carolina during the refund period on these items over the applicant's proportional liability for the refund period.

Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Railroad Rolling Stock, Interstate and Common Carrier Purchase, Lease, or Rental Transactions

Depends North Carolina allows an interstate carrier a partial refund of the sales and use taxes paid by it on the purchase in North Carolina of railway cars and locomotives. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.14(a). North Carolina defines the term “interstate carrier” as a person who is engaged in transporting persons or property in interstate commerce for compensation. The secretary prescribes the time periods (e.g., monthly, quarterly, or semiannually) with respect to which refunds an interstate carrier may claim or apply for a refund. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.14(a). For each applicant, the secretary computes the amount to be refunded using a three-step process. First, the secretary determines a “mileage ratio.” (The mileage ratio's numerator is the number of miles the applicant operated all motor vehicles, railroad cars, locomotives, and airplanes in North Carolina during the refund period. Its denominator is the number of miles the applicant operated all motor vehicles, railroad cars, locomotives, and airplanes both inside and outside North Carolina during the refund period.)Second, the secretary determines the applicant's proportional liability for the refund period by multiplying the mileage ratio by the items'purchase price and then multiplying the resulting product by the tax rate that would have applied to the items if they had all been purchased in this State. Third, the secretary refunds to each applicant the excess of the amount of sales and use taxes the applicant paid in this State during the refund period on these items over the applicant's proportional liability for the refund period. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.14(a). Effective June 12, 2018, N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.14(a) was clarified to indicate that qualifying items and services purchased by an interstate carrier must be taxable in North Carolina to be eligible for a refund. N.C. Gen.

Utility Companies' Purchases of Locomotives North Carolina allows a utility company a partial refund of the sales and use taxes paid by it on the purchase in North Carolina of railway cars and locomotives and accessories for a railway car or locomotive that the utility company operates. The secretary prescribes the time periods (e.g., monthly, quarterly, or semiannually) with respect to which a utility company may claim or apply for a refund. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.14(a2).
