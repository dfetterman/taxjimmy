State: New Mexico



Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Food and Food Ingredients General Rule

Depends Generally, receipts from the sale of most staple grocery food items sold by a retail food store are deducted from the gross receipts tax base. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-92(A); New Mexico Bulletin FYI-105. Only qualifying food sold in a qualifying retail food store is eligible for the exemption. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-92(B). A retail food store is an establishment that sells food for home preparation and consumption and that meets the definition of retail food store in 7 U.S.C. 2012(k)(1) for purposes of the federal food stamp program. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-92(B)(2). To qualify as a retail food store, a business must conform to at least one of two criteria set by the federal government. New Mexico Bulletin FYI-201. The first possible criterion is that the retail food store sells food for home preparation and consumption and stock or offers a variety of at least seven foods on a continuous basis in each of four staples food categories. At least three of those categories must contain perishable foods. 7 U.S.C. 2012(o)(1)(A); New Mexico Bulletin FYI-201. The second possible criterion is that the retail store functions as a specialty store that sells food for home preparation and consumption and can attribute 50 percent or more of its total retail sales, including food, non-food, gas, and services, to staple foods. 7 U.S.C. 2012(o)(1)(B); New Mexico Bulletin FYI-201. The four categories of staple foods are as follows:• breads or cereals; • dairy products; • fruits or vegetables; and • meat, fish, or poultry. 7 U.S.C. 2012(q)(1); New Mexico Bulletin FYI-201. Accessory food items, such as coffee, tea, cocoa, carbonated and uncarbonated drinks, candy, condiments, and spices, may not be counted as staple foods. 7 U.S.C. 2012(q)(2). A taxpayer that is authorized to accept food stamps under the federal Food Stamp Act is presumed to be a retail food store for tax periods during which the taxpayer is authorized to accept food stamps. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.240.8(A). A taxpayer who meets the definition of “retail food store” but does not participate in the federal food stamp program may qualify as a retail food store if the secretary certifies that the taxpayer is a retail food store. A taxpayer seeking certification as a “retail food store” must apply. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.240.8(A). A taxpayer who is not authorized to accept food stamps, and has not been certified as a retail food store by the secretary, is presumed not to be a retail food store. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.240.8(B). Certain establishments are generally deemed to be ineligible for the exemption, including (but not limited to):• concessions stands or similar businesses at public or private sporting events or social events, where food is not intended for home consumption; • vending machines; • sidewalk vendors and other open-air vendors at fairs, festivals, and similar events, where food is not intended for home consumption; • stores where the sales of staple goods constitute less than 50 percent of gross retail sales; and • gas stations, convenience stores, and similar business that do no stock a variety of qualifying foods in each of the food categories of staple foods on a continuous basis.
