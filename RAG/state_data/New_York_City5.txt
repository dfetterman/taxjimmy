Tax Law §1101-N.Y. Tax Law §1150. Instead, the characterization of the sale and installation of these items is determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, applying New York's three-part test. See N.Y. Comp.

However, if such installation is performed in a building more than 6 months after the building has otherwise been completed, this constitutes taxable repair, maintenance, or installation.

Depends New York City generally imposes tax on the same sales and services taxed at the state level. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(a)(1); N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2001(a). As a general rule, additions or alterations to real property for or by a tenant with respect to leased premises are presumed to be temporary in nature and, consequently, do not qualify as capital improvements. New York TB-ST-113 (Aug. 7, 2014). However, an alteration or addition to leased property may qualify as a capital improvement if there is an intention to make it permanent and it also meets the other two criteria for a capital improvement described above. For example, an intention of permanence would be demonstrated by a provision in the building lease indicating that immediately upon installation, title to the installation vests with the lessor, and the installed property is to remain with the premises after the termination of the lease.

N.Y. Tax Law §1111(p)(3).
