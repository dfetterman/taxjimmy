Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Prepared Food General Rule

Taxable Gross receipts derived from prepared food are subject to tax at the general rate. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-103(18); Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-301(1); Ark. Code Ann. §26-53-106(a). See also, Rule 2007-3, Special Rules for Sales of Food and Food Ingredients and Prepared Food; Ark. Dept. of Fin. and Admin., “Food and Food Ingredients” State Sales & Use Tax Guide. Arkansas uses a prepared-food sales percentage to determine when making utensils available to customers at a self-service station, or otherwise, constitutes selling food with a utensil provided by the seller, and is taxable at the full state sales and use tax rate as a sale of prepared food. The prepared-food sales percentage is important to sellers that primarily sell prepared food, but also sell items that would generally be considered food and food ingredients. A seller must calculate its prepared-food sales percentage to determine when it is regarded as providing prepared food to its customers, just by making utensils available. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-103(17); Ark. Code Ann. §26-53-102(17);Ark. Dept. of Fin. & Admin., Sales and Use Tax Section, Rule 2007-3, Special Rules for Sales of Food and Food Ingredients and Prepared Food; Ark. Dept. of Fin. and Admin., “Food and Food Ingredients” State Sales & Use Tax Guide. In calculating the ratio, the numerator is determined by adding the sales of prepared food with the number of sales where utensils, plates, bowls, cups, cutlery, are necessary to receive the food. Alcoholic beverages are not included in the numerator. The denominator includes all sales of food and food ingredients, as well as prepared food, candy, soft drinks, and dietary supplements. Again, alcohol is not included within this sum. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-103(17); Ark. Code Ann. §26-53-102(17);Ark. Dept. of Fin. & Admin., Sales and Use Tax Section, Rule 2007-3, Special Rules for Sales of Food and Food Ingredients and Prepared Food; Ark. Dept. of Fin. and Admin., “Food and Food Ingredients” State Sales & Use Tax Guide. If after the calculation is complete the ratio is 75 percent or less, utensils are considered provided to the customer only where it is the vendors practice to physically give, hand, or otherwise deliver, the utensils to the customer. The vendors practice is determined by accepting a good faith representation from the vendor. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-103(17); Ark. Code Ann. §26-53-102(17);Ark. Dept. of Fin. & Admin., Sales and Use Tax Section, Rule 2007-3, Special Rules for Sales of Food and Food Ingredients and Prepared Food; Ark. Dept. of Fin. and Admin., “Food and Food Ingredients” State Sales & Use Tax Guide. If after the calculation is complete the ratio is greater than 75 percent, utensils are considered to be provided so long as utensils are made available to the purchaser. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-103(17); Ark. Code Ann. §26-53-102(17);Ark. Dept. of Fin. & Admin., Sales and Use Tax Section, Rule 2007-3, Special Rules for Sales of Food and Food Ingredients and Prepared Food; Ark. Dept. of Fin. and Admin., “Food and Food Ingredients” State Sales & Use Tax Guide. For vendors who have a ratio of greater than 75 percent who sell items containing four or more servings packaged as one and sold for one price, the mere availability of utensils does not make such food prepared food. Rather, if the vendor provides utensils directly for use in consuming the food item, then the food is considered prepared food, and subject to tax as such. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-103(17); Ark. Code Ann. §26-53-102(17);Ark. Dept. of Fin. & Admin., Sales and Use Tax Section, Rule 2007-3, Special Rules for Sales of Food and Food Ingredients and Prepared Food; Ark. Dept. of Fin. and Admin., “Food and Food Ingredients” State Sales & Use Tax Guide. Prepared food is subject to the state of Arkansas gross receipts and compensating use tax. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-103(18); Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-301(1); Ark. Code Ann. §26-53-106(a); Ark. Dept. of Fin. and Admin., “Food and Food Ingredients” State Sales & Use Tax Guide. The local sales and use taxes apply to the same base as the state sales and use tax. Ark. Code Ann. §26-74-212(a); Ark. Code Ann. §26-74-407; Ark. Code Ann. §26-75-207(e); Ark. Code Ann. §26-75-312(a); Ark. Code Ann. §26-75-502(a); Ark. Code Ann. §26-73-113(a)(1)(A). Therefore, prepared food is subject to the local sales and use tax. Prepared food provided by an independent contractor, to an exempt entity is exempt from sales and use tax. The independent contractor's purchases to prepare the food are also exempt from sales and use tax, under the sale-for-resale exemption.

Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Vending Machines

Taxable In lieu of the state or local gross receipts taxes that would otherwise apply, Arkansas law provides for a vending devices sales tax applicable to vending machine sales by persons who have elected to register with the director as vending device operators. Ark. Code Ann. §26-57-1002(a); Ark. Code Ann. §26-57-1002(d). A 5.5-percent tax is imposed on the purchase price, minus any applicable manufacturer's rebates, of all tangible personal property purchased or withdrawn from inventory during each calendar month by a vending device operator for resale through a vending device. Ark. Code Ann. §26-57-1002(d); Ark. Code Ann. §26-57-1002(f). The 5.5-percent tax includes a one percent tax that is levied in lieu of any local gross receipts tax. Ark. Code Ann. §26-57-1002(d)(2). A vending device operator is any person selling tangible personal property through a vending device, which is any machine or manual device that dispenses tangible personal property after a coin or other thing of value is inserted. Devices that are used exclusively for the purpose of selling cigarettes, newspapers, magazines, or postage stamps are not regarded as vending devices for purposes of this tax. Ark. Code Ann. §26-57-1001(3); Ark. Code Ann. §26-57-1001(4). Those who elect to pay the vending devices sales tax are required to register for a gross receipts tax permit under the same process that applies to the general gross receipts tax. Ark. Code Ann. §26-57-1002(b). The tax is also reported and paid in the same manner and at the same time as prescribed for the gross receipts tax. Ark. Code Ann. §26-57-1002(e). If the vending device operator is also the manufacturer of the products sold, the tax is imposed on the selling price for which the product would be sold to another vendor for resale through a vending device. Ark. Code Ann. §26-57-1002(g). A person may elect not to register as a vending device operator; however, if this election is made, the person must surrender any gross receipts tax permits issued, unless the permit is need to report taxable sales other than those made through a vending device. In addition, sales of tangible personal property intended to be resold through the vending machine will not be eligible for the sale for resale exemption from sales or use tax. Therefore, those who do not register as vending device operators, but continue to make sales through vending machines, must pay sales or use tax on purchases of inventory to be sold through the vending machine. If the sales and use tax is paid, the subsequent sale through the vending machine is not subject to tax. Ark. Code Ann. §26-57-1003. Any person who makes sales through vending devices must affix the name and any applicable identification number of the person responsible for the payment of tax. If the vending device does not have this information affixed, there is a presumption that the tax has not been paid. Under this presumption, vending devices will be sealed to prevent further sales and a $50 per vending device penalty will be assessed against the person making the sales. The presumption may be overcome by affixing the required information and providing proof that the tax was paid. Ark. Code Ann. §26-57-1004. BNA-SUTN AR 11.9.
