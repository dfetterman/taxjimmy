Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §139.105(1)(a)(2). • Delivery Address Unknown: If the retailer of a product does not know the address where the tangible personal property or service is received, the sale is sourced to the first address listed in this paragraph that is known to the retailer: o the purchaser's address; Ky.

Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §139.105(1)(a)(3)(d). Digital Property Effective July 1, 2011 digital property is no longer sourced using the principles discussed below. Instead, retailers must source digital goods according to the sourcing rules for tangible personal property as discussed above. 2011 Ky. H.B. 429.

Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §139.105(3). To the extent a retailer could not source the retail sale of digital property to the place of primary use, the retailer should source the sale as follows:• When the product was received by the purchaser at a business location of the retailer, the sale should be sourced to that business location. 103 Ky.

Admin. Regs. 31:310(2)(2)(2010). • When neither of the two above directives applied, the sale should be sourced to the location indicated by an address for the purchaser that is available from the business records of the retailer that are maintained in the ordinary course of the retailer's business when use of this address does not constitute bad faith. 103 Ky. Admin. Regs. 31:310(2)(3)(2010). • When none of the three above directives applied, the sale should be sourced to the location indicated by an address for the purchaser obtained during the consummation of the sale, including the address of a purchaser's payment instrument, if no other address is available, when the use of this address does not constitute bad faith. 103 Ky. Admin. Regs. 31:310(2)(4)(2010). • When none of the four above directives applied, including the circumstance in which the retailer is without sufficient information to apply the previous rules, then the location should be determined by the address from which the digital good was first available for transmission by the retailer (disregarding any location that merely provided the digital transfer of the product sold). 103 Ky. Admin. Regs. §31:310(2)(5)(2010).
