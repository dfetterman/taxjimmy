Topic: Administration and Procedure Agencies Responsible for Administration Local Sales and Use Tax

Utah State Tax Commission The Utah State Tax Commission has been given exclusive authority to administer, collect, and enforce all sales and use taxes enacted by its localities. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-118(1); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-202; Utah Code Ann. §59-12-403(4)(a)(i) and (ii); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-703(4)(a)(i))(A) and (B); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-802(4)(a)(i)(A); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-1102(4)(a)(i)(A); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-1302(6)(a) and (b); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-1803(4)(a) and (b); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-2206(1) and (2). Administration of these local taxes is to be in accordance with either the standard tax collection procedures or the local sales and use tax procedures and general taxing procedures. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-118(1); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-202; Utah Code Ann. §59-12-403(4)(a)(i) and (ii); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-703(4)(a)(i))(A) and (B); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-802(4)(a)(i)(A); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-1102(4)(a)(i)(A); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-1302(6)(a) and (b); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-1803(4)(a) and (b); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-2206(1) and (2). Distribution of the Local Sales and Use Tax Distribution of the funds from the state to its localities differs based on each individual tax component. Each county will receive a distribution of the local sales and use tax component equal to the greater of the calculated distribution formula or the minimum tax revenue distribution payment. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-205(4)(b)(i)(A), Utah Code Ann. §59-12-205(4)(b)(i)(B). If the locality receives a distribution based on the calculated distribution formula for three consecutive fiscal years, then the localities payment for the immediate subsequent fiscal year will be equal to the calculated distribution formula for that year. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-205(4)(b)(ii). The formula distribution payment comprises two 50 percent parts. Fifty percent of each dollar collected from the this sales and use tax component is allocated to each county, city, and town based on the percentage that the population of the county, city, or town bears to the total population of all counties, cities, and towns in the state. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-205(2)(a). The other 50 percent collected is paid to county, city, town, or military installation development authority based on the location that the transaction was consummated. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-205(2)(b)(i); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-205(2)(b)(ii). A minimum tax revenue distribution is defined as the greater of the total amount of tax revenue distributions an eligible county, city, or town receives from a local sales and use tax imposed for fiscal year 2000-2001; or the total amount of tax revenue distributions an eligible county, city, or town receives from a tax imposed for fiscal year 2004-2005 until fiscal year 2012-2013. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-205(4)(a)(ii)(A); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-205(4)(a)(ii)(B). However, starting fiscal year 2013-14 through fiscal year 2015-16, a locality will receive a minimum tax distribution if their 2012-13 distribution payment is less than or equal to the minimum tax revenue distribution payment times 90 percent. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-205(4)(c)(i); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-205(4)(c)(ii). Distribution of the County Option Tax The distribution of the county option tax also uses a special formula. All net amounts earned by the counties, after taking into account the administrative fees, are distributed to each county based on a formula determined by the aggregate population of counties that impose this tax to the total state population. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-1102(3)(a); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-1102(3)(b). If the aggregate population of counties imposing this tax is less than 75 percent of the total state population, then the county receives all of its amounts collected, less the state administrative fee Utah Code Ann. §59-12-1102(3)(a). However, if the aggregate population of counties enacting this tax equals or exceeds 75 percent of the total state population, then the county enacting this tax receives 50 percent of the tax collected within the county and also receives a proportional share of the remaining tax collected by all counties that enacted this tax based on the county population. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-1102(3)(b)(i); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-1102(3)(b)(ii). Regardless, the total amount the county receives may not be less than $75,000 annually. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-1102(3)(c). Adjustments are made to correct any underpayments. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-1102(3)(c)(i); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-1102(3)(c)(ii). If the county tax was imposed by the state because the county had not yet enacted the county option sales and use tax, then any remaining amounts after removal of the state administrative fee, are not distributed to the county, but instead deposited into the state general fund. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-1802(4). Distribution of the Other Local Tax Components Amounts received for most taxes other than local sales and use or county option tax are to be distributed through electronic funds transfer on a monthly basis less the Utah State Tax Commission's fee to the county, city, or town that the sale or purchase is sourced to and that has enacted the tax. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-403(4)(a); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-403(4)(b); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-704(8); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-802(4)(a); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-804(4)(a); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-1302(6)(c); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-2103(4); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-2206(4). No allocation to other jurisdictions is permitted. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-403(4)(b); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-802(4)(b); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-804(4)(b); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-1302(7); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-2103(5)(b); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-2206(3). Alternatively, revenues may be distributed directly to the locality's public transit district instead of the city or town for local option taxes to fund a system for public transit, airport facilities, or highways, if the locality files a proper request with the state. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-2206(5); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-2219, as amended by 2016 Utah H.B. 183, effective Jan. 1, 2017 (discussing distribution of revenue for highways and public transit). Only the local sales and use tax; local option tax for counties, cities, and towns; and resort community tax and additional resort community tax revenues may be used by the localities for general funding. Any revenue raised from the other local option taxes that a locality may impose must be used for a specified purpose, and may not be used for general funding. For example, after the county and cities receive their option rural medical facilities taxes, they are required to distribute all the tax revenues they received for those taxes on a quarterly basis to either county medical facilities located within the county for which the county taxes were received, or to the city hospital located within the city that the tax is sourced. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-803(1); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-805(1). If multiple facilities are located within the county or city, then the county or city legislative body will determine how the revenues are distributed. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-803(2); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-805(2). Similarly, botanical, cultural, recreational, and zoological taxes are distributed throughout the county to support specific activities based on a specified formula. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-704(1), as amended by 2016 Utah S.B. 137, effective Jan. 1, 2017 (discussing distribution of revenue based on the primary purpose of the zoological facility). The Tax Commission is also responsible for adjudicating of any sales and use tax controversy through an administrative hearing and representing of any county, city, or town during an administrative hearing. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-118(2) and (3). The Utah State Tax Commission collects all the local option sales and use taxes, charging the locality for its service and remitting to the locality the balance through monthly electronic fund payments. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-206(1); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-401(2)(a); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-402(2)(a); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-403(4)(a)(i); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-703(4)(a)(i)(A); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-802(5); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-804(5); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-1102(4)(c); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-1302(7); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-1403(2); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-2206(1); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-2207.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Good Faith Requirement

Yes If an individual or business entity sells tangible personal property, and does not collect sales or use tax because the purchaser has presented to them an apparently valid exemption certificate, then the person or business will not be held liable for the unpaid sales or use tax. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-106(3)(d); Utah Publication No. 25. However, vendors will be liable for unpaid sales or use tax when the vendor:• knew or had reason to know at the time the purchaser provided the seller or certified service provider with an exemption certificate that the information related to the exemption claimed was materially false;or • otherwise knowingly participated in activity intended to purposefully evade the tax due on the transaction. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-106(3)(e). An exemption certificate is taken in good faith if the exemption certificate claims an exemption that:• was allowed by statute on the date of the transaction in the jurisdiction of the location of the transaction; • could be applicable to the transaction; and • is reasonable for the purchaser's type of business. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-106(3)(c)(iii), as amended by 2014 Utah H.B. 35. BNA-SUTN UT 31.8.4.

Utah Publication No. 4. After the Voluntary Disclosure Program staff has received the company's offer to enter into a voluntary disclosure agreement, the facts and circumstances will be reviewed. If the Voluntary Disclosure Program staff recommends acceptance of an offer, an official agreement will be prepared for final approval and authorizing signatures. An offer can be denied at this stage. If there are any material misrepresentations in information received in support of the agreement, the Utah State Tax Commission may consider the agreement void and assess additional tax, penalty and interest. When the Utah State Tax Commission has approved the agreement, it will be forwarded to the company's representative. The company will have 30 days to execute the agreement and provide the requested information, registration, returns and schedules. If an offer is denied, a letter will be sent to the company's representative. The company will remain anonymous throughout the process until the agreement is signed. Utah Publication No. 4. Once the agreement has been signed and an assessment has been issued, the company will have 30 days to pay the assessment. If payment is not received within 30 days, a penalty for failure to pay the tax will automatically be imposed and interest will continue to accrue. Utah Publication No. 4. BNA-SUTN UT 31.15.1.

If a company's presence is limited, the tax commission may enter into an agreement for a period of less than three years or for prospective compliance. Utah Publication No. 4. The length of the disclosure period (the period of time the company will be required to pay back taxes) depends on the nature of the company's activities in Utah. If tax has been collected from customers or withheld from employees and the company has not remitted the tax, the Tax Commission will require all of the tax collected or withheld to be remitted. Interest on prior tax liabilities is included in the calculation of amounts due under the voluntary disclosure agreement. Utah Publication No. 4. BNA-SUTN UT 31.15.2.
