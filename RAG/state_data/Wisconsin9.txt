Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

True Object If a transaction, other than a bundled transaction, involves the transfer of tangible personal property along with the performance of a nontaxable service, the true objective of the purchaser determines whether the transaction is a sale of tangible personal property or the performance of a nontaxable service with the transfer of property being merely incidental to the performance of the service. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.67(1). If a transaction involves the transfer of tangible personal property and performance of nontaxable services and the true objective of the purchaser is the tangible personal property, tax applies to the total sales price without any deduction for the services performed in conjunction with the sale. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.67(2)(b). Moreover, tangible personal property transferred in conjunction with a service is not considered incidental, and thus, is subject to tax, if the service provider charges a separate and optional fee for such property, items, or goods. Wis. Stat. §77.51(5), as amended by 2017 Wis. S.B. 89, § 16, effective June 23, 2017. BNA-SUTN WI 9.3.1.

Depends The entire sales price of a bundled transaction is generally subject to tax, unless the retailer can identify the portion of the price that is attributable to products that are not subject sales tax, then that portion of the sales price is not taxable. Wis. Stat. §77.52(20)(a) - (b); see also Wisconsin Tax Bulletin No. 201 - Tax Releases. The retailer must be able to identify nontaxable products by reasonable and verifiable standards from the retailer's books and records that are kept in the ordinary course of its business for other purposes. However, separating the nontaxable from taxable does not apply to bundled transactions that contain food and food ingredients, drugs, durable medical equipment, mobility enhancing equipment, prosthetic devices, or medical supplies. Wis. Stat. §77.52(20)(b). A “bundled transaction”is the retail sale of two or more products, not including real property and services to real property, if the products are distinct and identifiable products and sold for one nonitemized price.

Code Tax § 11.985(1)(a)(2)(a). • the retail sale of tangible personal property and a service, if the tangible personal property is essential to the use of the service, and provided exclusively in connection with the service, and if the true object of the transaction is the service; Wis.

Stat. §77.51(1f)(b)(2); Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.985(1)(a)(2)(c). • the retail sale of services, if one of the services is essential to the use or receipt of another service, and provided exclusively in connection with the other service, and if the true object of the transaction is the other service; Wis.

Code Tax § 11.985(1)(a)(2)(d). • a transaction that includes taxable and nontaxable products, if the seller's purchase price or the sales price of the taxable products is no greater than 10 percent of the seller's total purchase price or sales price of all the bundled products, as determined by the seller using either the seller's purchase price or sales price, but not a combination of both, or, in the case of a service contract, the full term of the service contract; Wis. Stat. §77.51(1f)(d); Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.985(1)(a)(2)(e). or • the retail sale of taxable and exempt property if the transaction includes food and food ingredients, drugs, durable medical equipment, mobility-enhancing equipment, prosthetic devices, or medical supplies, and if the seller's purchase price is no greater than 50 percent of the seller's total purchase price or sales price of all the tangible personal property included in what would otherwise be a bundled transaction.
