In order to qualify for the exclusion, the proposed project must provide both fiscal and environmental benefits to California. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6010.8, as amended by 2018 Cal. A.B. 1547, effective Sept. 21, 2018 (extending exclusion to contractors); California Tax Publication 542—Edition 4; see California Legislative Analysts Office, Evaluation of a Sales Tax Exemption For Certain Manufacturers. Applications are evaluated based on the following factors:• the extent to which the project develops manufacturing facilities or purchases equipment for manufacturing facilities located within California; Cal.

Contractors Effective Sept. 21, 2018, the exclusion extends to purchases by contractors of property for use as an integral party of an approved project. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6010.8, as amended by 2018 Cal. A.B. 1547, effective Sept. 21, 2018. Prior to Sept. 21, 2018, the exclusion from sales and use tax only applied to tangible personal property transferred to the participating party. Contractors could not issue exemption certificates claiming the advanced manufacturing exclusion. In order to utilize the exclusion, a construction contract for the furnishing and installation of materials must be structured so that title of the materials passes directly to the participating party before any taxable use occurs. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6010.8, as amended by 2018 Cal. A.B. 1547, effective Sept. 21, 2018; Cal Dept. of Tax & Fee Admin., CAEATFA Sales and Use Exclusion; see Cal. Public Resources Code § 26011.8(a); California Tax Publication 542—Edition 4. Prior to Sept. 21, 2018, contracts should be written to sell the materials used and to install the materials sold and should separately state the sales price of the materials from the charges for labor and installation. This requires:• the contractor to be in the business of selling materials or other tangible personal property; • the contract to possess a valid seller's permit; • the contract to explicitly provide for the transfer of title to the materials prior to installation; and • the contract to separately state the price of materials from the charges for labor and installation. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6010.8, as amended by 2018 Cal. A.B. 1547, effective Sept. 21, 2018; Cal Dept. of Tax & Fee Admin., CAEATFA Sales and Use Exclusion; see Cal. Public Resources Code § 26011.8(a); California Tax Publication 542—Edition 4. Prior to Sept. 21, 2018, if the requirements were met, the contractor may purchase the materials as tax-exempt items for resale. The participating party may then issue an exemption certificate claiming the exclusion for alternative energy sources. Otherwise, the contractor must pay tax on the purchases of materials for a qualifying advanced manufacturing project. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6010.8, as amended by 2018 Cal. A.B. 1547, effective Sept. 21, 2018; Cal Dept. of Tax & Fee Admin., CAEATFA Sales and Use Exclusion; see Cal. Public Resources Code § 26011.8(a); California Tax Publication 542—Edition 4.
