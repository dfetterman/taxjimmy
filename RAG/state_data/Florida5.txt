The Florida Department of Revenue may determine the taxable portion of a total rent payment when, in a lease of real property, there are multiple uses of such property, and a portion of the property is subject to the tax, while another portion is not subject to the tax. Taxpayers may apportion the portions of a lease involving different uses by using square footage information. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.070(14)(a); Florida Technical Assistance Advisement 19A-002 (Jan. 25, 2019); Florida Technical Assistance Advisement 17A-015 (Aug. 15, 2017). Generally, a determination whether an agreement constitutes a license can be established based on the allocation of the economic risk of loss to the parties to the agreement. In most cases, with a license for the use of real property, the licensee receives a license for the use of a location in order to run its business. The business is run by the licensee, who bears the risk of loss in that business, paying the licensor no matter what the result of the business operations. The payment may be a flat fee or a percentage of profits, but it is the licensee who earns the profits and pays something over to the licensor. Florida Technical Assistance Advisement 18A-009 (May 16, 2018) (where vendors make sales on the premises of a taxpayer's full-service food hall, and the taxpayer retains portions of their sales receipts, vendors have a taxable license to use real property); Florida Technical Assistance Advisement 18A-006 (April 10, 2018). The determination also looks to the goals of the parties in entering into the agreement.

Port Authority Property Property used at a port authority exclusively for the purpose of loading, or unloading passengers or cargo onto or from such a vessel is exempt from the tax on renting real property. Fla. Stat. §212.031(1)(a)(8)(a); Florida Technical Assistance Advisement 17A-015 (Aug. 15, 2017). Property Rented for Concessionaire Services Leasing, subleasing, licensing, or renting to a person providing food and drink concessionaire services within the premises of a convention hall, exhibition hall, auditorium, stadium, theater, arena, civic center, performing arts center, or publicly owned recreational facility is exempt from sales and use tax.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal General Rule for Classification

Depends Fixtures are included in the definition of “real property” and are thus not subject to sales or use tax. Fla. Stat. §212.02(10)(h); Fla. Stat. §212.06(14)(a); Fla. Stat. §212.05. However, renting, leasing, letting or granting a license for use of any real property is subject to sales and use tax, subject to certain exceptions. Fla. Stat. §212.031(1)(a). The term “fixtures”means items that are an accessory to a building, other structure, or land and that do not lose their identity as accessories when installed but that do become permanently attached to realty. Fla. Stat. §212.06(14)(b). “Fixtures”include wired lighting, kitchen or bathroom sinks, furnaces, central air conditioning units, elevators or escalators, or built-in cabinets, counters or lockers. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.051(2)(c)(1). However, the term does not include the following items, whether or not such items are attached to real property in a permanent manner; property of a type that is required to be registered, licensed, titled, or documented by this state or by the U.S. government, including, but not limited to, mobile homes, except mobile homes assessed as real property, or industrial machinery or equipment. Fla. Stat. §212.06(14)(b). Determining whether an item is a fixture depends on a review of all the facts and circumstances of each situation. Among the relevant factors that determine whether a particular item is a fixture are the following: • the method of attachment; Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.051(2)(c)(3)(a); see also Florida Technical Assistance Advisement 17A-018 (Aug. 30, 2017). • intent of the property holder in having the item attached; Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.051(2)(c)(3)(b). • real property law determinations; Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.051(2)(c)(3)(c). • customization of the items; Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.051(2)(c)(3)(d). • permits and licensing requirements; Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.051(2)(c)(3)(e). and • legal agreements. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.051(2)(c)(3)(f). For an item to be considered a fixture, the owner of the item does not need to also own the real property to which it is attached. Fla. Stat. §212.06(14)(b). BNA-SUTN FL 28.2.1.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Construction Materials and Contracts Construction Materials and Contracts, Generally

Nontaxable Charges for construction labor billed to a contractee are not subject to sales and use tax in Florida. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.051; Florida Standard Industry Guide - Construction/Real Property Contractor (Jan. 2011). However, contractors must pay tax on the costs of materials and supplies used on real property contracts unless the contractor is engaged in a retail sale plus installation contract. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.051(4); see Florida Technical Assistance Advisement 15A-019 (Nov. 23, 2015). Contractors performing lump-sum, cost plus or fixed fee, upset or guaranteed price, and time and materials contracts do not resell the tangible personal property used to perform the contracts to the real property owner, but instead use the property themselves to provide the completed real property improvement. These contractors should pay tax to their suppliers on all purchases, and pay tax on all materials they fabricate for their own use in performing such contracts. Moreover, these contractors are not to charge their customers tax regardless of whether the invoices itemize materials and labor charges. Such contractors should not register as dealers unless they are required to remit tax on the fabricated cost of items they fabricate to use in performing contracts. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.051(4). Lump-Sum Contracts A lump-sum contract is a contract in which a contractor or subcontractor agrees to furnish materials and supplies and necessary services for a single stated lump-sum price. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.051(3)(a); Florida Final Order DOR 2010-07-FOF (Nov. 8, 2010); see also Florida Technical Assistance Advisement 17A-018 (Aug. 30, 2017) (if a customer does not obtain the title to property and assume the risk of loss until items are attached as fixtures, this will constitute evidence of a lump-sum contract). Examples of Lump-sum Contracts Cost Plus or Fixed Fee Contracts These are contracts in which the contractor or subcontractor agrees to furnish the materials and supplies and necessary services in exchange for reimbursement of costs plus a fee that is fixed in advance or calculated as a percentage of the costs. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.051(3)(b). Upset or Guaranteed Price Contracts These are contracts in which the contractor or subcontractor agrees to furnish materials and supplies and necessary services based on costs plus fees, but with an upset or guaranteed maximum price that may not be exceeded. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.051(3)(c). Time and Materials Contracts These are contracts in which the contractor or subcontractor agrees to furnish materials and supplies and necessary services for a price that will be calculated as the sum of the contractor's cost or a marked up cost for materials to be used plus an amount for services to be based on the time spent performing the contract. These contracts are similar to cost plus or fixed fee contracts, because the final price to the property holder will be determined based on the cost of performance. A time and materials contract may or may not also have a guaranteed or upset price clause. Time and materials contracts differ from retail sale plus installation contracts, because the materials are not completely identified, itemized, and priced in the contract in advance and because the property owner is contracting for a finished job rather than the purchase of materials. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.051(3)(e). Retail Sale Plus Installation Contracts In contrast to the taxability rule applicable to the types of contracts listed above (i.e., lump-sum, cost plus or fixed fee, upset or guaranteed price, and time and materials contracts), contractors performing retail sale plus installation contracts do sell tangible personal property and should register as dealers. Such contractors are required to provide a resale exemption certificate to the selling dealer to purchase tax exempt materials that are itemized and resold under their retail sale plus installation contracts. They must charge their customers tax on the price paid for tangible personal property but not on installation labor charges. However, such contractors are not to provide a resale exemption certificate for items they use themselves rather than reselling, such as hand tools, shop equipment, or office supplies. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.051(5). A retail sale plus installation contract is a contract for improvements to real property in which the contractor or subcontractor agrees to sell specifically described and itemized materials and supplies at an agreed price or at the regular retail price, and to complete the work either for an additional agreed price or on the basis of time consumed. For a contract to fit in this category, all the materials that will be incorporated into the work must be itemized and priced in the contract before work begins. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.051(3)(d). If a contract itemizes some materials, but does not itemize other materials that will be incorporated into the work, the contract is not included in this category. Because the sale of the materials is a separable transaction from the installation, the purchaser must assume title to and risk of loss of the materials and supplies as they are delivered, rather than accepting title only to the completed work. The contractor may remain liable for negligence in handling and installing the items. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.051(3)(d);see also Florida Technical Assistance Advisement 17A-018 (Aug. 30, 2017) (if a customer does not obtain the title to property and assume the risk of loss until items are attached as fixtures, this will constitute evidence of a lump-sum contract). Mixed Contracts A real property contract may also include materials and labor that are not real property improvements. A contract that includes both real property work and tangible personal property is referred to as a mixed contract. A mixed contract is one that involves a real property improvement, maintenance, or repair and also involves providing tangible personal property that remains tangible personal property and does not become part of the real property. In the case of a mixed contract, taxability depends upon the predominant nature of the work performed under the contract and upon the contract terms. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.051(8). If the predominant nature of a mixed contract is a contract for real property improvements, taxability will be determined as if the contract was entirely for real property. For example, a residential developer routinely provides some items of tangible personal property, such as free standing appliances, with new homes sold under cost-plus contracts. The predominant nature of the contract is for a dwelling. The developer should pay sales or use tax on the appliances. A contractor who constructs a factory under a turnkey contract that includes providing and installing machinery and equipment is not exempt from sales and use tax. The contract is predominantly for a factory, a real property improvement, and the contractor should pay use tax on the cost of the machinery and equipment. No tax is collected from the property owner in either case, even though some tangible personal property is included in the project. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.051(8)(a); see also Florida Technical Assistance Advisement 14A-011 (April 23, 2014). If the predominant nature of a mixed contract is a contract for tangible personal property, taxability of the contract will be determined as if the contract were entirely for tangible personal property. For example, a vendor of a mechanical conveyor system for a warehouse provides reinforced concrete foundations and embeds steel plates in the concrete to permit installation of the equipment by bolting it to the plates. The contract is predominantly for the sale of equipment. The contractor should buy the equipment, concrete, and steel plates tax exempt by extending a copy of the contractor's Annual Resale Certificate (Form DR-13) to the selling dealer and charge tax on the full price charged to the customer. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.051(8)(b); see also Florida Technical Assistance Advisement 14A-011 (April 23, 2014). The determination of the predominant nature of a contract will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Consideration will be given to the description of the project and the responsibilities of the contractor as set forth in the contract. Consideration will also be given to the relative cost of performance of the real property and tangible personal property components of the contract. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.051(8)(c); see also Florida Technical Assistance Advisement 14A-011 (April 23, 2014). If a mixed contract clearly allocates the contract price among the various elements of the contract, and such allocation is bona fide and reasonable in terms of the costs of materials and nature of the work to be performed, taxation will be according to the allocation. For example, a residential developer builds and sells a home on a cost plus basis, but the contract provides separately stated prices for the sale and installation of certain optional free standing appliances that are tangible personal property and are not classified as real property fixtures. The contractor may purchase those appliances by issuing a copy of the contractor's Annual Resale Certificate (Form DR-13) to the selling dealer and charge sales tax on the price paid for the appliances, including installation, by the home buyer. The contractor is responsible for paying tax on all the materials that are included in the cost plus price of the home, other than the separately itemized appliances. Similarly, a manufacturer who sells and installs a mechanical conveyor system in a warehouse could state a separate charge in the contract for providing reinforced concrete with embedded steel plates in the warehouse floor to support the conveyor. The conveyor system is machinery or equipment and is therefore tangible personal property. The concrete and plates would be considered a real property improvement. The contractor should pay tax on the materials used for the real property part of the contract and not charge tax to the customer on the related charge. The customer should pay tax on the rest of the contract price allocable to the conveyor machinery itself. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.051(8)(d); see also Florida Technical Assistance Advisement 14A-011 (April 23, 2014). Self-produced Construction Materials and Items Contractors that self-produce construction materials generally must pay use tax based on the fabricated cost of the materials. Fla. Stat. §212.06(1)(b); Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.051(4). However, contractors that manufacture and install factory-built buildings are subject to use tax only on the cost price of items that they use to manufacture the buildings. Fla. Stat. §212.06(1)(b). Similarly, contractors that self-produce asphalt are only required to pay use tax on the cost, including transportation costs, of materials incorporated into the asphalt. Fla. Stat. §212.06(1)(c); Florida Tax Information Publication 18A01-11 (June 19, 2018); Florida Tax Information Publication 17A01-06 (June 13, 2017). Manufactured Asphalt In addition to the regular sales and use tax rate imposed on asphalt manufactured by contractors for their own use, there is an index tax imposed on such asphalt. Fla. Stat. §212.06(1)(c)(2), as amended by 2016 Fla. H.B. 7099, §11, effective July 1, 2016; Florida Tax Information Publication 18A01-11 (June 19, 2018); Florida Tax Information Publication 17A01-06. The indexed tax is adjusted on July 1 of each year, using a producer price index published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. Fla. Stat. §212.06(1)(c)(2), as amended by 2016 Fla. H.B. 7099, §11, effective July 1, 2016. For the period July 1, 2019, through June 30, 2020, the tax on asphalt is $0.81 per ton. Florida Tax Information Publication 19A01-06 (June 25, 2019). The tax rate used by contractors who manufacture and use asphalt from July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019 is $0.77 cents per ton. Fla. Stat. §212.06(1)(c)(2), as amended by 2016 Fla. H.B. 7099, §11, effective July 1, 2016; see Florida Tax Information Publication 18A01-11 (June 19, 2018) (stating that the indexed tax on asphalt for use is $0.77 per ton from July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2019; Florida Tax Information Publication 17A01-06 (June 13, 2017) (stating that the indexed tax on asphalt for use is $0.75 per ton from July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2018); Florida Tax Information Publication 16A01-04 (June 9, 2016) (stating that the indexed tax on asphalt for use is $0.75 per ton from July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2017); Florida Dept. of Rev., 2016 POST-Legislative Review (July 2016). To calculate use tax on asphalt manufactured by a contractor for his or her use: • multiply the cost of all materials that become ingredients of the finished asphalt by 6 percent plus applicable discretionary sales surtax; plus, • multiply the cost of transporting such ingredients to the plant site by 6 percent plus the applicable discretionary sales surtax; plus, • multiply each ton of asphalt manufactured by the indexed tax. The indexed tax is in addition to all taxes paid on purchases of overhead items, including boiler fuels. Fla. Stat. §212.06(1)(c)(2), as amended by 2016 Fla. H.B. 7099, §11, effective July 1, 2016; see also Florida Tax Information Publication 18A01-11 (June 19, 2018) (stating that the indexed tax on asphalt for use is $0.77 per ton from July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2019; Florida Tax Information Publication 17A01-06 (June 13, 2017) (stating that the indexed tax on asphalt is $0.75 per ton from July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2018); Florida Tax Information Publication 16A01-04 (June 9, 2016) (stating that the indexed tax on asphalt is $0.75 per ton from July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2017); Florida Dept. of Rev., 2016 POST-Legislative Review (July 2016).

Depends Materials charges billed to a contractee under a separated construction contract are not subject to sales and use tax in Florida, unless the contractor is engaged in a retail sale plus installation contract. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.051(4), (5); see Florida Technical Assistance Advisement 15A-019 (Nov. 23, 2015). Retail Sale Plus Installation Contracts In contrast to the taxability rule applicable to other types of contracts (i.e., lump-sum, cost plus or fixed fee, upset or guaranteed price, and time and materials contracts), contractors performing retail sale plus installation contracts do sell tangible personal property and should register as dealers. Such contractors are required to provide a resale exemption certificate to the selling dealer to purchase tax exempt materials that are itemized and resold under their retail sale plus installation contracts. They must charge their customers tax on the price paid for tangible personal property but not on installation labor charges. However, such contractors are not to provide a resale exemption certificate for items they use themselves rather than reselling, such as hand tools, shop equipment, or office supplies. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.051(5). A retail sale plus installation contract is a contract for improvements to real property in which the contractor or subcontractor agrees to sell specifically described and itemized materials and supplies at an agreed price or at the regular retail price, and to complete the work either for an additional agreed price or on the basis of time consumed. For a contract to fit in this category, all the materials that will be incorporated into the work must be itemized and priced in the contract before work begins. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.051(3)(d). If a contract itemizes some materials, but does not itemize other materials that will be incorporated into the work, the contract is not included in this category. Because the sale of the materials is a separable transaction from the installation, the purchaser must assume title to and risk of loss of the materials and supplies as they are delivered, rather than accepting title only to the completed work. The contractor may remain liable for negligence in handling and installing the items. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.051(3)(d);see also Florida Technical Assistance Advisement 17A-018 (Aug. 30, 2017) (if a customer does not obtain the title to property and assume the risk of loss until items are attached as fixtures, this will constitute evidence of a lump-sum contract).

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Contractor Classifications

Defined Generally, a “contractor” is in the business of making improvements and/or repairs to real property or to tangible personal property or both. “Improvements” usually consists of building a permanent structure on unimproved land, while repairs are made to existing structures. Florida Standard Industry Guide - Construction/Real Property Contractor (Jan. 2011). A general contractor will typically enter into a contract (referred to as the prime contract)with the owner of the property to be improved and oversee the entire project, performing anywhere from a majority to none of the actual work. The portion of the work the general contractor does not perform will be “subbed” out to a qualified subcontractor. In these instances, the general contractor will enter into subcontracts with the subcontractors. Florida Standard Industry Guide - Construction/Real Property Contractor (Jan. 2011). “Defense Contractor”is a contractor who performs work for the federal government. Fla. Stat. §212.08(17); Florida Standard Industry Guide - Construction/Real Property Contractor (Jan. 2011). Defense contractors may be afforded federal tax immunity, thereby exempting them from Florida State taxation. Fla.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Contracts with Exempt Entities

Depends Sales made to the U.S. government, a state, or any local jurisdiction or political subdivision, are exempt from tax when payment is made directly to the dealer by the governmental entity. Fla. Stat. §212.08(6)(a). However, this exemption does not include sales of tangible personal property made to contractors employed directly to or as agents of any such government or political subdivision when the property goes into or becomes a part of public works owned by the government or political subdivision. Fla. Stat. §212.08(6)(b); Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.094(2). For sales of tangible personal property that go into or become part of public works owned by a governmental entity, other than the federal government, to be exempt, the governmental entity claiming the exemption must certify to the dealer and the contractor the entity's claim to the exemption by providing a certificate of entitlement to the exemption for such sales. Fla. Stat. §212.08(6)(b); Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.094(4)(c). The Department of Revenue also considers certain other criteria in determining whether a governmental entity or a contractor purchased materials. These criteria include whether the governmental entity:• issued its purchase order directly to the vendor supplying the materials and provided the vendor with a copy of the governmental entity's Florida Consumer's Certification of Exemption; • received the vendor's invoice directly, rather than it being issued to the contractor; • paid the vendor directly from public funds; • took title to the tangible personal property from the vendor upon the purchase;and • assumed the risk of damage or loss. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.094(4)(b); see also Florida Technical Assistance Advisement 17A-020 (Oct. 10, 2017) (for the exemption to apply, a taxpayer must change proposed contract language so that it is directly invoiced); Florida Technical Assistance Advisement 14A-002 (Feb. 4, 2014); Florida Technical Assistance Advisement 13A-024 (Nov. 1, 2013). The requirement that the purchases be made with public funds does not specify how the funds are raised. Florida Technical Assistance Advisement 17A-016 (Aug. 17, 2017). “Defense Contractor”is a contractor who performs work for the federal government. Fla. Stat. §212.08(17); Florida Standard Industry Guide - Construction/Real Property Contractor (Jan. 2011). Defense contractors may be afforded federal tax immunity, thereby exempting them from Florida State taxation. Fla. Stat. §212.08(17); Florida Standard Industry Guide - Construction/Real Property Contractor (Jan. 2011). Public Works “Public works” are projects for public use or enjoyment, financed and owned by the government, in which private persons undertake the obligation to do a specific piece of work that involves installing tangible personal property that becomes a part of a public facility. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.094(1)(c).

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Mobile and Manufactured Homes

Taxable Sales of mobile homes, modular homes, prefabricated housing units or manufactured buildings prior to being affixed to realty are taxable as sales of tangible personal property. Fla. Stat. §212.02(19); Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.007(11). Contractors that manufacture and install factory-built buildings are subject to use tax only on the cost price of items that they use to manufacture the buildings. Fla. Stat. §212.06(1)(b). This differs from Florida's general rule on the use of self-produced items, which requires that use tax be calculated on their fabricated cost. Fla. Stat. §212.06(1)(b). “Factory-built building” is defined as a structure manufactured in a manufacturing facility for installation or erection as a finished building. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.043(3)(b). Modular home dealers cannot subtract manufacturer's labor costs from the cost price of the homes purchased. The taxpayer will owe sales tax on entire cost price of homes and not just on 60 percent of the cost of materials used by the manufacturer to construct the home. Florida Final Order DOR 2010-07-FOF (Nov. 8, 2010). Appurtenances sold with a mobile home bearing an “MH” decal are not subject to tax when separately described and priced on an invoice or bill, and the sale is made by a person not in the business of selling mobile homes. Exempt appurtenances include carports, sunrooms, utility sheds, furniture, freezers, refrigerators, drapes, or air conditioner components located outside the mobile home. If sales tax has been paid on these items, the purchaser may file for a refund. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.007(11)(h); Form DR-26SN, Instructions - Application for Refund Sales and Use Tax. The sale of land and a mobile home which is classified as real property as a packaged deal is not taxable. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.007(11). BNA-SUTN FL 28.8.
