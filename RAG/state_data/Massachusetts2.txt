Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, § 64H.1.7(3), effective Sept. 22, 2017. Additionally, beginning in 2018, out-of-state internet vendors must register, collect and remit Massachusetts sales and use tax if during the preceding calendar year, the vendor had more than $500,000 in Massachusetts sales and had 100 or more sales transactions that were delivered into Massachusetts.

Wayfair, Inc. overruling the physical presence standards of Quill Corp. v. North Dakota and Natl. Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev.. Specifically, the Supreme Court has determined that the lack of physical presence does not limit the imposition of sales and use tax remitting and collection obligations on out-of-state retailers. On June 22, 2018, the Massachusetts Department of Revenue issued a release stating that Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.1.7, which took effect in October, 2017 continues to apply and is not impacted by the Supreme Court's decision. South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., No. 17-494, 2018 BL 219995 (U.S. June 21, 2018); Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 298 (1992), overruled in part by South Dakota v.

The eight month period in question was from Oct. 1, 2017 through June 21, 2018, between the effective date of the regulation and the date the retailers began compliance following the decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., No. 17-494, 2018 BL 219995 (U.S. June 21, 2018). The Superior Court dismissed the claim citing that the retailers did not exhaust their administrative remedies. Blue Nile, LLC v. Harding, No. SUCV2018-3934-BLS1, 2019 BL 234230 (Mass. Super. Ct. May 13, 2019) (noting that the Appellate Tax Board has primary jurisdiction). Revocation of Vendor Registration Registration may be suspended or revoked for the following reasons:• willful failure to file a lawfully required return; • willful filing of a false return; • willful failure to collect or account for tax; • conviction of a tax crime; • willful failure to comply with any part of the Massachusetts tax code; or • cessation of activity for which the registration was issued.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Business Owners, Operators

Yes If a corporation, partnership, or limited liability company fails to pay to the Commissioner any required tax or required taxes of such taxpayer, the person or persons who have or had the duty to pay over the tax or taxes on behalf of the corporation, partnership, or limited liability company will be personally and individually liable for the amount of the required tax or required taxes. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.31A.1(3)(a). Exception for Certain Responsible Person Determinations Made on or After Dec. 8, 2005 No person will be personally or individually liable for a use tax liability due from a corporation, partnership, or limited liability company resulting from purchases by the corporation, partnership, or limited liability company of tangible personal property or services purchased for use by the entity unless the person's failure to pay the tax was willful or unless the person made personal use of the property or services subject to tax. This exception applies to responsible person determinations made on or after Dec. 8, 2005. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.31A.1(3)(a). Procedure The Commissioner will notify each person in writing of the proposed determination of personal liability. The person may confer with the Commissioner as to the original assessment or the proposed determination of personal liability. Upon the Commissioner's determination that the person was or is under a duty to pay over taxes, an assessment upon the responsible person occurs and the responsible person is personally and individually liable for the assessed and unpaid taxes of the corporation, partnership, or limited liability company. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.31A.1(3)(b). Information Used in the Determination of Who May Have the Duty to Pay Over Taxes The determination of who is under a duty to pay over taxes is made case by case, based on the facts and circumstances of the individual case. The Commissioner may use any information to determine who may be or may have been under a duty to pay over taxes, including but not limited to the following.• Examination of Records: The Commissioner may examine any records, including but not limited to the following: Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.31A.1(4)(a). o Tax Returns: To determine who may be or may have been under a duty to pay over taxes, the Commissioner may examine the taxpayer's Massachusetts returns and the taxpayer's Application for Registration, Form TA-1. The Commissioner may also examine federal tax returns for the same purpose. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.31A.1(4)(a)(1). o Other Records: To determine who may be or may have been under a duty to pay over taxes, the Commissioner may examine all or any of the following records, as well as any other relevant records. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.31A.1(4)(a)(2). › articles of incorporation, › minute books and bylaws, › bank records, › signature cards, › cancelled checks and bank statements, › partnership agreements, › operating agreements of limited liability companies. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.31A.1(4)(a)(2). • Investigation: To determine who may be or may have been under a duty to pay over taxes, the Commissioner may conduct an investigation or audit and may use any documents, testimony, or any other information derived from the investigation or audit. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.31A.1(4)(b). Factors in the Determination of Who May Have the Duty to Pay Over Taxes: The factors that the Commissioner may consider to determine who may be or may have been under a duty to pay over taxes include, but are not limited to, the following: Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.31A.1(5). • Duty to Pay Over Taxes Shared by More Than One Person o Multiple Determinations: The Commissioner may make multiple proposed determinations of personal liability if the Commissioner believes more than one person has or had the duty of collecting and paying over taxes on behalf of the same taxpayer. If the Commissioner determines that more than one person has or had the duty of collecting and paying over taxes on behalf of the same taxpayer for the same tax periods, such persons will be jointly and severally liable for the amount of the assessment. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.31A.1(5)(a)(1). o Partners in a Partnership: Ordinarily, all general partners of a partnership are under a duty to pay over taxes. The Commissioner may thus make proposed determinations of personal liability against any or all general partners. The Commissioner may make a proposed determination of personal liability against a limited partner if the limited partner is shown to be or to have been under a duty to pay over taxes. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.31A.1(5)(a)(2). o Members of an LLC: Ordinarily, all managing members of an LLC are under a duty to pay over taxes. The Commissioner may thus make proposed determinations of personal liability against any or all managing members. The Commissioner may make a proposed determination of personal liability against a non-managing member if the non-managing member is shown to be or to have been under a duty to pay over taxes. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.31A.1(5)(a)(3). • Duty to Pay Over Taxes Acquired After Original Assessment: o The Commissioner will not generally make a proposed determination of personal liability if the Commissioner believes the person did not have the duty to pay over taxes during the period of time in which the taxpayer's liability for the original assessment arose. But if funds sufficient to pay the unpaid original assessment are available to the taxpayer at the time a person acquires the duty to pay over taxes and the person fails to pay the original assessment upon receipt of a demand, the Commissioner may make a proposed determination of personal liability against that person. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.31A.1(5)(b). o The Commissioner will not make a proposed determination of personal liability against a person for an original assessment against a limited liability company that arose prior to Dec. 8, 2005, unless funds sufficient to pay the unpaid original assessment became available to the limited liability company on or after Dec. 8, 2005, and the person fails to pay the original assessment upon receipt of a demand. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.31A.1(5)(b). • Duty to Pay Over in Absence of Other Factors: In the absence of any other relevant factors, the Commissioner may consider that all or any one or more of the following persons are or were under a duty to pay over the taxes: Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.31A.1(5)(c). o the president, secretary, and treasurer of a corporation; Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.31A.1(5)(c)(1). o any other principal officer or officers, whatever their titles, of a corporation; Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.31A.1(5)(c)(2). o all or any one of the active partners of a partnership; Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.31A.1(5)(c)(3). o all or any one of the managers of a limited liability company; Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.31A.1(5)(c)(4). and o all or any one of the members of a limited liability company involved in managing the company. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.31A.1(5)(c)(5). Whether a person is personally liable for unpaid Massachusetts sales and use tax is a question of fact determined in reference to multiple factors including:• the relationship of the person to the taxpayer, • the exercise of control by the person over the taxpayer's affairs, • the exercise by the party of control over the disbursement of the taxpayer's funds, and • the capacity of the part to prevent the tax liability from accruing. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 62C, § 31A.; Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, § 62C.31A.1. See Massachusetts Directive 02-1 (Feb. 13, 2018). In Massachusetts Comr. of Rev. v. Brown, the taxpayer was a minority shareholder in a corporation that failed to remit to the Commissioner of Revenue Massachusetts sales tax. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court found that, while the taxpayer had the power to sign company checks, he never did, and he never partook in the preparation of the corporation's tax return. As the taxpayer's main function was to provide long-term financial planning and to raise capital, the Court found that he could not be held liable as a responsible party. Massachusetts Comr. of Rev. v. Brown, 424 Mass. 42 (Mass. 1997). In Berenson v. Massachusetts Comr. of Rev., the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that a corporate officer who was held liable as a responsible party for the payment of unremitted corporate sales tax was also personally liable for the accumulated penalties and interests on the unremitted sales tax. Berenson v. Massachusetts Comr. of Rev., 604 N.E.2d 704 (Mass. 1992). BNA-SUTN MA 31.3.3.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Due Date Filing

20th of the Month The general rule in Massachusetts is that sales and use tax returns must be filed on a monthly basis. However, the Commissioner of Revenue has the authority to permit taxpayers to file a return on a quarterly or annual basis. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 62C, §16(h), (i). Monthly Returns The Department of Revenue requires that any vendor having a sales tax liability of more than$1,200 for a calendar year must file a monthly return. The return must be submitted to the state no later than the 20th of the month following the month for which the return is being filed. For example, the January return is due no later than Feb. 20. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.16.2(4); see Massachusetts Dept. of Rev., 2019 DOR Tax Calendar. Quarterly Return Any vendor having an annual sales tax liability estimated to be between $100 and $1,200 may file a quarterly return. The return is due on the 20th of the month following the end of the quarter. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.16.2(4); see Massachusetts Dept. of Rev., 2019 DOR Tax Calendar. Annual Return Massachusetts law permits any vendor having an estimated sales tax liability for the calendar year of less than $100 to file one annual return.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Due Date Extensions Extensions for Disaster Relief

Yes The Massachusetts Department of Revenue grants automatic extensions to affected taxpayers to file returns and submit payments of tax as the result of any declaration by the President of a disaster area within the United States. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 62C, § 3; Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 08-19. Historically, however, when Massachusetts has allowed for extensions of time to file and pay certain taxes for disasters, such as Hurricane Sandy, it has not allowed such extensions for trustee taxes, including sales and use taxes. See Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 12-9 (Nov. 8, 2012). 2019 Due to July 23, 2019 tornadoes, the Massachusetts Department of Revenue will waive any penalties associated with late returns or payments due from July 23, 2019 to Nov. 1, 2019.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Payment Methods Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)

Required for All Taxpayers Under the Electronic Funds Transfer program (EFT program), taxpayers make tax payments to the Department of Revenue by the electronic transfer of funds. Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 15–9 (Oct. 1, 2015). A taxpayer that participates in the EFT program transfers funds by instructing its designated financial institution to credit the commonwealth's depository bank and to debit the taxpayer's bank account for the amount of tax payment. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.78.1(3)(a). All taxpayers with sales and use tax liabilities of $100,000 or more for the preceding taxable year are required to make all tax payments through the EFT program. Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 15–9 (Oct. 1, 2015). Any taxpayer with sales and use tax liabilities of $25,000 or more in the preceding taxable year may submit an application to participate in the Department of Revenue's EFT program on a voluntary basis. Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 15–9 (Oct. 1, 2015). A taxpayer's request to participate in the EFT program is subject to the Commissioner's approval, with the taxpayer's EFT computer capability an important factor in that determination. Once a taxpayer is registered as a voluntary participant, the taxpayer may not withdraw from the program without approval. Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 15–9 (Oct. 1, 2015). Waiver and Withdrawal From Participation A taxpayer may request a waiver from participation in the EFT program, as described below. The Commissioner may withdraw approval of any taxpayer's participation in the EFT program. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.78.1(3)(d). Mandatory Participants Any taxpayer that receives notice from the Department of Revenue that mandatory participation in the EFT program is required may request a waiver from participation by writing to the Department's EFT Unit. A waiver from participation will be granted to mandatory participants in the EFT program only if the Commissioner determines that the taxpayer's withholding or other tax liability does not, in fact, equal or exceed the mandatory EFT payment threshold. The taxpayer must continue participation in the EFT program until the Commissioner grants approval of the waiver. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.78.1(3)(d)(1). Registration Requirements A taxpayer must register for the EFT program, by submitting a completed, signed Application for Electronic Funds Transfer to the Department's EFT Unit. Required information for each tax account includes the taxpayer's name, address, contact person, telephone number, financial institution, federal identification number(FID), tax type, period end date, and payment amount. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.78.1(4)(a)(1). The Department's EFT Unit will review each application and, upon approval, will provide to each taxpayer, in addition to the Department's EFT Handbook, an individualized sample of the taxpayer's EFT tax payment record format and a designated date for each tax type to begin participation in the EFT program. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.78.1(4)(b). Department's Tax Payment Requirements Once a taxpayer is participating in the Department's EFT program, all withholding and other approved tax payments for that taxpayer's account(s) must be made through the EFT program. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.78.1(5)(b)(1). EFT Tax Payment Procedures Tax Payments Through Taxpayer's Financial Institution Before submitting an Application for Electronic Funds Transfer to the Department, to ensure that EFT payments will be credited to the proper account each taxpayer should confirm with its financial institution that:• the financial institution has the capability and is willing to remit payments through the ACH network; Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.78.1(5)(a)(1)(a). • the taxpayer and its financial institution have a formal agreement, required by National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) regulations; Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.78.1(5)(a)(1)(b). and • the financial institution uses the standard record format for tax payments adopted by NACHA. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.78.1(5)(a)(1)(c). Taxpayer's Information to Its Financial Institution Before making its first EFT payment to the Department, a taxpayer must provide to its financial institution all relevant information required in the Department's Application for Electronic Funds Transfer, including the Department's individualized sample tax payment record format. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.78.1(5)(a)(2). Prenotification Test Before making a first EFT payment to the Department, a taxpayer's financial institution should conduct a pre-notification test, which is a banking industry safeguard, to verify the commonwealth's routing/transit number and bank account number. A pre-notification test (or pre-note test) is a zero-dollar transaction processed at least 10 days before the taxpayer's first EFT payment. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.78.1(5)(a)(3).

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Use-Based Exemption Certificates

Required Massachusetts Form ST-12 certifies that tangible personal property is purchased for a use that is exempt under Mass. Gen. L. ch. 64H, §6(r) or (s). Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.8.1(2) (exempt use form). Acceptance of Exempt Use Certificates If a purchaser purchases tangible personal property for a purpose that qualifies for exemption from the sales and use tax, the purchaser may present an exempt use certificate to the vendor to certify that the tangible personal property will be used in an exempt manner. The burden of proving that a sale of tangible personal property is exempt is on the vendor unless the vendor accepts an exempt use certificate from the purchaser. A purchaser may not present, and a vendor may not accept, an exempt use certificate for a purchase of taxable services. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.8.1(5)(a). Good Faith Requirement for Exempt Use Certificates An exempt use certificate relieves the vendor from the burden of proof that a sale of tangible personal property is for exempt use only if the vendor accepts the certificate in good faith from a purchaser. At the time of purchase of the tangible personal property, the purchaser must intend to use the property in a manner that qualifies for an exemption from sales and use tax. Good faith is also satisfied if the purchaser, at the time of purchase, is unable to ascertain whether the tangible personal property will be used in an exempt manner or will be used for some other purpose. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.8.1(5)(b).

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Direct Pay Permits

Authorized Vendors are generally required to collect tax on the retail sale of all tangible personal property and taxable services and to remit that tax to the state. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 64H, §3(a); Mass. Gen. L. ch. 64I, §4. Under the direct payment program, the burden of proving that the vendor was not required to collect the tax is on the vendor unless the vendor takes a direct payment certificate (Form ST-14) from a qualified purchaser in good faith. Once a Form ST-14 is accepted in good faith by a vendor, the liability for the payment of the sales or use tax and for the filing of all related returns is placed on the qualified purchaser. The qualified purchaser will be required to file sales and use tax returns with and pay the appropriate tax directly to the Department of Revenue. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.3.1(3)(a). Procedure for Application Purchaser Qualifications Any purchaser meeting the following qualifications may apply for direct payment authority:• the purchaser must operate a business that regularly acquires tangible personal property or taxable services; Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.3.1(4)(a)(1). • the purchaser must reasonably expect and demonstrate that its purchases subject to Massachusetts sales/use tax will be of a sufficient dollar volume to allow the Commissioner to find that the purposes of the direct payment statute will be furthered by granting a direct payment permit to the applicant. The Commissioner anticipates that a dollar volume of $1 million of purchases subject to Massachusetts sales/use tax ($50,000 of tax liability) per year or greater will be sufficient to satisfy this criterion; Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.3.1(4)(a)(2). • the purchaser must register as a vendor, and must agree to file monthly sales/use tax returns and pay the Department of Revenue monthly on the purchases made; Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.3.1(4)(a)(3). • the purchaser must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that it maintains a viable automated accounting system that can track its taxable purchase transactions, produce written periodic reports, and accurately calculate the sales/use tax due; Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.3.1(4)(a)(4). • the purchaser must identify the names and business addresses of all business locations from which the direct payment certificate, if granted, will be used, or to which goods will be sold and/or delivered. A Form ST-14 will be limited to use by the single legal entity to whom and in whose name the certificate is issued; and Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.3.1(4)(a)(5). • the purchaser must provide all additional information that the Commissioner believes necessary to verify the adequacy of the purchaser's self-assessment, collection and remittance procedures, and any other information necessary to substantiate any aspect of the purchaser's application. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.3.1(4)(a)(6). Notification of Acceptance or Rejection The Commissioner reviews the vendors' application to determine if the selection criteria have been met. If the Commissioner determines that the selection criteria have been satisfied, he or she will grant direct payment authority to the purchaser. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.3.1(4)(b). Appeal Process A purchaser that has been denied direct payment authority may appeal the decision of denial in writing to the Appeal and Review Bureau. The decision of the Appeal and Review Bureau will be the final determination of any administrative appeal. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.3.1(4)(c). Bond Requirements The Commissioner may require a purchaser to post a bond in an amount, and from a surety, acceptable to the Commissioner as a condition of receiving a Direct Pay Permit or Form ST-14 if, in the discretion of the Commissioner, it is in the best interest of the state to require such security. The amount of the bond must be at least equal to the estimated yearly tax amount that will be due from the purchaser if direct payment authority is granted, but may be higher if the circumstances require. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.3.1(5). Use of Direct Payment Certificates(Form ST-14) Acceptance of Form ST-14 On each and every occasion when a qualified purchaser purchases tangible personal property or taxable services for use in the course of its business, the qualified purchaser must present its Form ST-14 to the vendor to certify that the qualified purchaser has direct payment authority. In lieu of presenting its Form ST-14 on each separate occasion when a qualified purchaser makes a purchase from a vendor, the qualified purchaser and vendor may agree that the delivery of the Form ST-14 will serve as applying on a “blanket”basis to all sales made by the vendor to the qualified purchaser and covered by the direct payment certificate. A vendor that is presented with a valid Form ST-14 and that accepts same in good faith will not collect the tax upon the purchaser's purchases and will not include the sales covered by the Form ST-14 in its gross receipts for the purposes of collecting and remitting tax, and will be relieved of the return and payment obligations with respect to these sales. For each transaction in which the qualified purchaser uses its Form ST-14, all return, payment, and other obligations of a vendor will rest with the qualified purchaser. A qualified purchaser will not transfer, assign, loan, or otherwise permit any other person or entity to use or possess its Form ST-14. A qualified purchaser will not use its Form ST-14 to purchase tangible personal property or taxable services on behalf of any other person or entity. Either practice by a qualified purchaser will be grounds for revocation and termination of its direct payment permit. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.3.1(6)(a). Good Faith Requirements for Form ST-14 The burden of demonstrating that the vendor was not obligated to collect a sales/use tax from a purchaser will rest with the vendor. Acceptance of a Form ST-14 will relieve the vendor from the requirement of collecting the tax only if the vendor accepts the form in good faith from a qualified purchaser that, at the time of purchasing the tangible personal property or taxable services, intends to use the property or services only for business purposes. A vendor may seek confirmation from the Commissioner prior to accepting a Form ST-14 as to whether the purchaser that tenders the certificate is a qualified purchaser. The vendor may make such inquiries of the qualified purchaser that the use of the Form ST-14 is proper as will reasonably satisfy the vendor that it is given in good faith. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.3.1(6)(b). Requirements for Proper Form ST-14 Each Form ST-14 must be in the form prescribed by the Commissioner and must contain the following information:• name of qualified purchaser; Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.3.1(6)(c)(1). • address of qualified purchaser; Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.3.1(6)(c)(2). • qualified purchaser's registration number and permit number; Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.3.1(6)(c)(3). • effective date of the Form ST-14; Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.3.1(6)(c)(4). • expiration date of the Form ST-14; Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.3.1(6)(c)(5). • certification that the tangible personal property and services are being purchased only for business purposes; and Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.3.1(6)(c)(6). • any other information the Commissioner may require. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.3.1(6)(c)(7). Conditions of Use The use of Form ST-14 does not affect the amount of tax due from any transaction. Form ST-14 may only be used for purchases for business purposes. Form ST-14 may not be presented for the purchase of motor vehicles, boats, airplanes, meals, alcoholic beverages, or any other goods or services specifically excluded. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.3.1(3)(b). Vendor Requirements Upon written notice to a vendor, the Commissioner may require the vendor to produce any and all Forms ST-14 accepted by the vendor during any period for which a tax return has been filed or for which a return is due. The vendor must make the requested Forms ST-14 available for inspection by the Commissioner within 60 days of the date of the Commissioner's request. If the vendor does not produce the requested Form ST-14 within the 60-day period, the vendor must carry the burden of proving, by other evidence, that the vendor was not required to collect the tax based on the qualified purchaser's direct payment authority. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.3.1(6)(d). Audit and Recordkeeping Requirements Qualified purchasers will maintain a list of all vendors to whom they have issued Form ST-14, including the date each was issued. Upon the request of the Commissioner a qualified purchaser will produce this list, the original Form ST-14, or any other information required to verify the qualified purchaser's compliance, or that the proper tax is being paid in a timely manner. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.3.1(8). Term and Renewal Direct payment authority granted to a particular qualified purchaser will be valid for a term of not greater than five years, and will expire on Dec. 31st of the final calendar year of the current term. Qualified purchasers must apply for renewal of direct payment authority no later than 120 days before the end of the current term. The Commissioner will review the purchaser's participation in the program as well as the selection criteria to determine whether a renewal should be granted. Notification of the decision of renewal or termination will be given to the qualified purchaser no later than 30 days before the end of the current term. The qualified purchaser must notify the Commissioner within 30 days of any changes that occur to the form of legal organization of the qualified purchaser that would require a new federal FID number or Department of Revenue registration number for that purchaser. In such event, the existing direct pay permit (Form ST-14) will be null and void and the new purchaser will re-apply for direct payment authority under the new organizational structure following the application process. If any organizational change occurs, whether by merger, acquisition, or otherwise, where the qualified purchaser entity no longer conducts an active trade or business or no longer has a legal existence, the direct payment authority will automatically terminate. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.3.1(9). Revocation, Termination, and Penalties Revocation and Termination Direct payment authority may be revoked by the Commissioner at any time upon 30 days written notice to the qualified purchaser, and may be revoked without notice if the Commissioner determines that the collection of any tax due from the qualified purchaser is in jeopardy. Any qualified purchaser whose direct payment authority is either forfeited voluntarily, revoked by the Commissioner, or has expired will return the original Form ST-14 to the Commissioner and immediately notify all vendors from whom it has purchased taxable items that its Form ST-14 is no longer valid. In addition, the Commissioner has the discretion to disallow the qualified purchaser from using its direct payment authority for transactions with a particular vendor if in his or her discretion it is warranted. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.3.1(10)(a). Penalties A qualified purchaser that fails to give such notice will be fined $1,000 per vendor to which notification was required to have been given. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.3.1(10)(b). BNA-SUTN MA 31.8.10.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Record-Keeping Requirements

3 Years Massachusetts law requires that any person required to file a sales and use tax return preserve and maintain the books and records that were used in completing and filing their returns. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.25.1(1). Likewise, the Commissioner of Revenue can require any taxpayer to keep specific records as the Commissioner deems necessary to properly assess and determine the taxpayer's appropriate tax liability. Where the taxpayer is required to maintain both machine-sensible and hard-copy formats, the taxpayer must provide the Commissioner with the machine-sensible copy. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.25.1(1). For the purposes of record-keeping, a hard-copy record is any document, records, reports, or other data printed on paper. Machine-sensible records are a collection of related information in an electronic format. Machine-sensible records do not include hard-copy records that are created or recorded on paper or stored in or by an imaging system such as microfilm, microfiche, or storage-only imaging systems. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.25.1(2). Form of Records Records that the taxpayer are required to keep in order for the Commissioner to assess and verify the accuracy of the taxpayer's tax liability must be kept organized, easily locatable, and in a form that allows the Commissioner to easily verify the taxpayer's tax liability. If the taxpayers records are not kept in a neat, organized fashion the Commissioner can require that the records be organized. If the taxpayer refuses to comply, the Commissioner may use whatever reasonable means necessary to determine the taxpayer's sales and use tax liability. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.25.1(3). Retention Period Unless otherwise authorized in writing by the Commissioner, a taxpayer must maintain records for no less than three years. For any period in which a vendor omits from a sales tax return an amount greater than 25 percent of the amount properly includible, the statute of limitations is six years, and the vendor must retain records for this duration. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.25.1(7); Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.6.7(b)(2). Required Records Every vendor engaged in business in the state is required to maintain the following records: • a journal or its equivalent, which records daily all non-cash transactions affecting accounts payable; • a cash journal or its equivalent, which records daily all cash receipts and cash disbursements, including any check transactions; • a sales slip, invoice, cash register tape, or other document evidencing the original transaction, which substantiates each entry in the journal or cash journal; • memorandum accounts, records, or lists concerning inventories, fixed assets, or prepaid items, except in cases where the accounting system clearly records such information; and • a ledger to which totals from the journal, cash journal, and other records have been periodically posted. The ledger must clearly classify the individual accounts receivable and payable and the capital account. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.25.1. Point of Sale (POS) Systems POS records are considered electronic records that may be requested by the department during an audit. Vendors using POS systems must ensure that their systems comply with the record-keeping requirements of Mass. Gen. L. ch. 62C, §25. Each POS transaction record must provide enough detail to independently determine the taxability of the sale and the amount of tax due and collected by the vendor. Massachusetts Directive 16-1. Electronic POS system records must also permit a direct reconciliation of receipts, invoices and other source documents with entries in the books and records of the taxpayer. If the electronic records cannot be reconciled with other records, the electronic records may be found inadequate and another audit method may be used to determine taxable sales and liability. Massachusetts Directive 16-1. BNA-SUTN MA 31.9.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Refunds

Vendor Purchasers seeking a refund of Massachusetts sales or use tax that was paid in error must request such refund from the vendor from whom they made the relevant purchase by presenting a resale or exempt use certificate, or other suitable documentation. Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 16-12. If any refund of any tax is made, the state treasurer will repay to the taxpayer the amount of such refund with interest at the rate of the federal short-term rate determined under I.R.C. §6621(b), as amended and in effect for the taxable year, plus two percentage points, computed as simple interest, from the date of overpayment to a date, to be determined by the commissioner, preceding the date of the refund check by not more than 30 days, whether or not such refund check is accepted by the taxpayer after tender of such to the taxpayer. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 62C, §40(a). The acceptance of such check will be without prejudice to any right of the taxpayer to claim any additional overpayment and interest thereon. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 62C, §40(a). The term “date of overpayment” will mean the later of the date when the commissioner will have received a properly completed return and full payment of the tax due, or the date when the commissioner will have received a completed and substantiated written application for abatement, and any supplemental information requested by the department from the taxpayer in support of such application. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 62C, §40(a); see Mass. Gen. L. ch. 62C, §37 and Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.37.1 for information on applying for an abatement. If an overpayment of tax is refunded within 90 days after the last day prescribed for filing the return of such tax, determined without regard to any extension of time for filing the return, or, in case the return is filed after such last date, is refunded within 90 days after the date the return is filed, no interest will be allowed on the overpayment. If any overpayment of tax is not refunded within 90 days after a return is filed where such return is filed after the last day prescribed for filing such return, determined without regard to any extension of time for filing such return, interest will be allowed on such overpayment only from the date the return is filed. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 62C, §40(b). The Massachusetts Appellate Tax Board has the jurisdiction to review a refusal of the Commissioner of Revenue to abate or refund a tax. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 62C, §39. Under Mass. Gen. L. ch. 62C, §37, the Commissioner is authorized to abate a tax that is “excessive in amount or illegal,” but may withhold a refund of tax until the taxpayer “establishes to the satisfaction of the commissioner”that the taxpayer has repaid the tax to its purchaser. In Massachusetts Administrative Decision C321816, the board ruled that it had the authority to, upon an appeal hearing, deem repayment of tax satisfied and order a refund accordingly. Massachusetts Administrative Decision C321816 (June 21, 2018). BNA-SUTN MA 31.10.

3 Years A claim for refund where the return is not timely filed must be made by filing the overdue return within three years from the due date of the return, taking into account an extension of time for filing the return, or within two years of the date the tax was paid, whichever is later. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 62C, §36. A claim for refund where no return is required to be filed must be made within two years from the date on which the tax was paid. A claim for refund where a return is timely filed must be made within the period permitted for abatement for that return. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 62C, §36. BNA-SUTN MA 31.11.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Statute of Limitations Assessment of Additional Tax

3 Years The Commissioner of Revenue may assess additional sales or use tax within three years from the date when the return is due, or the date on which the return was actually filed, whichever is later. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 62C, §26(b); Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.26.1. Upon a filing of false or fraudulent returns, the three-year statute of limitations may be extended to allow the Commissioner to assess additional taxes. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 62C, §26. The Commissioner must establish:• there exists a tax deficiency; • a failure to pay the tax; and • an intent to evade paying the tax due. Massachusetts Administrative Decision 255109 (May 11, 2001). BNA-SUTN MA 31.11.2.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Civil Penalties

Yes If a return is not filed with the Department of Revenue by the statutory due date, the Department will impose a penalty equal to 1 percent of the amount of tax owed for every month, or fraction, in which the tax goes unpaid. The penalty will not exceed 25 percent of the amount of tax to be paid. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 62C, §33. Granted extensions delay the statutory due date and no penalties will be imposed if the return is filed by the end of the extension. The same penalty applies for late payment of taxes. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 62C, §33. Interest on Penalties Interest will begin to accrue on the 31st day after the taxpayer receives the notice of assessment of a penalty from the Commissioner of Revenue. Once interest has started accruing, it will continue to accrue until the penalty, and all accrued interest, is paid in full. Massachusetts Directive 10-4. BNA-SUTN MA 31.12.1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Criminal Penalties

Yes A person commits a criminal offense if the person willfully fails to collect or truthfully account for and pay to the commissioner the tax collected by that person. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 62C, §73(b). BNA-SUTN MA 31.12.2.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Waiver of Penalties

Depends The Commissioner of Revenue may abate a late filing or late payment penalty, if it is shown that the failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 62C, §33. Additionally, the Commissioner of Revenue must waive or abate any portion of any penalty attributable to erroneous advice furnished to the taxpayer in writing by an officer or employee of the department of revenue, acting in such officer's or employee's official capacity. To qualify for this waiver, the advice must be reasonably relied upon by the taxpayer and be in response to a specific written request of the taxpayer. Additionally, to qualify for waiver the penalty must not have resulted from a failure by the taxpayer to provide adequate or accurate information. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 62C, §36. BNA-SUTN MA 31.12.3.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Interest Frequency of Interest Rate Determination

Quarterly Massachusetts determines underpayment and overpayment interest rates on a quarterly basis. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 62C, § 32(a) Interest accrued on underpayments of tax is compounded daily. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 62C, § 32(a). However, there is no compounding of interest due on overpayments of tax. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 62C, § 40(a). BNA-SUTN MA 31.13.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Interest Underpayment Rates Calculation

Federal short-term rate + 4% In Massachusetts, interest on underpayments accrues at the federal short-term rate plus 4 percent. The Massachusetts Department of Revenue issues quarterly Technical Information Releases to announce the interest rates on sales and use tax underpayments. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.33.1(3)(a). Interest generally accrues from the statutory due date of the return to and including the date the tax is paid in full. However, if the commissioner issues a notice of assessment, interest on the assessed tax is computed from the statutory due date of the return to and including the 30th day following the date of the notice, even if payment in full is made prior to the 30th day. If the full tax due is not paid by the 30th day following the notice, interest again accrues on a daily basis until it is paid in full. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.33.1(4)(b). The Commissioner may not abate assessed or accrued interest unless the underlying tax on which the interest is computed is also abated. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.33.1(4)(c).

Topic: Administration and Procedure Amnesty Programs 2016

Yes Massachusetts law authorizes the Commissioner of Revenue to establish a 60-day tax amnesty program for fiscal year 2016. 2015 Mass. H.B. 3650, §151(b), effective July 1, 2015; see Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 16-4 (Mar. 31, 2016); Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 15-12 (Oct. 28, 2015). The amnesty program ran from April 1 to May 31, 2016. Massachusetts Dept. of Rev., MA Tax Amnesty 2016. The amnesty program allowed the commissioner to waive penalties for eligible taxpayers. An eligible taxpayer is any individual or business taxpayer that:• failed to file a tax return that was due on or before December 31, 2015;or • has not reported the full amount of tax properly due on a previously filed return that was due on or before December 31, 2015. 2015 Mass. H.B. 3650, §151(a), effective July 1, 2015; Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 16-4 (Mar. 31, 2016). The following taxpayers are not eligible for the amnesty:• a taxpayer engaged in pending litigation with the Commissioner is not eligible to participate in the Amnesty Program with regard to a particular tax type and period if, as of April 1, 2016, the Appellate Tax Board or any court of law considering such litigation has ruled in the Commissioner's favor with regard to a disputed issue involving that tax type and period; Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 16-4 (Mar. 31, 2016). • a taxpayer who is seeking a waiver of tax penalties related to a pre-existing assessment, whether paid or unpaid; Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 16-4 (Mar. 31, 2016). • a taxpayer who has been or is the subject of a tax-related criminal investigation or prosecution as to any tax; Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 16-4 (Mar. 31, 2016). • a taxpayer who is seeking a refund of tax or a credit of an overpayment; Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 16-4 (Mar. 31, 2016). • a taxpayer who has been or is the subject of a tax-related criminal investigation or prosecution as to any tax; Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 16-4 (Mar. 31, 2016). • a taxpayer who delivers or discloses or who has delivered or disclosed a false or fraudulent application, document, return or other statement to the Department in connection with an Amnesty Return; Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 16-4 (Mar. 31, 2016). • a taxpayer who fails to report the full amount of tax properly due on an Amnesty Return or who attempts in any manner to defeat or evade a tax by using the Amnesty Program; Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 16-4 (Mar. 31, 2016). • a taxpayer who has entered into a settlement agreement with the Commissioner including, without limitation, settlement reached through the Department's Litigation Bureau, Office of Appeals, or Offer-in-Settlement Unit, is not eligible to participate in the Amnesty Program with regard to the particular tax type and period included in the settlement agreement Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 16-4 (Mar. 31, 2016). ; and • a taxpayer is not eligible to participate in the Amnesty Program with regard to the particular tax type and period for which the taxpayer was previously granted amnesty. Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 16-4 (Mar. 31, 2016). To qualify for the tax amnesty, the taxpayer must, before the amnesty period expires at 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday, May 31, 2016, voluntarily file proper returns and pay the full tax amount shown on the taxpayer's returns or upon the commissioner's assessments, plus all interest due. The tax amnesty program does not apply to a tax liability of any tax type for a period commencing on or after January 1, 2014. The commissioner determines the scope of the tax amnesty program, including the particular tax types, periods covered, and any look-back period for unfiled returns (not to exceed three years). 2015 Mass. H.B. 3650, §151(a), effective July 1, 2015; Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 16-4 (Mar. 31, 2016). If a taxpayer fails to pay his or her full tax liability by June 30, 2016, then there is no tax amnesty—the commissioner retains payments made and applies them against the taxpayer's outstanding tax liability. 2015 Mass. H.B. 3650, §151(b). The commissioner may not waive interest in any case. 2015 Mass. H.B. 3650, §151(c)(2), effective July 1, 2015. Nor may the commissioner waive penalties to a taxpayer who is or has been the subject of a tax-related criminal investigation or prosecution, or who delivers or discloses false or fraudulent documents. 2015 Mass. H.B. 3650, §151(c)(3), effective July 1, 2015; see Massachusetts Dept. of Rev., MA Tax Amnesty 2016. The Commissioner of Revenue will apply a limited three year look-back period to eligible non-filers who participate in the amnesty program. Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 16-4 (Mar. 31, 2016). The limited look-back period applies separately to each tax type reported on an Amnesty Return by a non-filer of that tax type. Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 16-4 (Mar. 31, 2016). This means that a taxpayer who has failed to file a return or pay any tax for any periods that were due before January 1, 2013, without regard to extensions, will not be required to file those returns or pay any tax due for those tax types and periods, and the Department will not initiate an audit to verify the tax due for these periods. Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 16-4 (Mar. 31, 2016). The limited look-back period will apply to taxpayers who file Amnesty Returns for all unfiled returns for a particular tax type that were due from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2015, without regard to extensions. The Amnesty Return must be accompanied by a payment of the full amount of tax and interest properly due. Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 16-4 (Mar. 31, 2016). Pursuant to the tax amnesty program, the commissioner maintains records of waived penalties, including:• the number of taxpayers provided with tax amnesty; • the types of tax liability for which tax amnesty was provided and, for each type of liability, the amount of tax liability collected and the amount of penalties foregone by virtue of the tax amnesty program;and • the total outstanding tax liability for amnesty-eligible taxpayers at the conclusion of the tax amnesty program after the collection of all funds under this section. 2015 Mass. H.B. 3650, §151(e), effective July 1, 2015. Lastly, the commissioner establishes administrative procedures and methods to prevent a taxpayer who receives tax amnesty from utilizing any future tax amnesty programs for the next consecutive 10 years, beginning in calendar year 2015. 2015 Mass. H.B. 3650, §151(f), effective July 1, 2015. BNA-SUTN MA 31.14.8.

Yes Massachusetts makes two voluntary disclosure options available to taxpayers. Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 11-1 (Jan. 31, 2011); Massachusetts Administrative Procedure AP 637;Massachusetts Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program. The first is a a voluntary disclosure program for taxpayers who have had no previous contact with the Department relating to the issues of the voluntary disclosure and are unregistered for the tax type for which the taxpayer wishes to disclose and the second is a voluntary disclosure program for the settlement of uncertain tax issues with a potential tax liability of $100,000 or more. Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 11-1 (Jan. 31, 2011); Massachusetts Administrative Procedure AP 637;Massachusetts Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program. Voluntary Disclosure Program — Non-Filing of Tax Returns The Massachusetts Department of Revenue has a voluntary disclosure program for taxpayers who wish to report previously unpaid sales and use tax liabilities. Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 11-1 (Jan. 31, 2011). To qualify for the program, the:• taxpayer must have had no previous contact with the Department of Revenue relating to voluntary disclosure; • taxpayer must not be registered for the tax type involved in the disclosure;and • tax cannot have been previously collected. Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 11-1 (Jan. 31, 2011). The voluntary disclosure program is an informal process, and it allows for taxpayers to come forward anonymously through a taxpayer representative. Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 11-1 (Jan. 31, 2011). Additional benefits available to the qualified taxpayer participating in the unregistered taxpayer voluntary disclosure program include a waiver of penalties and limited “look back”period of 3 years. Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 11-1 (Jan. 31, 2011). Voluntary Disclosure Program —Settlement of Uncertain Tax Issues In 2016, Massachusetts launched a voluntary disclosure program to encourage taxpayers to come forward and propose a settlement relating to “uncertain tax issues.” This program is available to business taxpayers with an uncertain tax issue associated with a tax return filed pursuant to §§ 11, 12, or 16 of Chapter 62C of the Massachusetts general laws and one which remains open under the statute of limitations. The types of business tax returns filed pursuant to one of the three qualifying sections include: 1) corporate excise, 2) financial institution excise, 3) sales and use, 4) meals, including a local option meals, 5) cigarette excise, 6) room occupancy excise, 7) fuel, including special fuels, 8) direct broadcast satellite service, and 9) alcoholic beverages tax returns. Massachusetts Administrative Procedure AP 637;Massachusetts Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program. The potential tax liability attributable to the uncertain tax issue, must be $100,000 or more, exclusive of interest and penalties. Additionally, the taxpayer must not currently be under audit or have been notified of an audit. Massachusetts Administrative Procedure AP 637;Massachusetts Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program. In order to be eligible for resolution, the issue at hand must involve an “uncertain tax issue.” In general, an uncertain tax issue is defined as one for which there is no clear statutory guidance or controlling case law, and which has not been address by the Department in a regulation, letter ruling or other public written statement. An uncertain tax issue may be a purely legal issue or an issue that is fact intensive and to which the established law is unclear. However, to qualify as an uncertain tax issue under the Program, the issue must not have been addressed as part of a taxpayer's prior audit, prior application for abatement or amended return, or prior ruling requested by the taxpayer. Massachusetts Administrative Procedure AP 637;Massachusetts Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program. To participate in the program, taxpayers must submit an anonymous letter to the department describing the uncertain tax issues and requesting to participate in the program. After review, the department will notify the taxpayer of acceptance into the program. Taxpayers have 45 days to indicate whether they choose to participate. Taxpayers electing to participate must disclose their identity at the time of acceptance. Taxpayers must also provide additional information to the department, as well as make a settlement proposal for the tax periods at issue, during the 45-day period. A conference with the department may also be held. Massachusetts Administrative Procedure AP 637;Massachusetts Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program. If the department and the taxpayer do not reach a settlement agreement, a letter will be issued to the taxpayer. If a later audit results in additional tax being assessed for the uncertain tax issues, interest and penalties relating to the uncertain issues will be waived. Massachusetts Administrative Procedure AP 637;Massachusetts Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program. Additionally, taxpayers and advisors should be aware that in the event a settlement is not agreed to by the taxpayer and the Department, the Department is not precluded from using information obtained during the voluntary disclosure process for the purposes of auditing the taxpayers return or returns or in defending any subsequent appeal of such audit. However, in the event that the taxpayer's returns are audited for the tax period or periods which included the unsettled tax issue, any penalties that would otherwise be due, including the 20% underpayment of tax penalty and the 100% failure to disclose an inconsistent position penalty, will be waived as long as the taxpayer acted in good faith in pursuing the transaction or transactions or other matters giving rise to the voluntary disclosure case and in presenting the facts and related analysis to the Department throughout the voluntary disclosure process. The taxpayer will also retain any and all administrative appeal options otherwise available. Massachusetts Administrative Procedure AP 637;Massachusetts Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Audits

Authorized The Commissioner of Revenue, or any individual whom the Commissioner appoints, is lawfully entitled to examine the records, books, papers, and other data held by a taxpayer for the reason of ensuring that the taxpayer has fully satisfied their tax liability. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 62C, §20, 24. Records that the taxpayer is required to keep in order for the Commissioner to assess and verify the accuracy of the taxpayer's tax liability must be kept organized, easily locatable, and in a form that allows the Commissioner to easily verify the taxpayer's tax liability. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §62C.25.1(3). The Commissioner of Revenue has three years from the date upon which the return was filed to audit the return. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 62C, §24. Where the taxpayer's records are so voluminous as to make the process of auditing them in their entirety administratively impossible, the Commissioner may use statistical sample methods to conduct the audit. The sampling method is to be agreed upon by both parties (the state and the taxpayer). If after a good faith effort to agree upon a sampling method the two parties cannot reach an agreement, the Commissioner is entitled to use any statistical sampling method that the Commissioner deems appropriate and that complies with the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 62C, §24. Participation of the Commissioner With Governmental Officers or Agencies to Determine Tax Liability The Commissioner of Revenue may participate jointly with the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States or the Secretary's appointed delegates to determine the appropriate tax liability of a taxpayer. The Commissioner may jointly examine, verify, assess, or audit any taxpayer in order to ensure that the taxpayer has satisfied its tax liability. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 62C, §23. BNA-SUTN MA 31.16.

Mass. Gen. L. ch. 62C, §39; Massachusetts Administrative Procedure AP 629.

A copy of the petition must be served on the commissioner by mailing or hand delivering such petition to the department's Litigation Bureau.
