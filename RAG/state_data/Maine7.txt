Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Other Food-Related Transactions

Depends If a prepared meal is provided with temporary lodging (e.g., a meal provided with bed and breakfast accommodations, or a continental breakfast offered by a hotel), then the entire charge for the meals and lodging is taxable at the rate applicable to the rental of living quarters, and the lodging provider does not owe use tax on the meals'ingredients. Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 27. However, if a lodging provider offers “complimentary” food and drink items to guests in a common area (e.g., coffee and cookies available in a hotel lobby), then these items are not considered to be included in the charge for lodging, and the lodging provider must therefore either pay tax on its purchase of these items, or accrue use tax. Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 27.
