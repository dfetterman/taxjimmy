Taxable Indiana imposes a gross receipts tax on retail sales of tangible personal property within the state. Likewise, the state imposes a use tax upon the storage, use, or consumption of tangible personal property within the state. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-2-1(a); Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-1-2(a); Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-4-1; Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-3-2(a). Tangible personal property is property that can be seen, weighed, measured, felt, or touched, including electricity, water, gas, steam, and prewritten computer software.

Depends Generally, the performance of a service is not regarded as a transaction constituting a sale at retail and is not subject to Indiana's sales tax. Ind. Admin. Code r. 2.2-4-2. However, sales of the following services are treated as taxable retail transactions:• softening and conditioning water; Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-4-3. • renting or furnishing rooms, lodgings, or other accommodations, such as booths, display spaces, banquet facilities, and cubicles or spaces used for adult relaxation, massage, modeling, dancing, or other entertainment to another person if: o those rooms, lodgings, or accommodations are rented or furnished for periods of less than 30 days; and o the rooms, lodgings, and accommodations are located in a hotel, motel, inn, tourist camp, tourist cabin, gymnasium, hall, coliseum, or other place, where rooms, lodgings, or accommodations are furnished for consideration; Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-4-4(a), as amended by 2019 Ind. H.B. 1001, effective July 1, 2019. • electrical energy, natural or artificial gas, water, steam, or steam heating service; Ind.

Code Ann. §6-2.5-4-11. and • prepaid calling service or prepaid wireless calling service. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-4-13. Additionally, if items of personal property and services are furnished together under a single order for which a total combined price is charged, the sale is characterized as a “unitary transaction,” and tax is imposed on the entire charge, irrespective of the fact that services which would not otherwise be taxable are included in the charge or selling price. Ind. Code Ann. § 6-2.5-1-1; Ind. Code Ann. § 2.2-1-1; see also Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20120294 (out-of-state pump repair company engaged in unitary transaction by charging customers one price for both services and tangible personal property, so it must collect sales tax on the price charged to customer); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20140504 (taxpayer required to collect sales tax from customers on single unitary sublet charge made up of parts charges attributable to taxpayer and labor charges attributable to taxpayer's subcontractors); Indiana Letter of Findings 10-0094 (an office supply retailer that sells maintenance agreements for business machines and equipment should have collected sales tax on the agreements); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20150610 (Sept. 28, 2016) (by providing invoices, contracts, and receipts, a taxpayer successfully demonstrated that certain purchases were for labor and services alone, and thus not subject to sales and use tax); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20170481 (March 28, 2018) (retailer was incorrectly only charging sales tax on tangible personal property in a unitary transaction).

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

Taxable When under a mixed transaction sale involving the transfer of tangible personal property and service elements for a combined charge the true object is deemed to be the property transferred, Indiana treats the sale as a taxable “retail unitary transaction”. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-1-1(a); Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-1-2(b). A mixed transaction sale involving the transfer of tangible personal property and service elements is treated as the sale of a nontaxable service if the following conditions are satisfied:• the serviceman is in an occupation that primarily furnishes and sells services rather than tangible personal property; • the tangible personal property purchased is used or consumed in the performance of the service; • the price charged for tangible personal property does not exceed 10 percent compared with the service charge; and • the serviceman pays gross retail tax or use tax when the tangible personal property is purchased. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-4-2(a); see also Cowden &Son Trucking Inc. v. Indiana Dept. of Rev., 575 N.E. 2d 718 (Ind. Tax Ct. 1991); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20140079 (Aug. 27, 2014) (unitary transaction occurred when the invoice stated that “advertising fees are made up of multiple costs” and did not itemize charges for advertising services and promotional materials produced); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20120031 (Oct. 31, 2012) (unitary transaction occurred when snow plowing and ice removal company failed to provide documentation proving charges associated with salt used during ice removal services did not exceed 10 percent of the total service charge).

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Bundled Transactions

Taxable Indiana treats bundled transactions as taxable retail transactions. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-4-15; see Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20160237 (Feb. 22, 2017) (total charge for elevator maintenance agreement subject to tax as a bundled transaction). Indiana defines the term “bundled transaction” as a taxable retail sale of two or more products(except real property and services to real property) that are distinct, identifiable, and sold for one non-itemized price. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-1-11.5(b). However, the term does not include a retail sale in which the sales price of a product varies, or is negotiable, based on other products that the purchaser selects for inclusion in the transaction. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-1-11.5(c). Further, it does not include: • a retail sale that is comprised of a service that is the true object of the transaction and tangible personal property that is essential to the use of the service and provided exclusively in connection with the service; Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-1-11.5(d)(1); see Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20170604 (Jan. 31, 2018) (transaction entirely taxable because the true object of a t-shirt design service was completed t-shirts, which are tangible personal property). • a retail sale that includes both taxable and nontaxable products in which the seller's purchase price or the sales price of the taxable products does not exceed 10 percent of the total purchase price or the total sales price of the bundled products (i.e., the de minimis exception); Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-1-11.5(d)(2); see Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20170604 (Jan. 31, 2018). or • a retail sale that includes both exempt and taxable tangible personal property, any of which is classified as one of seven enumerated categories, See Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-1-11.5(d)(3)(A) (identifying the seven categories as (i) food and food ingredients; (ii) drugs;(iii) durable medical equipment; (iv) mobility-enhancing equipment;(v) over-the-counter drugs; (vi) prosthetic devices; and (vii) medical supplies). for which the seller's purchase price or the sales price is 50 percent or less than the total purchase price or the total sales price of the bundled tangible personal property. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-1-11.5(d)(3). When relying on the de minimis exception, taxpayers must keep sufficient records to prove that price of the taxable products does not, in fact, exceed 10 percent of the total purchase price. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20170604 (Jan. 31, 2018) (request for refund based on the minimis exception denied in part due to lack of records). BNA-SUTN IN 9.3.2.
