Taxable Alcohol and beverages, excluding noncarbonated and nonflavored water, are subject to Florida sales and use tax. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.057(1). County surtaxes apply to the same base as the state sales and use tax. Fla. Stat. §212.054(2)(a); Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-15.012(1)(a). Therefore, alcohol and beverages, excluding noncarbonated and nonflavored water, are subject to the county surtaxes. Calculating Sales and Surtax Sales tax and surtax are calculated at the point-in-time when each alcoholic beverage sale is made. When sales transactions are between whole dollar amounts, the bracket system is used to calculate sales tax and surtax due when any part of each total sale is less than a whole dollar amount. The amount of sales tax and surtax must be separately shown on each guest bill, invoice, or other evidence of the sales transaction. Florida Tax Brochure GT-800046. Two methods are used for calculating sales tax. If the seller does not put the public on notice that sales tax is included in the total charge for alcoholic beverages, the seller must use “Method 1”. “Method 2”is used when the seller puts the public on notice by posting price lists or displaying signs prominently throughout the business, that the sales tax is included in the total charge for alcoholic beverages. Florida Tax Brochure GT-800046. Method 1: To calculate the sales tax and surtax due on sales of alcoholic beverages, multiply the total gross sales of alcoholic beverages in a reporting period by the tax rate for the county in which the business is located. Florida Tax Brochure GT-800046. Method 2: To calculate the sales tax and surtax due on sales of alcoholic beverages for a reporting period:• divide the total receipts of alcoholic beverages by the rate divisor for the county in which you are located to calculate gross sales; and • subtract gross sales from the total receipts to compute the amount of sales tax and surtax due.

Likewise, bakery products, excluding items sold as hot prepared food products, that are sold for consumption off the premises are exempt from tax. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.011(3)(c); Florida Technical Assistance Advisement 12A-021 (Sept. 13, 2012). Florida has a rebuttable presumption that the sale of bakery products by pastry shops, or like establishments that have eating facilities are taxable when the bakery products are sold in quantities of five or fewer items, or the bakery products sold, regardless of the quantity, are not packaged in a manner that is consistent with an intention by the customer to consume the products off the seller's premises.

Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Prepared Food Prepared Food Items Sold by Grocery Stores and Supermarkets

Depends The taxability of prepared food items sold by grocery stores and supermarkets depends on the specific situation. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.011(4). Food prepared, whether on or off the seller's premises, and sold for immediate consumption is subject to tax. However, this does not apply to food prepared off the seller's premises and sold in the original sealed container, or to the slicing of products into smaller portions. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.011(4)(b); Florida Technical Assistance Advisement 12A-021 (Sept. 13, 2012). Hot prepared food products, whether sold separately or in combination with other food items, when heated by the seller rather than by the customer, are subject to tax. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.011(4)(c)(1). Food products, including bakery products, are considered hot prepared food products when a heat source is used to maintain the food product in a heated state or is used to reheat the food product. Bakery products that are sold while still warm from the initial baking are not hot prepared food products. Their temperature is a result of the timing of the customer's purchase rather than an indication of preparation to be sold in a heated condition. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.011(4)(c)(2).

Depends Florida exempts certain sales of meals by educational institutions. Food and beverages sold or served in a student cafeteria in a school offering grades K-12 as part of a school lunch to students, teachers, school employees, or school guests are exempt from sales and use tax. Florida Tax Brochure GT-800035. Prepaid College Meal Plan Exemption Effective July 1, 2015, the legislature clarified the prepaid college meal plan exemption. To qualify for the exemption, the meal plan must meet each of the following requirements:• the meal plan must be prepaid; for these purposes, “prepaid”means either purchased in advance of use or purchased using financial aid once disbursed; • the meal plan must be purchased from the college or other institution of higher learning or from an authorized third-party vendor licensed with the college or institution to provide such meal plans; • the meal plan must be purchased by, or on behalf of, a student currently enrolled or preparing to enroll at the school. A student taking any number of credit hours will qualify; • the meal plan must be for a defined quantity of units, such as a number of meals per week, month, year, or term; a set monetary amount; or an unlimited number of meals for a defined number of days; • the balance of unused units must expire at the end of an academic term. The expiration can be at the end of any academic term, not just the academic term in which they are purchased. Units can rollover from term to term, provided they will eventually expire at the end of an academic term; • the units cannot be refunded to the student at expiration. Refunds due to withdrawal from school, changing from a school meal plan to a meal plan provided by a sorority or fraternity, or other changes in circumstance do not disqualify a meal plan from the exemption. Refunds at graduation are considered the refund of units at expiration, and would disqualify a meal plan from the exemption. Florida Tax Information Bulletin 15A01-13 (June 26, 2015). Flex Dollars and Hybrid Meal Plans Many colleges offer flex dollars as a meal plan option. These flex dollars are treated like other cash equivalents, which entitle a person to redeem them in the future to receive tangible personal property or services. Most gift cards are not taxable when purchased. Instead, the taxability of the transaction is determined when the gift card is used. Florida Tax Information Bulletin 15A01-13 (June 26, 2015). Some colleges have hybrid meal plans, which have both a defined quantity of meals, as described above, and also provide a set amount of flex dollars that can be used at designated dining establishments. These meal plans can be partially or completely eligible for the exemption, depending on the type of plan. For hybrid meal plans, the portion of the plan that provides a defined number of meals and otherwise meets the requirements of a prepaid meal plan as described above is exempt from tax, regardless of whether the “flex” dollars qualify. The “flex”dollars are cash equivalents and the taxability is generally not determined until use. If the “flex” dollars meet the requirements of a prepaid meal plan as described above, the entire meal plan can be exempt, including the use of “flex” dollars to purchase food or beverages. If the “flex” dollars do not meet the requirements of a prepaid meal plan as described above, then the taxability will depend on the taxable nature of the items purchased. Items normally exempt under other provisions (e.g., certain groceries or bottles of water) will continue to be exempt, while taxable items (e.g., soft drinks) will continue to be taxable when purchased using “flex”dollars.
