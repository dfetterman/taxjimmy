Stat. §7201(k)(11) through 72 Pa. Stat. §7201(k)(19) and 72 Pa. Stat. §7201(o)(9) through 72 Pa.

The collection of the sales and use tax on services is contingent upon their delivery and predominant use within the Commonwealth. As a general rule, services delivered within the Commonwealth are determined to be predominantly used within the Commonwealth, while services delivered to locations outside of the Commonwealth are deemed to be predominantly used outside the Commonwealth, and therefore, are not taxable. See, e.g., 72 Pa. Stat. §7204 (specifying situs for imposition of tax). BNA-SUTN PA 9.2.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

True Object Test Pennsylvania applies the true object test to determine the taxability of transactions involving both taxable and nontaxable items. Graham Packaging Co. v. Pennsylvania, 882 A.2d 1076 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2005). To determine whether a transaction should be treated as a taxable sale of tangible personal property, the essence of the transaction test focuses on whether the essence or true object of the sale is in fact the tangible personal property transferred or is instead intangible property or a service with tangible property serving only as the medium of transmission. If the facts of the situation dictate that the transaction's essence(or “true object”) is the intangible property or service, then the transaction is exempt. Graham Packaging Co. v. Pennsylvania, 882 A.2d 1076 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2005). In Downs Racing LP v. Pennsylvania, the court held that where a transaction's “true object”is a service not defined as tangible personal property, and the tangible personal property is only the medium by which to transmit the service, that tangible personal property remains taxable. Downs Racing LP v. Pennsylvania, No. 202 F.R. 2013, 2017 BL 365162 (Pa. Commw. Ct. Oct. 12, 2017). BNA-SUTN PA 9.3.1.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Bundled Transactions

Taxable Bundled transactions are presumed to be taxable in Pennsylvania. 72 Pa. Stat. §7201(k)(9). Typically, a bundled transaction is a retail sale involving two or more items sold for one non-itemized price. As a general rule, tangible personal property or services that are utilized both for purposes that constitute a sale at retail and for purposes excluded from the definition of a sale at retail are presumed to be taxable unless the user proves that the predominant purposes of such property or services do not constitute a sale at retail. 72 Pa. Stat. §7201(k)(9); 72 Pa. Stat. §7202(a); 72 Pa. Stat. §7202(b). BNA-SUTN PA 9.3.2.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Local Jurisdictions, Taxability Distinctions

Differs from State Local jurisdictions in Pennsylvania are authorized to adopt sales and use taxes that may differ from the state sales and use tax. See e.g., 53 Pa. Stat. §12720.503(a). Pennsylvania law authorizes the governing body of a city of the first class to levy, assess, and collect a city sales and use tax upon each separate sale at retail or use within that city of tangible personal property or taxable services. 53 Pa. Stat. §12720.503(a); 53 Pa. Stat. §12720.503(b); 53 Pa. Stat. §12720.508(a); Philadelphia Code §19-2701(1); Philadelphia Code §19-2701(2). First Class Cities A city of the first class is a city having a population of one million or more. 53 Pa. Stat. §101. To enact the local sales and use tax, the governing body must adopt an ordinance and deliver the ordinance to the Department of Revenue no later than 90 days prior to the date the ordinance goes into effect. 53 Pa. Stat. §12720.508(a); 53 Pa. Stat. §12720.508(b). The ordinance must include the rate of the tax. 53 Pa. Stat. §12720.508(a). Any sales and use tax imposed is in addition to any other tax imposed by the city on the same item. Philadelphia Code §19-2809(9)(a). If the city chooses to change the rate of its local sales and use tax, it must deliver a certified copy of the ordinance changing the rate to the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue at least 90 days before the ordinance becomes effective. 53 Pa. Stat. §12720.508(d). The city sales tax is to be collected by the seller and paid over to the Commonwealth; while the city use tax is to be remitted to the Commonwealth by the person who makes a taxable use of tangible personal property upon which the city sales tax has not already been paid. 53 Pa. Stat. §12720.503(a); 53 Pa. Stat. §12720.503(b); Philadelphia Code §19-2701(1); Philadelphia Code §19-2701(2). Second Class Counties (Allegheny County) Pennsylvania law authorizes second class counties to enact sales and use tax upon each separate sale at retail or use of tangible personal property or taxable services, within the county. 16 Pa. Stat. §6152-B(a); 16 Pa. Stat. §6152-B(b); see Allegheny County Code §475-12(A); Allegheny County Code §475-12(B). The second class counties are counties having a population of at least 800,000 and less than 1,500,000. 16 Pa. Stat. §210(2). To enact the local sales and use tax, the governing body must adopt an ordinance and deliver the ordinance to the Department of Revenue no later than 90 days prior to the date the ordinance goes into effect. 16 Pa. Stat. §6156-B(a); 16 Pa. Stat. §6156-B(b). The sales and use tax may be imposed by second class counties in addition to the sales and use tax imposed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. 16 Pa. Stat. §6151-B. The county sales tax is to be collected by the seller and paid over to the Commonwealth, and the county use tax is to be remitted to the Commonwealth by the person who makes a taxable use of tangible personal property upon which the county sales tax has not already been paid. 16 Pa. Stat. §6152-B(a); 16 Pa. Stat. §6152-B(b);Allegheny County Code §475-12(A); Allegheny County Code §475-12(B). Local Tax Enabling Act: Transaction Tax (Other Political Subdivisions) Pennsylvania law authorizes certain local jurisdictions to adopt ordinances or resolutions that provide for the imposition, assessment, and collection of a transaction tax, as well as other nontransactional taxes within the jurisdiction. 53 Pa. Stat. §6924.301.1(a) (additionally the jurisdiction is authorized to impose taxes upon all persons, transactions, occupations, privileges, subjects and personal property within the limits of such political subdivisions, and upon the transfer of real property, or of any interest in real property within the jurisdiction). The municipalities and school districts authorized to impose a tax on transactions under the Local Tax Enabling Act may impose the tax at a rate of 2 percent on the retail sale of tangible personal property. 53 Pa. Stat. §6924.311(4). If two jurisdictions' taxes were to overlap on the same transaction, the rate of the tax for both jurisdictions will be one-half of the rate normally imposed by the jurisdiction. 53 Pa. Stat. §6924.311 (conclusion). The local taxing authority may impose tax on the privilege of doing business in the jurisdiction if:• the business conducts transactions in the jurisdiction for 15 days or more during a calendar year; or • the business has a base of operations in the jurisdiction. 53 Pa. Stat. §6924.301.1(a.1), as added by 2014 Pa. H.B. 1513, effective Jan. 1, 2014. The Pennsylvania political subdivisions authorized to adopt such a transaction tax include cities of the second class, cities of the second class A, cities of the third class, boroughs, towns, townships of the first class, townships of the second class, school districts of the second class, school districts of the third class, and school districts of the fourth class. 53 Pa. Stat. §6924.301.1(a). BNA-SUTN PA 9.4.
