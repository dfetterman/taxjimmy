Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Use Tax

Yes The state of Washington imposes use tax on the use of any tangible personal property within the state. Wash. Rev. Code §82.12.020. With respect to tangible personal property, use tax is imposed upon the first act within the state by which the taxpayer takes or assumes dominion or control over the tangible personal property. Wash. Rev. Code §82.12.010(6). With respect to services, use tax is imposed upon the first act within the state by which the taxpayer takes or assumes dominion and control over the property upon which the service was performed. Wash. Rev. Code §82.12.010(6) (defining use as “the first act within the state by which the taxpayer takes or assumes dominion or control over the tangible personal property”). The code does not limit dominion and control to actual consumption; rather, dominion and control is extended to preparatory acts, such as installation, storage, withdrawal from storage, or distribution within the state. Wash. Rev. Code §82.12.010(6); see Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 11-0210 (retention, display, and servicing of antique automobiles by taxpayer not in the automobile retailing business was sufficient exercise of “dominion and control” for the imposition of use tax). There is a presumption that property acquired by Washington residents is for use within Washington. Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 18-0010 (Jan. 12, 2018) (Washington taxpayer rebutted the presumption by showing their boat was purchased and moored out-of-state). Washington's use tax does not apply:• if the sale or use has already been subjected to sales or use tax and the tax has been paid; • where tangible personal property is acquired by bailment and use tax has once been paid based on reasonable rental measured by the value of the article at time of first use multiplied by the applicable tax rate as of the time of first use; • where tangible personal property is acquired by bailment, if the property was acquired by a previous bailee from the same bailor for use in the same general activity and the original bailment was prior to June 9, 1961; or • to the use of digital goods or digital automated services, which were obtained through the use of a digital code, if the sale to or use by the present user has already been subjected to sales or use tax and the tax has been paid by the present user or by the present user's bailor or donor. Wash. Rev. Code §82.12.020(3)(b). See Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 14-0409 (Dec. 23, 2014) (affirming that use tax does not apply if retail sales tax has been paid and rejecting taxpayer's argument that use tax should not apply if sales tax applies to the transaction).
