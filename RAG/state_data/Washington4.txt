Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Motor Vehicles, Intrastate or Non-Commercial Use Purchase, Lease, or Rental Transactions

Taxable Motor vehicle sales, leases, and rentals are subject to Washington sales and use tax. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.020(3); Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.020(2); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0299 (Sept. 30, 2016) (a Washington LLC that purchased a car in Oregon was liable for Washington use tax on the vehicle because the vehicle was used in Washington and no sales tax was paid at the time of purchase). The sale of new motor vehicles is subject to an additional 0.3-percent tax, so the total rate for the sale of new motor vehicles is 6.8 percent. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.020(3). Motor vehicles and trailers to be used for the purpose of transporting people or property for hire in interstate or foreign commerce are exempt. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0263. Motor vehicle leases and rentals are also taxable. An additional 5.9-percent tax applies to motor vehicle rentals for periods not more than 30 consecutive days. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.020(2); Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.011; Wash. Rev. Code §46.04.465. A seller of motor vehicles is responsible for collecting sales tax even though sellers may be required to pay use tax upon registering the motor vehicles. Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 16-0380 (Dec. 6, 2016). “Motor Vehicle” Defined Washington sales and use tax laws do not define the term “motor vehicle.” Under the motor vehicle laws, “motor vehicle” is defined as every vehicle that is self-propelled and every vehicle that is propelled by electric power obtained from overhead trolley wires, but not operated upon rails. Wash. Rev. Code §46.04.320. Sales of Motor Vehicles to Nonresident Persons A sale of a vehicle to a nonresident where the vehicle is delivered into the state of Washington is exempt from sales tax if the:• vehicle, trailer, or camper will be taken from the point of delivery in Washington to a point outside of Washington under the authority of a one-transit permit used by the director of licensing; or • motor vehicle, trailer, or camper will be registered and licensed immediately under the laws of the state of the purchaser's residence, will not be used in Washington for more than three months, and will not be required to be registered and licensed under the laws of Washington. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0264(1); Wash. Rev. Code §82.12.0251(2); Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-177(3)(a); Washington Special Notice June 28, 2019. If the vehicle bears Washington state license plates, then the seller must remove the Washington plates before delivering the vehicle and retain evidence of that removal to avoid liability for collection and payment of the retail sales tax. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0264(1); Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-177(3)(a). In all other cases where the vehicle is delivered to a buyer in the state of Washington, the retail sales tax applies and must be collected at the time of sale. The fact that the buyer claims to be a nonresident or that the buyer intends and actually used the vehicle in some other state does not by itself entitle the buyer to the exemption. If the seller licenses or registers the vehicle in Washington on the buyer's behalf the retail sales tax applies. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-177(3). Sales of Motor Vehicles to Nonresident Corporations A vehicle sold to a nonresident corporation for use outside Washington is exempt from sales tax. The sale must meet the same requirements as those that apply to nonresident persons described above. Some documents (e.g., residential rental agreement, voter registration card, or mortgage documents for a personal residence) do not pertain to corporate purchases. The seller must show that the nonresident corporation is the purchaser (i.e., vehicle is paid for by corporate check and registered in the corporation's name). Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-177(3)(c). A distinction exists between the corporation and its employees or officers. But the exemption still applies, for example, when an officer or employee, purchasing on behalf of the corporation, is a Washington resident provided that all other requirements are met. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-177(3)(c). A corporation with places of business in one or more states other than Washington is a “nonresident.”A Washington corporation purchasing a vehicle for out-of-state use by a nonresident salesperson or out-of-state office qualifies for this exemption if the vehicle leaves the state with a valid one-transit permit or with foreign state license plates attached at the time of delivery, and nonresident affidavits are completed. If the vehicle is subsequently used in Washington, use tax is due on the value of the vehicle at the time of its first use in Washington. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-177(3)(c). Vehicle is any type of vehicle that may be lawfully licensed under Wash. Rev. Code §46.16.010 for operation on a public highway in Washington. However, the term does not include any machinery and implements for use in conducting a farming activity. The term includes a car, truck, camper, trailer, bus, motor home, and motorcycle equipped for road use. It does not include farm tractors, bicycles, mopeds, motorized scooters, snowmobiles, or vehicles that are manufactured exclusively for off-road use. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-177(2). Use of a Vehicle Purchased Out-of-State The use of a vehicle in Washington is usually subject to use tax. Wash. Rev. Code §82.12.010(6)(a); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 18-0124 (May 8, 2018) However, private motor vehicles and services rendered upon such property are exempt from use tax if used in-state by a Washington resident or a nonresident member of the armed forces that previously acquired and used the item or service in another state of which she was a resident for more than 90 days prior to entering Washington. Wash. Rev. Code §82.12.0251(3); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 18-0124 (May 8, 2018) (”resident” means a person who manifests an intent to live or be located in Washington for more than a temporary or transient basis); see Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 13-0175 (June 11, 2013) (member of the armed forces that purchased a motor vehicle more than 90 days prior to entering Washington did not qualify for exemption where he first took possession of the motor vehicle in Washington and, therefore, did not satisfy the requirement of having also used the motor vehicle more than 90 days prior to entering the state). Abandoned Vehicles Sold by Tow Truck Operators Effective July 28, 2019, through Jan. 1, 2030, Washington exempts from retail sales tax and retailing business and occupation tax abandoned vehicles sold by a registered tow truck operator to a successful bidder at public auction or, if there is no successful bidder, to a licensed vehicle wrecker, hulk hauler, or scrap processor. However, the use of such an abandoned vehicle by a consumer is not exempt from use tax. Wash. Rev. Code §82.04.040(1)(b), as amended by 2019 Wash. S.B. 5668, effective July 28, 2019.

Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.809(1), as amended by 2015 Wash. S.B. 5987, effective July 15, 2015. Specifically, the exemption applies to new passenger cars, light duty trucks, and medium duty passenger vehicles that are:• exclusively powered by a clean alternative fuel; or • plug-in hybrids that can travel at least 30 miles on battery power alone. Washington State Dept. of Licensing, Frequently Asked Questions: Alternative Fuel Vehicles and Plug-In Hybrids Tax Exemptions. Beginning with sales made or lease agreements signed on or after July 1, 2016, the sales and use tax exemption for clean alternative fuel vehicles is applicable only up to $32,000 of a vehicle's selling or purchase price, or of total lease payments made plus the selling or purchase price of the leased vehicle if the original lessee purchases the leased vehicle before the expiration of the exemption.

Trade-ins for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicles There are two methods that can be used to apply the trade-in value of a vehicle against the cost of a lease of an alternative fuel vehicle. The trade-in value may be applied against the value of the leased vehicle, which reduces the monthly payments for purposes of calculating the retail sales tax due on the payments. Washington Tax Topics - Hybrids. The second method that may be used to apply the trade-in value of a vehicle against the cost of a lease of an alternative fuel vehicle allows the trade-in value to be applied against the initial lease payments, with no retail sales tax due until the trade-in value is used up. Washington Tax Topics - Hybrids.

For purposes of this exemption, “clean alternative fuel” means natural gas, propane, hydrogen, or electricity. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.809(3). A motor vehicle with an additional motor or generator powered by fuel other than clean alternative fuel may qualify for the exemption so long as the additional motor or generator does not power the vehicle's drive train. Washington Tax Topics –Electric Vehicles.

Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Motor Vehicles, Intrastate or Non-Commercial Use Demonstrators

Depends Automobile dealers may elect to compute the use tax upon the use of demonstrators by sales staff on either a “one per one hundred vehicles sold”basis or on an “actual number of demonstrators used” basis. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-132(6). Under the “one per one hundred vehicles sold” reporting basis, the use of demonstrators is subject to use tax on the basis of one demonstrator for each one hundred new automobiles and pickup trucks, or fractional part of such number, of all makes or models sold at retail including lease transactions during a calendar year. The use tax on each such demonstrator is measured by 25 percent of the average selling price, including dealer preparation, transportation, and factory or dealer installed accessories, of all makes and models of new passenger cars and new pickup trucks sold during the preceding calendar year divided by the number of such units sold, except that the first such vehicle reported during any calendar year is subject to use tax measured by the full average retail selling price. The average retail selling price is computed by dividing the total retail sales of new passenger cars and trucks in the preceding year by the total units sold in the preceding year. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-132(6)(a). The use tax is paid as of the date of the first sale in any calendar year and subsequently upon the sale of the one hundred and first automobile or pickup truck. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-132(6)(a)(ii). Dealers electing to report use tax on demonstrators on the “actual demonstrator”reporting basis are required to report use tax on each vehicle assigned to demonstrator use. The value is computed in the same manner as under the one per one hundred basis. The first vehicle in the current year used for demonstrator use is taxable on the full average selling price of all new vehicles sold in the preceding year. Additional vehicles put to use as demonstrators during the year are taxable on 25 percent of the average selling price of new vehicles sold in the preceding year. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-132(6)(b).

Taxable Washington imposes a sales tax on watercraft if delivery is made within the state of Washington. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0266; Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-238(3). However, a retail sale exemption is available for the sale of watercraft to nonresidents of Washington, even when delivery is made within Washington. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0266; Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-238(3). There is also a retail sales tax exemption for sales of watercraft to residents of foreign countries for use outside Washington, even when delivery is made in Washington. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.02665. The exemption is limited to retail sales of watercraft requiring U.S. Coast Guard registration or registration by the state of principal use according to the Federal Boating Act of 1958. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-238(3)(a). To qualify as exempt, the:• watercraft must not be used within Washington for more than 45 days from delivery; Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-238(3)(a)(i)(A); see also Washington Tax Topics –Purchase and Use of Vessels by Nonresidents. • seller must examine acceptable proof that the buyer is a resident of another state or a foreign country; Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-238(3)(a)(i)(B); see also Washington Tax Topics –Purchase and Use of Vessels by Nonresidents. and • seller, at the time of the sale, must retain as a part of its records a completed exemption certificate to document the exempt nature of the sale. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-238(3)(a)(i)(C); see also Washington Tax Topics –Purchase and Use of Vessels by Nonresidents. Purchases of Vessels 30 Feet or Longer A retail sales tax exemption is available for sales of vessels 30 feet or longer to individuals who are nonresidents of Washington. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-238(3)(b); Washington Tax Topics –Purchase and Use of Vessels by Nonresidents. The following requirements must be met:• the individual must provide valid proof of non-residency at the time of purchase; Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-238(3)(b)(i)(A); see also Washington Tax Topics –Purchase and Use of Vessels by Nonresidents. • the vessel purchased must measure at least 30 feet in length; Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-238(3)(b)(i)(B); see also Washington Tax Topics –Purchase and Use of Vessels by Nonresidents. and • the individual must obtain a valid use permit from the vessel dealer authorized to sell use permits. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-238(3)(b)(i)(C); see also Washington Tax Topics –Purchase and Use of Vessels by Nonresidents. A nonresident individual may purchase a vessel in Washington without paying retail sales tax and remain in the state for 12 consecutive months, from the date of issuance, by obtaining a use permit. If the nonresident individual uses that vessel in Washington after the use permit expires, then the individual is liable for retail sales tax on the original sales price of the vessel. In addition, interest is due from the date of purchase. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-238(3)(b)(v)(A). Vessel dealers are personally liable for the sales tax if the dealer either does not collect the sales tax when making sales to individuals without valid identification, or fails to maintain records of the sale. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-238(3)(b)(v)(B). Use Tax Use tax applies to the use of a water vessel in the state, unless an exemption otherwise applies. Wash. Rev. Code §82.12.020; see Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 87-105 (April 13, 1987). The use tax applies to the value of the vessel used in the state, which generally is the purchase price of the property, unless the purchase price does not represent the property's true value, such as where property is first acquired and used outside the state before its use in Washington. See Wash. Rev. Code §82.12.010(7)(a); Wash. Rev. Code §82.12.020; Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-178(4)(b); Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-178(4)(c). There is a presumption that property acquired by Washington residents is for use within Washington. Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 18-0010 (Jan. 12, 2018) (Washington taxpayer rebutted the presumption by showing their boat was purchased and moored out-of-state). For example, where a taxpayer converted the use of a passenger ship from interstate ferry transportation to use primarily for sightseeing tours occurring exclusively within the state's waters, and there was no purchase price available, the use tax due was calculated based on an approximation of the fair market value of the vessel at the time it was first used exclusively in Washington. The Department of Revenue's use of a straight-line method of depreciation to determine the ship's value was found to be a reasonable measure of the vessel's fair market value at the time the property became subject to use tax. Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0345 (Dec. 15, 2015). Use of Watercraft by Nonresidents Use tax does not apply, for the first 60 days, for temporary use or enjoyment of watercraft brought into Washington by a nonresident while temporarily in Washington. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-238(4)(b). Washington presumes that if a nonresident entity (e.g., a corporate, LLC, trust, or partnership)owns watercraft and uses it in Washington for more than 60 days in a 12-month period, then that use is more than temporary. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-238(4)(b)(i). However, effective Sept. 1, 2015, nonresident individuals may extend their stay in Washington waters to a maximum of six months during a 12-month period by obtaining pre-approval from the Department of Revenue to purchase nonresident vessel permits. Nonresident entities (e.g., corporations or LLCs) also may qualify to purchase nonresident vessel permits with Department of Revenue pre-approval if: (1) the vessel length is 30 to 164 feet;(2) no Washington resident is a principal of the entity; and (3) the nonresident entity vessel owner verifies eligibility for the permit. Wash. Rev. Code §88.02.620, as amended by 2015 Wash. S.B. 6057, §802, effective Sept. 1, 2015; Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-238(4)(e); Washington Special Notice Aug. 26, 2015. Watercrafts owned by nonresidents and in the state exclusively for repair, alteration, or reconstruction are exempt from use tax if removed from the state within 60 days; however, this time period can be extended by filing an affidavit with the Department of Revenue verifying that the vessel is located on waters of Washington exclusively for repair, alteration, testing or reconstruction. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-238(4)(c); Washington Tax Topics –Purchase and Use of Vessels by Nonresidents. Use of Vessels 30 Feet or Longer by Nonresidents A use tax exemption is available to nonresident individuals who purchase vessels thirty feet or longer used in Washington if the vessel is:• purchased from a vessel dealer and a use permit is obtained in accordance with Washington regulations; or • purchased from someone other than a vessel dealer and the nonresident individual obtains a use permit with 14 days; or • acquired outside of Washington and the nonresident individual buys a use permit within 14 days of bringing the vessel into the state. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-238(4)(d). “Watercraft” Defined The term “watercraft” includes component parts that are installed in or on the watercraft prior to delivery to and acceptance by the buyer, but only when these parts are sold by the seller of the watercraft. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-238(3)(a)(ii). “Component part” means tangible personal property that is attached to and used as an integral part of the operation of the watercraft, even if the item is not required mechanically for the operation of the watercraft. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-238(3)(a)(ii). Vessel Brokers It is the standard practice of the boat industry for the selling broker, who is considered the buyer's agent, to collect and pay the sales tax to the state on the buyer's behalf. Washington Special Notice Jan. 1, 2017. Brokers do not have to collect the sales tax from buyers when:• the broker receives a commission on the sale; • the entire transaction is closed directly between the owner and the buyer; and • the sale is reported to the Washington Department of Revenue on the broker's Transaction Report. Washington Special Notice Jan. 1, 2017. Boat Trailers Washington imposes sales and use tax on sales of boat trailers. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-238(3)(a)(ii).
