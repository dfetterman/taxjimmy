Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Tangible Personal Property

Destination Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, Pennsylvania follows “destination-based sourcing” rules for the imposition of the state sales and use tax. 72 Pa. Stat. §7202(a); 72 Pa. Stat. §7202(b); 61 Pa. Code §32.5(a); 61 Pa. Code §32.5(b). Under destination-based sourcing, the point of delivery of taxable property or services or the location where possession of taxable property is transferred by a vendor to a purchaser, or to the purchaser's designee, is the tax situs that determines the application of state sales and use tax. 72 Pa. Stat. §7202(a); 72 Pa. Stat. §7202(b); 61 Pa. Code §32.5(a); 61 Pa. Code §32.5(b). Items delivered outside the Commonwealth are not subject to Pennsylvania sales and use tax. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1510952 (Dec. 12, 2016). But see Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1425928, 1515825 (Nov. 2, 2016) (where there are two different ship-to addresses, one located inside Pennsylvania and the other outside, absent any further information, all items will be subject to tax). More specifically, in transactions where taxable property or services are delivered to locations within Pennsylvania, the transactions are subject to tax. When delivery of taxable property or services is made within the Commonwealth to a nonresident purchaser, the fact that the purchaser is a nonresident does not by itself make the transaction exempt from tax. 61 Pa. Code §32.5(a); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1503271 (July 19, 2016); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1425686 (July 19, 2016); and Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1523640 (July 19, 2016) (items delivered to Pennsylvania are subject to tax despite subsequent delivery and use outside the state); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1413543 (July 19, 2016) (tangible personal property billed/shipped to an in-state location justifies the imposition of sales/use tax). When tangible personal property is sold, leased or serviced within Pennsylvania and the vendor, lessor, or serviceperson is obligated to deliver it to a point outside of the Commonwealth, state sales tax does not apply. Similarly, if the vendor, lessor, or serviceperson is obligated to deliver the tangible personal property to a carrier or to the mails for transportation to a point outside the Commonwealth, state sales tax does not apply. 61 Pa. Code §32.5(b); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1600399 (Aug. 26, 2016); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1502939 (Aug. 31, 2016) (taxpayer entitled to a refund of sales tax paid on purchased equipment, because equipment was shipped to a NJ/NY pipeline expansion project, where the items were used). But see Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1501050, 1501051 (Oct. 4, 2016) (taxpayer has the burden of establishing that items in question never entered Pennsylvania). However, where tangible personal property under a sale, lease or service is delivered within the Commonwealth to a buyer, lessee, or the agent of a buyer or lessee, other than an interstate carrier, Pennsylvania sales tax applies regardless of whether the buyer or lessee transports the property out of the Commonwealth after the transaction is complete. 61 Pa. Code §32.5(b); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1503271 (July 19, 2016); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1425686 (July 19, 2016); and Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1523640 (July 19, 2016) (items delivered to Pennsylvania are subject to tax despite subsequent delivery and use outside the state). The following exceptions apply and remove from taxability a transaction where property that is purchased and delivered within Pennsylvania is later transported outside the Commonwealth following the transaction:• property purchased or temporarily having a situs within the Commonwealth solely for the purpose of being processed, fabricated or manufactured into, attached to, or incorporated into personal property and then transported for exclusive use outside the Commonwealth is deemed to be a resale and therefore is not subject to tax; 61 Pa. Code §32.5(c)(3)(i). and • the retail sale or use of motor vehicles, trailers or semitrailers, or bodies attached to the chassis of those vehicles that are sold to a nonresident of Pennsylvania to be used out-of-state and that are registered in another state within 20 days of delivery to the vendee is not subject to tax. 61 Pa. Code §32.5(c)(3)(ii). BNA-SUTN PA 4.1.1.

Destination Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, Pennsylvania follows “destination-based sourcing” rules for the imposition of the state sales and use tax. 72 Pa. Stat. §7202(a); 72 Pa. Stat. §7202(b); 61 Pa. Code §32.5(a); 61 Pa. Code §32.5(b). Under destination-based sourcing, the point of delivery of taxable services or the location where possession of taxable property is transferred by a vendor to a purchaser, or to the purchaser's designee, is the tax situs that determines the application of state sales and use tax. 72 Pa. Stat. §7202(a); 72 Pa. Stat. §7202(b); 61 Pa. Code §32.5(a); 61 Pa. Code §32.5(b). More specifically, in transactions where taxable services are delivered to locations within Pennsylvania, the transactions are subject to tax. When delivery of taxable property or services is made within the Commonwealth to a nonresident purchaser, the fact that the purchaser is a nonresident does not by itself make the transaction exempt from tax. 61 Pa. Code §32.5(a). When tangible personal property is sold, leased or serviced within Pennsylvania and the vendor, lessor, or serviceperson is obligated to deliver it to a point outside of the Commonwealth, state sales tax does not apply. Similarly, if the vendor, lessor, or serviceperson is obligated to deliver the tangible personal property to a carrier or to the mails for transportation to a point outside the Commonwealth, state sales tax does not apply. 61 Pa. Code §32.5(b); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1513979 (July 13, 2016) (testing services purchased in Pennsylvania, but rendered in Canada, are not subject to Pennsylvania's sales and use tax). Telecommunications Services The retail sale of the telecommunication services that are included within the meaning of tangible personal property are subject to the Pennsylvania state sales tax. Pennsylvania includes within its definition of “tangible personal property”prepaid telecommunications as well as interstate telecommunications service originating or terminating and charged to a service address within Pennsylvania. Intrastate telecommunications service, or service that originates and terminates within the Commonwealth, is also considered to be “tangible personal property.” However, an exception exists for subscriber line charges and basic local telephone service for residential use, and charges for telephone calls paid for by inserting money into a telephone accepting direct deposits of money to operate. 72 Pa. Stat. §7201(m); see also 72 Pa. Stat. §7202(a) (generally imposing sales tax on all retail sales of tangible personal property). The service address of any intrastate telecommunications service is deemed to be within Pennsylvania or within one of its political subdivisions, regardless of how or where the service is billed or paid. With respect to the interstate or intrastate telecommunications services, except for prepaid telecommunications, any charge paid through a credit or payment mechanism that does not relate to a service address, such as a bank, travel, credit or debit card, is deemed attributable to the address of origination of the telecommunications service. 72 Pa. Stat. §7201(m); 61 Pa. Code §60.20(c). Mobile Telecommunication Services Mobile telecommunication services are specifically excluded from Pennsylvania's definition of telecommunication services because they are considered enumerated services subject to tax and not tangible personal property. Pennsylvania has adopted the provisions of the federal Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act. Under the terms of this Act, the situs of the sale or use of mobile telecommunications services that are provided to a customer by a home service provider will be the customer's place of primary use, regardless of where the mobile telecommunications services originate, terminate, or pass through. 72 Pa. Stat. §7202(g). Prepaid Mobile Telecommunications Services The sale or use of prepaid mobile telecommunications services that are evidenced by the transfer of tangible personal property are subject to the Pennsylvania sales and use tax. 72 Pa. Stat. §7202(e.1)(1). Additionally, the sale or use of prepaid mobile telecommunication service that is not evidenced by the transfer of tangible personal property are subject to the Pennsylvania sales and use tax and are deemed to occur at the purchaser's billing address or the location associated with the mobile telephone number or the point of sale, depending on which location is applicable to the situation. 72 Pa. Stat. §7202(e.1)(2). Computer Software Services Sales tax is due on the location of the end user of computer software, even when the cloud server is located in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1518118 (Dec. 12, 2016); see also Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1607822 (June 9, 2017) (statement by petitioner that a certain percentage of individuals accessing cloud-based software are located outside Pennsylvania was sufficient to prove transactions involved exempt out-of-state users); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision Nos. 1622150, 1705188 (March 6, 2018) (granting partial refund based on affidavit of company's vice president and a listing of user names and locations showing that a percentage of users were outside Pennsylvania). But see Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1622700, 1702316 (March 6, 2018) (partially denying refund because petitioner did not provide a breakdown of user locations).

Stat. §7202(b); 61 Pa. Code §32.5(a); 61 Pa. Code §32.5(b). Under, destination-based sourcing, the point of delivery of taxable property or services or the location where possession of taxable property is transferred by a vendor to a purchaser, or to the purchaser's designee, is the tax situs that determines the application of state sales and use tax. 72 Pa.

Leases executed outside of Pennsylvania must conform to the following:• a lease payment made in accordance with a lease agreement executed outside of Pennsylvania by a resident, is subject to tax if during the corresponding lease period the property is brought within the geographical boundaries of Pennsylvania; unless, the lessee is otherwise exempt; or 61 Pa. Code §47.17(c)(1)(i)(B)(I). • a lease payment made in accordance with a lease agreement executed outside of Pennsylvania by a nonresident lessee is subject to tax if during the corresponding lease period the vehicle is used within Pennsylvania more than 7 days; unless, the nonresident lessee is exempt as a tourist or vacationer or is otherwise exempt. 61 Pa.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Local Sourcing

Origin Pennsylvania applies an origin-based sourcing method for calculating local sales tax. The origin-based method generally considers a sale to take place at the location where the transaction is completed. 61 Pa. Code §60.16. Thus, in Pennsylvania, any applicable local sales tax is imposed at the point of sale. A sale of property or a service delivered to a location within Pennsylvania is deemed to occur at the retailer's place of business. 61 Pa. Code §60.16(a)(11); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1510690 (July 19, 2016) (taxpayer denied refund of Philadelphia County local tax paid for drill rig tractor repair services, because the transaction occurred at the vendor's place of business in Philadelphia; thus, taxpayer properly paid Philadelphia local tax). A sale of property or a service delivered by the retailer or its agent to an out-of-state destination is subject to neither the state of Pennsylvania tax nor the local sales tax. The local tax is in addition to the state tax if a sale is deemed to have occurred in a locality imposing local tax. There are no transactions that are only subject to local tax. 61 Pa. Code §60.16(a)(11). First Class Cities (Philadelphia) The local sales and use tax enacted by a first class city is imposed on the sale of tangible personal property and services that are subject to the Commonwealth's sales and use tax. 53 Pa. Stat. §12720.503(a); 53 Pa. Stat. §12720.503(b); 53 Pa. Stat. §12720.506(1); 61 Pa. Code §60.16(b)(2); see Philadelphia Code §19-2701(1); Philadelphia Code §19-2701(2). All provisions that apply to the Commonwealth's sales and use tax, except for situsing rules, apply to the local tax. 53 Pa. Stat. §12720.502. A retail sale, except a sale of road construction material, including recycled asphalt, recycled concrete, asphalt, concrete and road aggregates, is deemed made at the place of business of the retailer, unless the retailer delivers tangible personal property to a destination outside the Commonwealth. 53 Pa. Stat. §12720.504(a); 72 Pa. Stat. §7202-A; Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1502939 (Aug. 31, 2016) (taxpayer entitled to a refund of sales tax paid on purchased equipment, because equipment was shipped to a NJ/NY pipeline expansion project, where the items were used). If the retailer has more than one place of business in the Commonwealth that participates in the sale, then the sale will be sourced to the place of business where the initial order for the tangible personal property was taken, even if the order must be forwarded to another location for acceptance, approval of credit, shipment, or billing. All sales by an employee are deemed to occur at the employee's place of business. 53 Pa. Stat. §12720.504(a). The sale and use of road construction material, including recycled asphalt, recycled concrete, asphalt, concrete and road aggregates are sourced to the items' final destination. Final destination is determined by the delivery or shipping documents relating to such sales. 72 Pa. Stat. §7202-A; 53 Pa. Stat. §12720.504. The lease of a motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer or mobile home, motorboat, aircraft, or other similar tangible personal property that is required under either federal or state law to be registered or licensed is deemed to occur at the address of the lessee, and a rental is deemed to occur at the location of the retailer. 72 Pa. Stat. §7201-A(a); 72 Pa. Stat. §7201-A(b); 72 Pa. Stat. §7201-A(c). For purposes of this rule, a “rental”involves the transfer of the possession of tangible personal property for a period of less than 30 days, while “leases” involve transfers for terms of 30 days or more. 72 Pa. Stat. §7201-A(c); 72 Pa. Stat. §7201-A(d). The sale and use of steam, natural and manufactured gas, or electricity are sourced to the service address where the meter that registers the service is located without regard to where the services are rendered. Similarly, landline telephone, and telegraph services are deemed to occur at the location where the telephone equipment to which the number is assigned is located, without regard as to where the services are rendered. 53 Pa. Stat. §12720.504(c). The situs of the sale or use of mobile telecommunications services provided by a customer home service provider, as defined in Section 117(a) and (b) of the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act (4 U.S.C. §116), is the customer's place of primary use regardless of where the mobile telecommunications services originate, terminate or pass through. 72 Pa. Stat. §7203-A(a). Second Class Counties (Allegheny County) The local sales and use tax enacted by a second class county is imposed on the sale or use of tangible personal property and services that are subject to the Commonwealth's sales and use tax. 16 Pa. Stat. §6152-B(a); 16 Pa. Stat. §6152-B(b); see Allegheny County Code §475-14(A). Furthermore, all provisions that apply to the Commonwealth's sales and use tax, except for situsing rules, apply to the local tax. 16 Pa. Stat. §6151-B;Allegheny County Code §475-14(A). The situs rules for the Second Class County Sales and Use Tax are the same as those for the First Class City Sales and Use Tax. 16 Pa. Stat. §6153-B. BNA-SUTN PA 4.1.4.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Credit for Tax Paid to Another Jurisdiction

Depends Pennsylvania offers a credit against the tax imposed upon tangible personal property or services purchased for use outside Pennsylvania in the amount equal to the tax paid to another state by reason of the imposition by the other state of a tax similar to the tax imposed in Pennsylvania. 61 Pa. Code §31.15. However, no credit is granted unless the other state grants substantially similar tax relief to the taxpayer. 72 Pa. Stat. §7206(a); 61 Pa. Code §31.2; see Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1600731 (May 16, 2017) (taxpayer not granted credit for tax paid in West Virginia, Oregon, or Maryland because those states do not offer a reciprocal sales tax credit). A contractor that purchased property for use outside of Pennsylvania is entitled to a credit for use taxes paid to another jurisdiction regardless of whether the property is initially delivered to the contractor in Pennsylvania.

Depends Tangible personal property purchased outside of Pennsylvania by a nonresident and brought into Pennsylvania in connection with the establishment of a permanent business or residence, may be exempt from Pennsylvania's sales and use tax if the property was purchased more than six months prior to the date it was brought into Pennsylvania or the date of establishment of the business or residence, whichever is earlier. 61 Pa. Code §31.3(20). For an aircraft, if a nonresident brings an aircraft or aircraft part into Pennsylvania following an out-of-state purchase, lease, or rental, then the nonresident is required to pay use tax unless an exemption applies. 72 Pa. Stat. §7201(a); 61 Pa. Code §31.2; 61 Pa. Code §58.8(c)(3); see also the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Pennsylvania 29. BNA-SUTN PA 4.3.1.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Temporary Presence, In-Transit Property Tangible Personal Property Temporarily Stored In-state

Taxable Effective March 4, 1971, property purchased outside of Pennsylvania for use outside Pennsylvania but temporarily stored in Pennsylvania, and upon which no work or services are performed, is a taxable use based upon the original purchase price of the property. 61 Pa. Code §32.5(f). While such interim storage subjects property to use tax, the storage charges are exempt from tax. 61 Pa. Code §32.5(f); see Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision Nos. 1617019, 1703766, 1703767 (Dec. 15, 2017); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1611706 (June 26, 2017).

Stat. §7201(a); 61 Pa. Code §31.2; 61 Pa. Code §58.8(c)(3); see also the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Pennsylvania 29. For motor vehicles, the use of a vehicle within Pennsylvania for a period of more than seven days, for any purpose other than leasing, makes the vehicle subject to use tax if the taxpayer is not a tourist or vacationer. 61 Pa. Code §47.17(c)(1)(ii)(B). For more information about sales tax on motor vehicles, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Pennsylvania 29.3. BNA-SUTN PA 4.3.2.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Temporary Presence, In-Transit Property Tangible Personal Property Purchased for Use Out-of-state

Exempt When tangible personal property is sold, leased, or serviced within Pennsylvania and the vendor, lessor, or service person is obligated to deliver it to a point outside of Pennsylvania or to deliver it to a carrier or to the mails for transportation to a point outside of Pennsylvania, sales tax does not apply. 61 Pa. Code §32.5(b). In a transaction where tangible personal property is purchased and delivered in Pennsylvania, but is later transported outside of Pennsylvania, the property involved will be exempt from Pennsylvania's sales and use tax laws if the property was purchased for the sole purpose of being processed, fabricated, or manufactured into, attached to, or incorporated into personal property and transported for exclusive use outside of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania deems such a transaction a resale and the property is therefore not subject to tax. 61 Pa. Code §32.5(c)(3)(i); 61 Pa. Code §31.3(8); see Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1610134 (May 9, 2017); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1421816 (Oct. 4, 2016). However, if the tangible personal property delivered in Pennsylvania, but later transported outside of Pennsylvania, is not purchased for the limited purposes of fabrication, manufacturing, or attachment to personal property, then the item is subject to Pennsylvania's sales and use tax. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1503271 (July 19, 2016); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1425686 (July 19, 2016); see Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision Nos. 1609354, 1613393 (May 9, 2017) (items first shipped to Pennsylvania taxable in Pennsylvania); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1515913 (March 6, 2017) (property shipped first to Pennsylvania but used in Maryland subject to tax); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1523640 (July 19, 2016) (items delivered to Pennsylvania are subject to tax despite subsequent delivery and use outside the state). The burden of proof is on the taxpayer to establish that the property in question was purchased by and subsequently transferred to an out-of-state purchaser. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1511982 (Aug. 31, 2016). Additionally, the retail sale or use of motor vehicles, trailers or semitrailers, or bodies attached to the chassis of those vehicles that are sold to a nonresident of Pennsylvania to be used outside of Pennsylvania and that are registered in another state within 20 days of delivery to the vendee is not subject to tax. 72 Pa. Stat. §7204(24); 61 Pa. Code §32.5(c)(3)(ii); see also Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1615642 (March 6, 2017) (a Pennsylvania resident's purchase of a motor vehicle in the Commonwealth that was subsequently shipped to another country denied refund).
