Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

True Object Test New Jersey applies the “true object test” in determining whether the provision of personal property in connection with the provision of services constitutes a retail sale of such personal property subject to taxation. See, e.g., Adamar of N.J. v. New Jersey Div. of Taxn., 17 N.J. Tax 80 (N.J. Tax Ct. 1997), aff'd, 18 N.J. Tax 70 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1999). In Adamar, the Tax Court of New Jersey held that the true object of renting a hotel room is not the acquisition of personal property such as shampoo, shoeshine cloths, and ballpoint pens provided as a part of the rental, but the use of the room itself. For this reason, the court held that the provision of such property to hotel guests was not a retail sale subject to sales tax to which a portion of the room rental price could be allocated. However, because hotel room rentals are themselves subject to New Jersey sales tax, this holding did not avoid sales tax on any portion of the room rental price. Moreover, because the provision of personal property to hotel guests as part of the room rental did not constitute a retail sale under the court's true object test analysis, the court held that the initial purchase of this property by the hotels did not qualify for the sale for resale exemption to sales and use tax. Consequently, the initial purchase of this property by the hotels would be subject to sales or use tax. Adamar of N.J. v. New Jersey Div. of Taxn., 17 N.J. Tax 80 (N.J. Tax Ct. 1997), aff'd, 18 N.J. Tax 70 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1999). The New Jersey Legislature seems to have codified the true object test in the context of professional, personal, and insurance services. New Jersey excludes from the definition of taxable retail sales the provision of professional, personal, or insurance services involving the transfer of personal property for which no separate charge is made where the transfer of personal property is an “inconsequential element” of the transaction. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-2(e)(4)(A). BNA-SUTN NJ 9.3.1.

Bundled Transactions That Include Telecommunications Services Where a bundled transaction sale includes a telecommunications service, ancillary service, internet access, or audio or video programming service and the price is attributable to both taxable and tax-exempt property or services, the entire price is subject to tax unless the service provider can adequately identify from its books and records that portion of the price attributable to tax-exempt property or services. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-2(oo)(4). Bundled Transactions That Include Internet Access Where a bundled transaction sale includes internet access service and the sales price is attributable to the internet access service and taxable property or services, the entire sales price is subject to tax unless the service provider can adequately identify from its books and records that portion of the price attributable to tax-exempt internet access service.
