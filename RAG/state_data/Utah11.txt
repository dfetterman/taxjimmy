Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Sales Tax

Yes Utah imposes sales tax on retail sales of tangible personal property and specified services. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-103. In Utah, sales tax is imposed on the purchaser for amounts paid or charged for transactions within the state involving: retail sales and leases of tangible personal property; certain services (e.g., telecommunications, utilities, repairs and renovations, admission fees, dry cleaning)and products transferred electronically. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-103, as amended by 2017 Utah S.B. 119, §2, effective retroactively to Jan. 1, 2017; Utah Admin. Code §R865-19S-2(A). The sales tax is a transaction tax, thus, the tax is on the transaction, not on the actual goods or services. Although the incidence of tax is on the purchaser, generally it is a vendor's responsibility to collect and remit the tax to the tax commission. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-103(2); Utah Admin. Code §R865-19S-2(B); Utah Publication No. 25. BNA-SUTN UT 1.1.1.

Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Use Tax

Yes A state use tax is imposed on any amount paid or charged for tangible personal property that is stored, used, or consumed within the state of Utah, or for the rental or lease of tangible personal property stored, used, or otherwise consumed within the state. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-103(1)(k); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-103(1)(l). Use tax also applies to purchases of certain services and to products transferred electronically. See Utah Admin. Code §R865-19S-2(A); Utah Publication No. 25. Utah treats the sales and use taxes as complementary in nature. Thus, if the sales tax is levied on a transaction, the use tax will not be imposed even if tangible personal property is stored, used, or consumed within the state. Utah Admin. Code §R865-19S-1(B); Utah Admin. Code §R865-21U-1(B); Utah Publication No. 25 (either sales or use tax applies to a transaction, not both). Examples of circumstances in which use tax is due when sales tax has not been collected include:• using items from resale inventories; • buying goods or services tax-free for personal or business use (e.g., advertising supplies, office or shop equipment, computer hardware and software, office supplies); and • buying products from unlicensed, out-of-state sellers. Utah Publication No. 25. BNA-SUTN UT 1.1.2.

See Utah Sales and Use Tax Rates, for a complete and current list of municipalities and towns that impose a resort community tax. Provisions of these local sales and use tax components must include provisions substantially the same as those included in the state sales and use tax code, permitting the substitution of the state name with that of the local county, city, or town as the taxing authority. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-204(3); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-204(6)(c); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-703(4)(a)(i)(A)(I); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-703(4)(a)(i)(A)(II); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-1402(4)(a)(i)(A)(I); Utah Code Ann. §59-12-1402(4)(a)(i)(A)(II). Note that a locality's authority to impose tax has restrictions. In certain circumstances, the localities are restricted from imposing certain tax components because another location has already imposed a tax on the sale or use. For example, counties, cities, and towns that enacted the one percent local sales and use tax are prohibited from taxing the sale, storage, use, or other consumption of tangible personal property that occurred in other counties, cities, or towns within the state if sales or use tax was previously charged or paid on such tangible personal property.

Similarly, counties that have enacted a rural medical facilities or a botanical, cultural, recreational, and zoological tax are prohibited from taxing the sale or use of tangible personal property or the enumerated services that occurred within the cities or towns of its jurisdiction that also impose this tax.

Telecommunications providers may either pay the MTLT themselves or collect the tax from their customers. If the tax is passed on to customers, the amount of the MTLT is part of the service sales price for sales tax purposes. Utah Publication No. 62. The MTLT return, which can be filed electronically, is due to the tax commission at the same time as the provider's sales and use tax return. Utah Publication No. 62. The tax commission provides a list of jurisdictions that impose the MTLT and the corresponding rates. Utah Publication No. 62;Utah Tax Comm., Utah Sales and Use Tax Rates. Municipal Energy Sales and Use Tax A municipality may levy a municipal energy sales or use tax of up to 6 percent of the delivered value of taxable energy(gas and electricity) sold or used within its borders. Utah Code Ann. §10-1-203; Utah Publication No. 54. This is in addition to any local-option sales and use taxes the municipality imposes. Utah Code Ann. §10-1-203; Utah Publication No. 54. If the sale of energy is taxable, an energy supplier that bills a consumer for costs to transport the energy to the consumer is also subject to the tax. Utah Publication No. 54.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Historical Information

Est. 1933 Utah introduced the sales tax in 1933 as a source of revenue in the wake of declining property tax collections during the Great Depression. Passed as a temporary emergency measure in 1933, the sales tax was made permanent later the same year. Utah State Tax Comn., History of the Utah Tax Structure (Dec. 2015). The state added the complementary use tax in 1937. Sales taxes were originally earmarked for Utah's “Emergency Relief Fund.” After 1955, the revenue was deposited in the General Fund. In the 1990s, earmarking sales tax reemerged for water, transportation, natural resources, and the Winter Olympic Games (hosted by Utah in 2002). The initial state sales tax rate was three-quarters of 1 percent effective on March 21, 1933. The general state tax rate as of Jan. 1, 2017, is 4.7 percent.

Tax Increases In 2017, Utah's legislature amended the state's Election Code relating to ballot initiatives proposing a tax increase. 2017 Utah H.B. 255, effective May 22, 2017. The amendments require that ballot initiatives and petitions for initiatives proposing a tax increase explain the potential impact of the proposed tax increase by clearly showing the “tax percentage difference” and the “tax percentage increase.” “Tax percentage difference”is the difference between the tax rate being proposed and the current tax rate. “Tax percentage increase” means a number calculated by dividing the tax percentage difference by the current tax rate and rounding the result to the nearest thousandth. Utah Code Ann. §20A-7-101, et seq., as amended by 2017 Utah H.B. 255, effective May 22, 2017. 2016 As the 2016 calendar year opened, one matter under watch in Utah was the state's disagreement brewing with the Streamlined Sales Tax Business Advisory Council (BAC) over the sales and use taxation of prewritten computer software. Letter to Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board (Sept. 22, 2015). The BAC appeared to have taken the position that Utah is out of compliance with the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement (SSUTA) by imposing tax on access to prewritten software. The state asserts that the SSUTA does not preclude Utah from taxing “mere access” to prewritten software, as its definition of sale is broadly stated. Additionally, Utah points to its statutory language in Utah Code Ann. §59-12-103(1)(m) permitting the imposition of tax whether the sale provides a permanent or less than permanent right to use the product, and to its language in Utah Code Ann. §59-12-211(12)(a) recognizing the taxability of computer software when “there is not a transfer of a copy of that software to the purchaser.” Letter to Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board (Sept. 22, 2015). The Utah State Tax Commission submitted its annual Compliance Recertification letter on July 20, 2016, certifying that the state is in substantial compliance with the terms of SSUTA. The Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board has not determined that Utah is not in compliance with SSUTA. See Utah's 2016 SSUTA Compliance Recertification (July 20, 2016). BNA-SUTN UT 1.3.
