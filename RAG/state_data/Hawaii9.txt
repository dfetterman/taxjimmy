Taxable Hawaii's general excise tax base is comprised of gross income or gross proceeds of sales, which means the gross receipts of a taxpayer received as compensation for personal services, the gross receipts of a taxpayer from trade, business, commerce, or sales, and the value from the sale of tangible personal property, service, or both. Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-3(a). BNA-SUTN HI 9.1.

Taxable The Hawaii general excise and complementary use taxes are imposed on the sale of goods and all other business activities, unless specifically exempted, including activities of a service business. Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-13(6); Haw. Rev. Stat. §238-2; see also Hawaii Letter Ruling No. 2012-13 (Sept. 19, 2012). A “service business”is defined to include all activities engaged in for other persons for a fee involving the rendering of a service as distinguished from the sale of property. A service business does not include the services rendered by an employee to the employer. Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-7. Before 2009, Hawaii used a “primary objective test” to distinguish the sale of a service from the sale of tangible property. A transaction was a sale of a service if tangible property was merely incidental to, and an inseparable part of the transaction. On the other hand, a transaction was a sale of tangible property if the services were merely incidental to, and an inseparable part of the transaction. The Hawaii Information Release setting forth the “primary object test” was superseded in 2009. Hawaii now taxes most services in addition to most tangible personal property and does not distinguish whether they are bundled or stated separately. See Hawaii Tax Information Release No. 98-9, superseded by Hawaii Tax Information Release No. 09-02. BNA-SUTN HI 9.2.

Gravamen of the Transaction The general excise tax is generally imposed on all gross income or gross proceeds from sales, including both the sale of tangible personal property and the sale of services. Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-3. Therefore, for purposes of determining the taxability of a mixed transaction, it is usually not necessary to determine whether the transaction should be characterized as the sale of tangible personal property or of a service, since either sale would be taxable. However, the character of a transaction as either a sale of tangible personal property or a sale of a service may determine its taxability when the sale is made to the U.S. Government or any of its instrumentalities. Sales of tangible personal property to the U.S. Government or its instrumentalities are exempt from general excise tax. Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-25(a)(3). On the other hand, sales of services to the U.S. Government or its instrumentalities, other than services performed under a “scientific work” contract, remain subject to tax. Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-13(6); Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-25(c); Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-26. For this reason, when tangible personal property is conveyed to a federal governmental entity in a mixed transaction including the provision of a service, the taxability of the transaction will often turn on whether it constitutes the sale of a service or of tangible personal property. If the transaction is the sale of a service, the service provider is generally subject to general excise tax on the entire amount that it charges for the service. If the transaction is the sale of tangible personal property, it is exempt from general excise tax. Hawaii Letter Ruling No. 2010-02 (Feb. 10, 2010). The Hawaii Department of Taxation has applied the “Gravamen of the Transaction Test” to determine whether a mixed transaction is the sale of a service or the sale of tangible personal property. Under this test, the transaction will be treated as the sale of tangible personal property if the service component is incidental to and inseparable from the sale of tangible personal property. If the service component is separable from or not incidental to the sale of tangible personal property, it will be treated as a separate taxable transaction for the sale of services. This will be the case, for instance, if a seller builds into the price of tangible personal property the value of included services that would otherwise be sold separately. Hawaii Letter Ruling No. 2010-02 (Feb. 10, 2010). BNA-SUTN HI 9.3.1.

Conforms to State Similar to the state tax, the county surcharge is a gross receipts tax assessed directly on the gross proceeds of sales or gross income of businesses, but may be passed on to the consumer. The county surcharge only applies to gross income or gross proceeds taxable by the state at the 4 percent rate. Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-13(9). The following persons or activities are subject to the 4 percent general excise tax rate: Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-13(9). • every person engaging in the business of operating a theater, opera house, moving picture show, vaudeville, amusement park, dance hall, skating rink, radio broadcasting station, or any other place at which amusements are offered to the public; Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-13(4). • contractors; Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-13(3). • real estate brokers and salespersons; Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-13(6); Haw. Rev.

Stat. §237-13(2); Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-1. and • every person engaging or continuing within the state in any business, trade, activity, occupation, or calling not explicitly stated in the applicable tax statute. Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-13(9). The county surcharge does not apply to gross income or gross proceeds taxable by the state at the 0.5 percent tax rate or the 0.15 percent tax rate. Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-8.6(d). Additionally, the county surcharge does not apply to any transactions, amounts, persons, gross income or gross proceeds exempt from the general excise or use tax. Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-8.6(e); Hawaii Announcement No. 2005-11. City and County of Honolulu The City and County of Honolulu is a consolidated city-county. (Island of Oahu) Although all counties have been given the power to impose the county surcharge, the City and County of Honolulu is the only county that has opted to impose the tax. The City and County of Honolulu encompasses the entire Island of Oahu. The county surcharge increases the state general excise tax for transactions on the island of Oahu by 0.5 percent, and is used to pay for Oahu's mass transit system. Haw. Rev. Stat. §46-16.8(f), as amended by 2015 Haw. H.B. 134, effective July 1, 2015; Honolulu, Haw. Rev. Ordinances, ch. 6, art. 60, §6-60.1. The county surcharge is imposed on gross income and gross proceeds for sales of tangible personal property shipped or delivered to the Oahu district if the taxpayer has substantial nexus with the Oahu district. Haw. Regs. §18-237-8.6-02. Substantial nexus is created by, but not limited to physical presence, such as the presence of an employee, representative, or property in the Oahu district. Haw. Regs. §18-237-8.6-02. “Oahu district” means the taxation district for the city and county of Honolulu. Haw. Regs. §18-237-8.6-01. Additionally, the county surcharge is imposed on:• gross income and gross proceeds for services intended to be used or consumed in the Oahu district provided that the taxpayer has substantial nexus with the Oahu district; Haw. Regs. §18-237-8.6-03. • gross income or gross proceeds from commissions when the services are rendered by the taxpayer in the Oahu district; Haw. Regs. §18-237-8.6-04. • gross income or gross proceeds from commissions earned from real estate sales, or leasing, or from financing transactions secured by real estate where the real property is located in the Oahu district; Haw. Regs. §18-237-8.6-04. • gross income and gross proceeds for renting or leasing personal property to the extent the property is used in the Oahu district; Haw. Regs. §18-237-8.6-05(a). • gross income from the rental or lease of real property located in Oahu district; Haw. Regs. §18-237-8.6-06. • gross income from contracting where the job site is located in the Oahu district; Haw. Regs. §18-237-8.6-07. • gross income from events, such as the gross income from the business of operating a theater, opera house, moving picture show, vaudeville, amusement park, dance hall, skating rink, or any other place at which amusements are offered to the public in the Oahu district; Haw. Regs. §18-237-8.6-09. and • any other gross income gross proceeds received by a taxpayer and sourced to the Oahu district. Haw. Regs. §18-237-8.6-10. Planning Point: On June 21, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., overturning the physical presence requirement for sales tax nexus. Physical presence is not required for there to be substantial nexus with the taxing jurisdiction under the Constitution's Commerce Clause. South Dakota v. Wayfair, 138 S. Ct. 2080, 2018 BL 219995 (U.S. 2018). Gross income from a taxpayer's investment interest is subject to the county surcharge if the control of the investment is located in the Oahu district. Haw. Regs. §18-237-8.6-08(a). A taxpayer may allocate gross income by using any reasonable allocation method that clearly, fairly, and properly reflects the gross income to the taxation district, if the method is documented. Haw. Regs. §18-237-8.6-08(a). A taxpayer's deferred payment interest is allocated to the Oahu district and subject to the county surcharge if the sale that generated the interest is allocated to the Oahu district. Haw. Regs. §18-237-8.6-06. In the event that a taxpayer rents or leases tangible personal property, or licenses or receives royalties from intangible personal property that is used in more than one taxation district, the gross income is allocated to the taxation districts by using any reasonable allocation method that clearly, fairly, and properly reflects the gross income to each district. Haw. Regs. §18-237-8.6-05(b). The allocation method must be supported by documentation. Haw. Regs. §18-237-8.6-05(b). Property that is constantly in transit between taxation districts, such as barges, containers, and aircraft without home ports or bases must be allocated to the taxation districts by using a reasonable method. Haw. Regs. §18-237-8.6-05(b). BNA-SUTN HI 9.4.
