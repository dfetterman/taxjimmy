Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Tangible Personal Property

Destination Kansas follows destination-based sourcing for general retail sales. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3669(a); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3670(a). For transactions occurring on and after April 1, 2004, retail sales, excluding leases or rentals, are sourced according to destination as follows: • When the product is received by the purchaser at a business location of the seller, the sale is sourced to that business location; • When the product is not received by the purchaser at a business location of the seller, the sale is sourced to the location where receipt by the purchaser, or donee of the purchaser, occurs, including the location indicated by instructions for delivery to the purchaser or donee, known to the seller; • If the above two rules do not apply, the sale is sourced to the location indicated by an address for the purchaser that is available from the business records of the seller that are maintained in the ordinary course of the seller's business, when use of this address does not constitute bad faith; • If the above three rules do not apply, the sale is sourced to the location indicated by an address for the purchaser obtained during the consummation of the sale, including the address of a purchaser's payment instrument, if no other address is available, when use of this address does not constitute bad faith; and • If no other rules apply, including the circumstance in which the seller is without sufficient information to apply the previous rules, then the location will be determined by the address from which tangible personal property was shipped, from which the digital good or the computer software delivered electronically was first available for transmission by the seller, or from which the service was provided, disregarding for these purposes any location that merely provided the digital transfer of the product sold. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3669(a); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3670(a). The terms “receive”and “receipt” describe the following: (1) taking possession of tangible personal property; (2) making first use of services; or(3) taking possession or making first use of digital goods, whichever comes first. Possession by a shipping company on behalf of a purchaser does not constitute receipt. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3670(e). The general sourcing rules for retail sales do not apply to sales or use taxes levied on leases and rentals; the retail sale or transfer of watercraft, modular homes, manufactured homes, or mobile homes; the retail sales of motor vehicles, trailers, semi-trailers, or aircraft that are not regarded as transportation equipment; transportation equipment; sales of advertising and promotional direct mail and other direct mail; or to telecommunications services or ancillary services. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3669(b); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3670; Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3672. Motor Vehicles, Trailers, Semi-Trailers, and Aircraft The retail sale, excluding the lease or rental, of motor vehicles, trailers, semi-trailers, or aircraft that do not qualify as transportation equipment, are considered to be consummated at the place of business of the retailer and sourced to this location. The isolated or occasional sale of any motor vehicle or trailer is considered consummated at the taxing jurisdiction where the sale is made. If the sale negotiations occurred in different cities or counties, the sale is sourced, for local sales tax purposes, to the place where the motor vehicle or trailer was kept at the time negotiations were first entered into. In the event the place of business of a retailer is doubtful the place or places at which the retail sales are consummated for the purposes of the tax law are determined under rules and regulations adopted by the secretary of revenue, which rules and regulations shall be considered with state and federal law insofar as applicable. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3669(b)(2); Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-191; Kansas Information Guide KS-1526. Leases and rentals of motor vehicles, trailers, semi-trailers, and aircraft that are not regarded as transportation equipment are sourced as follows: • for a lease or rental that requires recurring periodic payments, each periodic payment is sourced to the primary property location. The primary property location is as indicated by an address for the property provided by the lessee that is available to the lessor from its records maintained in the ordinary course of business, when use of this address does not constitute bad faith. This location is not changed by intermittent use at different locations; and • for a lease or rental that does not require recurring periodic payments, the payment is sourced the same as a retail sale. These rules do not affect the imposition or computation of sales or use tax on leases or rentals based on a lump sum or accelerated basis or on the acquisition of property for lease. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3669(a); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3670(c). See Kansas Information Guide KS-1526. Transportation Equipment All retail sales of transportation equipment, including leases or rentals, are sourced according to the general rules for the sourcing of retail sales. Any of the following property is regarded as transportation equipment:• locomotives and railcars that are utilized for the carriage of persons or property in interstate commerce; • trucks and truck-tractors with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 10,001 pounds or greater, trailers, semi-trailers or passenger buses that are registered through the international registration plan and operated under authority of a carrier authorized and certificated by the U.S. Department of Transportation or another federal or a foreign authority to engage in the carriage of persons or property in interstate or foreign commerce; • aircraft that are operated by air carriers authorized and certificated by the U.S. Department of Transportation or another federal or a foreign authority to engage in the carriage of persons or property in interstate or foreign commerce; and • containers designed for use on and component parts attached or secured on other transportation equipment. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3669(a); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3670(d). Watercraft and Modular, Manufactured, and Mobile Homes The retail sale or transfer of watercraft, modular homes, manufactured homes, or mobile homes is considered to be consummated at the place of business of the retailer and sourced to that location. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3669(b)(1); Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-191. Direct Mail Advertising and Promotional Direct Mail Direct mail is printed material delivered or distributed by U.S. mail or other delivery services to a mass audience or to addressees on a mailing list provided by the purchaser or at the direction of the purchaser when the cost of the items is not billed directly to the recipients. To qualify as advertising and promotional direct mail, the primary purpose must be to attract public attention to a product, person, business, or organization, or to attempt to sell, popularize, or secure financial support for a product, person, business, or organization. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3602(j); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3703; Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3672(c)(1). If a purchaser of advertising and promotional direct mail provides a seller with a direct pay permit, an exemption certificate, or information showing the jurisdictions to which the advertising and promotional direct mail is to be delivered to recipients, or other approved statement that relieves the seller of tax liability, the purchaser must source the sale to the jurisdictions to which the advertising and promotional direct mail is to be delivered to the recipients. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3672(a)(2). If a purchaser of advertising and promotional direct mail does not provide a direct pay permit, exemption certificate, or other statement, but provides the seller with information showing the jurisdictions to which the advertising and promotional direct mail is to be delivered to recipients, the seller must source the sale to the jurisdictions to which the advertising and promotional direct mail is to be delivered. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3672(a)(3). If a purchaser does not provide any of the above information to the seller, the sale is sourced to the address from which the advertising and promotional direct mail is shipped. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3672(a)(4); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3670(a)(5). Other Direct Mail Other direct mail is any printed material delivered or distributed by U.S. mail or other delivery services to a mass audience or to addressees on a mailing list provided by the purchaser or at the direction of the purchaser, when the cost of the items is not billed directly to the recipients, that does not qualify as advertising and promotional direct mail. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3672(c)(2). Generally, sales of other direct mail are sourced to the location indicated by the address for the purchaser that is available from the business records of the seller that are maintained in the ordinary course of the seller's business, when use of this address does not constitute bad faith. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3672(b)(1); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3670(a)(3). However, if the purchaser provides a direct pay permit, an exemption certificate, or any other statement relieving the seller's tax obligation, the sale is sourced to the jurisdictions to which the other direct mail is to be delivered to the recipients. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3672(b)(3). BNA-SUTN KS 4.1.1.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Services

Destination For transactions occurring on or after April 1, 2004, retail sales of taxable services are sourced to where the purchaser makes first use of such services. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3669(a); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3670(a); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3670(e)(2). With the exception of mobile communication services other than air-to-ground radiotelephone service, post-paid calling service, prepaid calling service, and prepaid wireless calling service, telecommunications sold on a call-by call basis are sourced to each level of taxing jurisdiction where the call originates and terminates in the jurisdiction, or each level of taxing jurisdiction where the call either originates or terminates and in which the service address is also located. In a case where these services are sold on a basis other than a call-by-call basis, the sale is sourced to the customer's place of primary use. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3673(a); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3673(b); see also Kansas Information Guide EDU-65. The following exceptions are made to this general rule: • sales of mobile communications services other than air-to-ground radiotelephone service and prepaid calling service are sourced to the customer's place of primary use; • sales of post-paid calling services are sourced to the origination point of the telecommunications signal as first identified by either the seller's telecommunications system, or information received by the seller from its service provider, where the system used to transport the signals is not the seller's;and • sales of prepaid calling services or prepaid wireless calling services are sourced under the general rule for retail sales. However, in the case of prepaid wireless calling services, if none of the general rules for sourcing of retail sales applies, the location associated with the mobile telephone number is an option as a location to source the sale. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3673(c); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3670(a). Private Communication Services: A sale of private communication services is sourced as follows: • service for a separate charge related to a customer channel termination point is sourced to each level of jurisdiction in which such customer channel termination point is located; • service where all customer termination points are located entirely within one jurisdiction or levels of jurisdiction is sourced in such jurisdiction in which the customer channel termination points are located; • service for segments of a channel between two customer channel termination points located in different jurisdictions and which segments of channel are separately charged is sourced 50 percent in each level of jurisdiction in which the customer channel termination points are located; and • service for segments of a channel located in more than one jurisdiction or levels of jurisdiction and which segments are not separately billed is sourced in each jurisdiction based on the percentage determined by dividing the number of customer channel termination points in such jurisdiction by the total number of customer channel termination points. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3673(d). Ancillary Services: Sales of ancillary services are sourced to the customer's place of primary use. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3673(e). For purposes of all telecommunications sourcing rules, the place of primary use is the street address representative of where the customer's use of the telecommunications service primarily occurs, which must be the residential street address or the primary business street address of the customer. In the case of mobile telecommunications services, place of primary use must be within the licensed service area of the home service provider. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3673(f)(9). Application of Sourcing Rules to Certain Businesses The Kansas Department of Revenue has issued Kansas Notice 03-10, which details the application of the sourcing rules to certain businesses. The topics covered in this Notice are fees and charges for admissions, membership dues, and for participation in sports and recreation; florists;dry cleaning and laundry services; linen and uniform services; repair shops and other similar businesses; and funeral services. Kansas Notice 03-10. Fees and charges for admissions, and for participation in sports and recreation, shall be sourced to the place where admission is gained or where the sporting event or other recreational activity is held. Kansas Notice 03-10. For sales other than wire-order sales, the sale shall be sourced to the florist's business location when a customer takes delivery there. When the florist makes delivery to another location in Kansas, the sale shall be sourced to that location. If delivery is made out-of-state, Kansas sales tax does not apply to the transaction. The delivery address determines how the sale is sourced, without regard to where the credit-card billing address is or where the invoice is delivered to the customer. Kansas Notice 03-10. Laundries and dry cleaners located in Kansas are required to collect the state and local sales tax in the place where delivery is made to the customer in Kansas. Kansas Notice 03-10. Linen and uniform services located in Kansas are required to collect the local sales tax in the place where delivery is made to the customer in Kansas. Kansas Notice 03-10. Kansas repair shops are required to collect the state and local sales tax in the place where the repaired property is delivered to the customer in Kansas. Most often, customer delivery occurs either at the repair shop or at the customer's home or place of business. This rule applies when a shop picks up the property at the customer's location, repairs the property at their shop, and then returns the property to the customer at the customer's location. Kansas Notice 03-10. A service provider located in another state who enters Kansas and performs taxable repair services in Kansas is considered to be a “retailer doing business in this state”for purposes of Kansas retailers' sales tax. As such, the out-of-state service provider must register as a Kansas retailer and collect and remit Kansas state and local sales tax due on the charges for services performed in Kansas. Kansas Notice 03-10. All charges made by a funeral home for its funeral services and any related sales of tangible personal property shall be sourced to the location of the funeral home.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Leases and Rentals

Destination Generally, Kansas follows destination-based sourcing for leases and rentals. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3669(a); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3670(b). In general, leases and rentals are sourced as follows: • for a lease or rental that requires recurring periodic payments, the first periodic payment is sourced the same as a retail sale. Periodic payments made subsequent to the first payment are sourced to the primary property location for each period covered by the payment. The primary property location is as indicated by an address for the property provided by the lessee that is available to the lessor from its records maintained in the ordinary course of business, when use of this address does not constitute bad faith. The property location is not changed by intermittent use at different locations, such as use of business property that accompanies employees on business trips and service calls; and • for a lease or rental that does not require recurring periodic payments, the payment is sourced the same as a retail sale. These rules do not affect the imposition or computation of sales or use tax on leases or rentals based on a lump sum or accelerated basis, or on the acquisition of property for lease. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3669(a); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3670(b). The general sourcing rules for leases and rentals do not apply to leases and rentals of motor vehicles, trailers, semi-trailers, and aircraft that are not regarded as transportation equipment; water craft, modular homes, manufactured homes, or mobile homes; transportation equipment; or telecommunication services and ancillary services. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3669(b); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3670. BNA-SUTN KS 4.1.3.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Local Sourcing

Same as State The sourcing rules of Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3670, which are the rules for the state level, apply for sourcing at the local level as well. Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-191. A retail sale, not including leases or rentals, will be sourced to the location of the seller if the product is received by the purchaser at the seller's place of business. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3670(a)(1). When the product is not received at the seller's business location, then the sale is sourced to the location where the purchaser or purchaser's donee received the item. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3670(a)(2). If neither situation applies, then the sale is sourced to the address of the purchaser that is available from the business records of the seller when such records are maintained in the ordinary course of business and when use of the address does not constitute bad faith. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3670(a)(3). If this rule would not apply then the sale is sourced to the address for the purchaser obtained during the consummation of the sale, when use of this address would not constitute bad faith. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3670(a)(4). If none of these rules would apply, then the place where the items were shipped from will be the location of the sale. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3670(a)(5). However, in all cases the retail sale or transfer of watercraft, modular homes, manufactured homes, or mobile homes are considered consummated at the place of business of the seller and sourced to that location. Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-191. Also, the retail sale or transfer of motor vehicles, trailers, semi-trailers, or aircraft that are not transportation equipment are consummated at the place of business of the seller and sourced to that location. Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-191. Transportation equipment means any locomotive or railcars that are utilized for carriage of persons or property in interstate commerce, trucks and truck-tractors with a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,001 pounds or more, trailers, semi-trailers, or passenger buses that are registered through the international registration plan and operated under the authority of a carrier authorized and certified by the U.S. Department of Transportation or another federal or foreign authority to engage in the carriage of persons or property in interstate or foreign commerce, aircraft that are operated by air carries authorized and certified by the U.S. Department of Transportation or another federal or foreign authority to engage in the carriage of persons or property in interstate or foreign commerce. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3670(d). In the case of an isolated sale of a motor vehicle or trailer, the sale is consummated at the location where the sale is made. If negotiations occurred in different cities or counties, then the sale took place where the motor vehicle or trailer was kept at the time of the sale. Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-191. The lease or rental of property that has recurring payments will be sourced to two locations. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3670(b)(1). The first payment will be sourced the same as retail sale payments. The subsequent payments are sourced to the primary location of the property for each period covered by the payment. The primary location is determined by the address for the property provided by the lessee in the lessor's records that are maintained in the ordinary course of business and when use of the address does not constitute bad faith. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3670(b)(1). For leases or rentals that do not involve periodic payments, the payment is sourced under the same rules for retail sales. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3670(b)(2).

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Credit for Tax Paid to Another Jurisdiction

No Kansas specifies that if any article of tangible personal property has been subjected to a tax by Kansas or any other state with respect to its sale or use, in an amount that is less than the Kansas use tax, then Kansas use tax applies. Kan. Stat. Ann. § 79-3705; see Kansas Information Guide KS-1510. The applicable rate is measured by the difference only between the Kansas rate, and the rate by which the previous tax upon the sale or use was computed. Kan. Stat. Ann. § 79-3705; see Kansas Information Guide KS-1510. The exemption for tax already paid is not allowed if a tax paid in another state was not legally due and owing. Additionally, taxes that are imposed as a privilege tax that do not attach to the selling price of tangible personal property by law are not allowed as a credit against Kansas use tax. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-20-15. BNA-SUTN KS 4.2.
