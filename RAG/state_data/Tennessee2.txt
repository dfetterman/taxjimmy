Topic: Administration and Procedure Agencies Responsible for Administration Local Sales and Use Tax

Tennessee Commissioner of Revenue A sales or use tax levied by a local jurisdiction is administered, reported and collected by the state in the same manner as the state sales and use tax. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-702(a)(1) as added by 2007 Tenn. S.B. 2223, §164, effective July 1, 2009, as amended by 2019 Tenn. H.B. 931, effective April 12, 2019 (extending Tennessee's compliance with SSUTA until July 1, 2021); Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-710(a)(1). Therefore, any voluntary disclosure or amnesty programs administered at the state level would be available for taxpayers subject to local sales and use tax. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-702(a)(1) as added by 2007 Tenn. S.B. 2223, §164, effective July 1, 2009, as amended by 2019 Tenn.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Vendor/Seller Registration

Required A retailer that is responsible for collecting and remitting sales tax must file an application for a sales tax permit with the commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Revenue. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-601. Retailers that are responsible for filing an application for a permit include retailers that are located in or maintain a place of business in Tennessee, and out-of-state retailers that make sales to a destination within Tennessee where the retailer engages in the regular and systematic soliciting of potential customers in Tennessee. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-601; Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-602(a); Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. ch. 1320-5-1-.63. The sales tax permit is valid until forfeited or revoked. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-601; Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-604; Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-606; Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-607. Out-of-State Dealer Registration Out-of-state dealers that have a physical presence in Tennessee must register with the department regardless of whether they have more than $500,000 in sales to Tennessee consumers. Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. ch. 1320-5-1-.129(1); Tennessee Notice No. 17-01 (Jan. 2017); Tennessee Dept. of Rev., Sales and Use Tax Registration by Out-of-State Dealers. The Tennessee Department of Revenue has also passed Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. ch. 1320-5-1-.129(2)—also known as Rule 129(2)—which requires certain out-of-state dealers with no physical presence in the state to register with the department by March 1, 2017, and to collect and pay sales and use tax on applicable sales by July 1, 2017. However, in March 2017, a lawsuit challenging Rule 129(2) resulted in a temporary agreed order preventing the enforcement of Rule 129(2) while the suit is pending. Thus, while the suit is pending, out-of-state dealers are not required to register with the department or collect and remit sales and use tax under Rule 129(2). Additionally, effective May 25, 2017, the Tennessee General Assembly enacted 2017 Tenn. H.B. 261, which prohibits the department from collecting any sales and use taxes authorized under Rule 129(2)—even if permitted by a court ruling—until the general assembly fully reviews any court ruling permitting the tax and until the general assembly approves Rule 129(2) pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. §4-5-226. This content will be updated as more information becomes available. 2017 Tenn. H.B. 261; Tennessee Notice 17-12 (May 2017). Revocation of Vendor License The department may revoke a dealer registration certificate for failure to comply with the Tennessee tax code or regulations. Before a decision is reached by the commissioner of the Tennessee department of revenue, a taxpayer is given 10 days notice in writing, and allowed a hearing where the taxpayer may show cause why their certificate should not be revoked. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-604. Reissued Permits Following a Revocation A dealer whose certificate of registration has been revoked may apply for another certificate after 12 months. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-603. Flea Markets The department requires dealers selling tangible personal property at a flea market to register and pay an annual, quarterly, or monthly fee. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-220; see Tennessee Sales and Use Tax Guide—September 2018. Streamlined Sales Tax Agreement/Electronic Registration Vendors may register for a registration certificate through the central electronic registration system provided by the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Governing Board. Additionally, the department of revenue may allow a vendor to register through the use of an authorized agent under procedures adopted by the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Governing Board. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-608(a). Certificate of Registration A dealer's state Certificate of Registration for sales tax is sufficient evidence of registration with the department for purposes of locally imposed sales tax, and no additional certificate is required. In the event a dealer has no state Certificate of Registration within a county, city, or town imposing a local sales tax the dealer must apply for and obtain a separate Certificate of Registration from the commissioner of revenue for each unit of local government imposing a local sales tax. Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. tit. 1320, ch. §1320-5-2-.07. Effective July 1, 2013, a levy or change of a local sales and use becomes effective only on the first day of a calendar quarter and no sooner than sixty-one days after the commissioner has issued general notification of the new tax or change in the rate to dealers affected. However, the failure of a dealer to receive notice does not relieve it of the obligation to collect, remit or pay a local sales and use tax. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-716(1). BNA-SUTN TN 31.2.

R. & Regs ch. §1320-5-1-.78(1). Further, retail vendors that are required to have a state sales tax license covering retail sales made to final consumers are required to have a certificate of exemption to cover the purchaser's sales for resale. Wholesalers or other dealers that make sales to retail vendors must take possession of a resale certificate from the purchaser claiming the exemption, and must maintain the certificates for inspection by the department of revenue. A vendor may present evidence to a wholesaler or dealer showing that the business is a registered retailer, and afterward the retailer will not need to execute additional resale certificates to the wholesaler as long as there is no change in the retailer's business. Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs ch. §1320-5-1-.68(1). See Tennessee Letter Ruling No. 17-10 (July 5, 2017) (ruling that a taxpayer's customers must have separate exemption certificates for each of their locations; customers with one location comprised of several buildings only needed to have one certificate per location with the main building's physical address listed). Requirements The seller or certified service provider needs to obtain identifying information of the purchaser and the reason for claiming a tax exemption at the time of the purchase. The identifying information includes: name, address, type of business, reason for exemption and a tax identification number issued by this state or other governmental authority as required by the commissioner. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-409(a)(1). Sellers must maintain proper records of all exempt sales made to certificate holders, and must present this information to the department of revenue when requested to do so. Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs ch. §1320-5-1-.78(1). Consequences of Failing to Obtain Exemption Certificates If a wholesaler or dealer makes exempt sales and does not keep and maintain the associated exemption certificates, all sales will be deemed to be retail sales and the wholesaler or dealer will be held liable for state sales or use tax. Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs ch. §1320-5-1-.78(2). Exemption Certificate Substitutions, Data Elements Sellers must use and maintain the appropriate exemption certificates in order to be relieved from the liability of tax. Tenn. Comp.
