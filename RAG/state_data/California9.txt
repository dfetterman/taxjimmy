Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Taxation of Property

Taxable California sales and use tax is imposed on retailers for the privilege of selling tangible personal property in the state. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6051; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6202. In addition, every person storing, using, or otherwise consuming tangible personal property in California is generally liable for use tax until the sales tax has been paid or an authorized retailer has issued the purchaser a receipt relieving the purchaser of further liability. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6202; see California Tax Publication 388—June 2016 (discussing use tax owed on property purchased from an out-of-state vendor). It is presumed that all gross receipts are subject to tax until the contrary is established. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6091. It is further presumed that all property delivered out-of-state to California residents will be stored or consumed in-state and therefore is subject to use tax. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6247. The burden of proving that a sale or use of tangible personal property is not subject to tax is upon the person who makes the sale unless a resale certificate has been provided by the purchaser. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6091. The use tax presumption may be controverted by a statement in writing, signed by the purchaser, that the property was purchased for use outside of the state. If the retailer fails to obtain such a statement, the presumption may be rebutted by other evidence that the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration Effective July 1, 2017, the California State Board of Equalization's (SBOE) jurisdiction over tax administration for sales and use tax was transferred to the Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA). See 2017 Cal. A.B. 102, effective July 1, 2017. For more information, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at California 31.1.1. finds satisfactory. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6247. The California Department of Tax and Fee Administration has released a comprehensive tax matrix to aid remote sellers in determining whether they should be collecting tax on specific items.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Taxation of Services

Enumerated Services Only Services are generally not subject to California's sales and use tax. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6051. However, to prevent the erosion of the tax base, California does tax certain stand-alone services that might otherwise be included in the sales price of tangible personal property subject to tax. In this regard, the state taxes the producing, fabricating, processing, printing, or imprinting of tangible personal property for a consideration for consumers who furnish either directly or indirectly the materials used in the producing, fabricating, processing, printing, or imprinting. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6006(b). Additionally, when transactions involve a mixed transfer of tangible personal property and services, the entire sales price may be subject to tax if the true object of the transaction is the tangible personal property. For additional discussion of mixed transactions and the true object test, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at California 9.3.1. Service providers must pay tax on their purchases of tangible personal property used or consumed in performing nontaxable services. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6012; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1501. In-Home Support Services Retail sales of support services will become subject to California's sales tax if specified federal approval requests for matching funds are granted. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6151. Support services include the following services provided by a provider:• domestic services and related services; • heavy cleaning; • personal care services; • needed accompaniment during travel to health-related appointments; • yard hazard abatement; • protective supervision; • teaching and demonstration aimed at reducing the need for other supportive services; and • paramedical services aimed at making it possible for the recipient to establish and maintain an independent living arrangement. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6150(i). BNA-SUTN CA 9.2.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

True Object Test California law imposes a tax on the retail sale of tangible personal property, but not on the sale of intangible personal property or on the performance of services. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6006; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6007; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6051; Dell, Inc. v. Superior Court of San Francisco, 159 Cal. App. 4th 911 (Cal. Ct. App., 1st Dist. 2008). Drawing the line between taxable sales of tangible property and nontaxable sales of services or intangibles is sometimes difficult, especially where property that was largely created by personal services is transferred. Dell, Inc. v. Superior Court of San Francisco, 159 Cal. App. 4th 911 (Cal. Ct. App., 1st Dist. 2008). For example, assume that an architect is engaged to design a building. The end result of the architect's efforts may be a set of drawings that have the physical characteristics of tangible personal property. However, the architect has also performed a service. Tangible Personal Property and Services States typically refer to transactions involving the transfer of inseparable service and property elements as “mixed transactions.” However, in at least one case, California has referred to these as “bundled transactions.” See Dell, Inc. v. Superior Court of San Francisco, 159 Cal. App. 4th 911 (Cal. Ct. App., 1st Dist. 2008). When a transaction involves the transfer of services and tangible personal property that are inseparably intertwined, California looks to whether the purchaser's “true object” was to obtain the tangible personal property or the services. Dell, Inc. v. Superior Court of San Francisco, 159 Cal. App. 4th 911 (Cal. Ct. App., 1st Dist. 2008). If the true object of the transaction is the service, then the entire transaction is not subject to tax, even if some tangible personal property is transferred. In this case, the person performing the service is considered to be the consumer of the property and tax applies to the sale of such property to him or her. If, however, the true object of the transaction is to provide tangible personal property to the customer, then the service is considered part of a taxable sale and the entire transaction is subject to tax. Dell, Inc. v. Superior Court of San Francisco, 159 Cal. App. 4th 911 (Cal. Ct. App., 1st Dist. 2008). The California Department of Tax and Fee Administration Effective July 1, 2017, the California State Board of Equalization's (SBOE) jurisdiction over tax administration for sales and use tax was transferred to the Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA). See 2017 Cal. A.B. 102, effective July 1, 2017. For more information, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at California 31.1.1. has issued a series of regulations and rulings distinguishing between services and sales. See, e.g., Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1501 (Service Enterprises Generally); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1501.1 (Research and Development Contracts); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1502 (Computers, Programs, and Data Processing); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1502.1 (Word Processing); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1503 (Hospitals and Other Medical Service Facilities, Institutions, and Homes for the Care of Persons); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1504 (Mailing Lists and Services); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1505 (Morticians); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1506 (Miscellaneous Service Enterprise); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1507 (Technology Transfer Agreement); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1540 (Advertising Agencies, Commercial Artists, and Designers); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1541 (Printing and Related Arts); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1543 (Publishers); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1546 (Installing, Repairing, Reconditioning in General); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1549 (Fur Repairers, Alterers, and Remodelers). Tangible Personal Property and Intangible Property California views sales of tangible property bundled with intangibles, rather than services, differently. Navistar Intl. Transp. Corp. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 8 Cal. 4th 868, 884 P.2d 108 (Cal. 1994) (transfer of trade secrets recorded on paper is properly classified as transfer of taxable tangible personal property, and distinguishable from nontaxable transfer of intangible personal property such as copyrights and patents. Moreover, transfer of computer programs, which qualify as nontaxable custom computer programs in hands of original owner, lose nontaxable status and are subject to California sales tax upon sale by original owner). The California Supreme Court has rejected the position that “a transfer of tangible property is not taxable if the transfer is incidental to the transfer of intangible property.” Dell, Inc. v. Superior Court of San Francisco, 159 Cal. App. 4th 911 (Cal. Ct. App., 1st Dist. 2008). For instance, the court has held the transfer of drawings and designs embodying technology for the manufacture of industrial turbine engines to be taxable even if the principal object of the sale is to transfer the intangible or intellectual content embodied in the documents. Dell, Inc. v. Superior Court of San Francisco, 159 Cal. App. 4th 911 (Cal. Ct. App., 1st Dist. 2008) (citing Navistar Intl. Transp. Corp. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 8 Cal. 4th 868, 884 P.2d 108 (Cal. 1994). In a technology transfer agreement, the amount charged for intangible personal property transferred with tangible personal property is exempt from taxation if the agreement separately states a reasonable price for the tangible personal property. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6011(c)(10)(A). If such an agreement does not separately state a price for the tangible personal property transferred, and the same or like tangible personal property has previously been leased, sold, or offered for sale or lease to third parties, the price at which the same or like property has previously been leased, sold, or offered for sale or lease will be used to establish the retail value of the tangible personal property and the amount charged under the technology transfer agreement exclusive of that amount will be deemed charged for the intangible personal property transferred and will be exempt from taxation. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6011(c)(10)(B). Where a technology transfer agreement does not separately state a price for the tangible personal property transferred, and the same or like tangible personal property has not previously been leased, sold, or offered for sale or lease to third parties, the retail value of the tangible personal property will be deemed to be equal to 200 percent of the cost of materials and labor used to produce the tangible personal property and the amount charged under the technology transfer agreement exclusive of that amount will be deemed charged for the intangible personal property transferred and will be exempt from taxation. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6011(c)(10)(C). “Technology transfer agreement”is defined as an agreement under which a person who holds a patent or copyright interest assigns or licenses to another person the right to make and sell a product or to use a process that is subject to the patent or copyright interest. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6011(c)(10)(D); see also Preston v. California State Bd. of Equal., 25 Cal. 4th 197, 19 P.3d 1148 (Cal. 2001) (copyright interest in artwork, transferred in conjunction with temporary transfer of tangible artwork itself for purpose of reproduction constitute a technology transfer agreement, and not subject to sales tax. However, transfer of artwork even temporarily constitutes lease and is not exempt from taxation); Simplicity Pattern Co. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 27 Cal. 3d 900, 615 P.2d 555 (Cal. 1980) (although items such as film negatives and master recordings are partially valued for their intellectual content they are tangible personal property subject to sales tax). But see Navistar Intl. Transp. Corp. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 8 Cal. 4th 868, 884 P.2d 108 (Cal. 1994) (partially overruling Simplicity Pattern, stating, “The statement in Simplicity Pattern that an author does not ‘render anything of value separate from the manuscript itself' is correct to the extent it refers to an author's performance of a service in addition to providing the manuscript. To the extent that the statement may be read as referring to ‘anything of value' other than a service, it is disapproved”). BNA-SUTN CA 9.3.1.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Bundled Transactions

Depends States typically refer to transactions involving the transfer of taxable and nontaxable items for a single, non-itemized price in which the taxable and nontaxable items are each a significant object of the transaction as “bundled transactions.” A bit confusingly, California has referred to these in at least one case as “mixed transactions.” See Dell, Inc. v. Superior Court of San Francisco, 159 Cal. App. 4th 911 (Cal. Ct. App., 1st Dist. 2008). When these transactions involve a nontaxable service element and a taxable property element, California analyzes the elements as separate transactions, with the property component being taxed and the service component not. California does not appear to have adopted a uniform approach to bundled transactions that include both taxable property and nontaxable property. California Tax Publication 31—Oct. 2016. Of note, the state has adopted an approach that it appears to apply uniquely to combination packages containing nontaxable food items and taxable non-food items. In the case of these combination packages, if the retailer does not maintain records necessary to segregate the taxable and nontaxable portions of such packages and the retail value of the package's taxable contents exceeds 10 percent of the value of all package contents, the entire retail sales price of the package will be subject to tax. However, the entire package will be nontaxable if:• the retail value of the non-food items is 10 percent or less of the total value of the package's contents (excluding the value of the package container itself); and • the package container's retail value is 50 percent or less of the entire combination package value.
