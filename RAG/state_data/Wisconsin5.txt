State: Wisconsin



Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Real Property

Nontaxable Wisconsin does not impose sales or use tax on sales of real property. Wis. Stat. §77.52(1); Wis. Stat. §77.53. Wisconsin sales and use tax statutes do not directly define real property, but the property tax code defines real property as including not only the land itself, but all buildings, improvements, fixtures, rights, and privileges associated with the land. Wis. Stat. §70.03. In Wisconsin, “tangible personal property”means personal property that can be seen, weighed, measured, felt, or touched, or that is in any other manner perceptible to the senses, and includes electricity, gas, steam, water, and prewritten computer software, regardless of how it is delivered to the purchaser. Wis. Stat. §77.51(20). Cemetery Monuments The taxability of cemetery monuments in Wisconsin turns on the question of whether the transaction for the monument qualifies as the sale of real property, or tangible personal property. The transaction will be considered a sale of real property if the cost of the monument includes the cost of installation. If installation is not part of the sale for the monument, the transaction is treated as a sale of tangible personal property. Wisconsin Publication 211. The publication also provides examples of sales that the state characterizes as sales of tangible personal property. Wisconsin Publication 211. The analysis is similar for cemetery monuments that dealers purchase. That is to say, if the cemetery monument dealer purchases items and later resells those items as tangible personal property, then the monument dealer may purchase the items tax-free by giving to the seller a properly completed Wisconsin Sales and Use Tax Exemption Certificate (Form S-211) or Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Exemption Certificate — Wisconsin (Form S-211-SST), claiming resale. Wisconsin Publication 211. Unless an exemption applies, the monument dealer must charge sales tax when it later resells the items as tangible personal property. For items purchased and later consumed in the sale of real property, the monument dealer must pay sales or use tax to the seller when purchasing the tangible personal property. If the tax is not paid by the monument dealer to the seller, then the dealer must pay use tax directly to the Department of Revenue. This is true even for sales of real property to exempt entities (e.g., churches). Wisconsin Publication 211. BNA-SUTN WI 28.1.

Three-part Test Wisconsin applies a three-part test to determine whether personal property affixed to real property retains its character as tangible personal property or constitutes a nontaxable real property “fixture.” All City Commc'ns Co. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Rev., 263 Wis. 2d 394, 661 N.W.2d 845 (Wis. Ct. App. 2003); Dept. of Rev. v. A. O. Smith Harvestore Prods., Inc., 72 Wis. 2d 60, 240 N.W.2d 357 (Wis. 1976). The test has three elements:(1) Is the property physically annexed to the real estate in question? (2) Is the property applied or adapted to the use or purpose to which the real property is devoted? (3) Does the person doing the annexing have an objection and presumed intention to a make a permanent annexation to the real property, in light of the nature of the article, the degree of annexation, and the appropriateness of the article to the use to which the real property is put? Visu-Sewer Clean &; Seal, Inc. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Rev., 306 Wis.2d 447, 742 N.W.2d 74 (Wis. Ct. App. 2007); ; Dept. of Rev. v. A. O. Smith Harvestore Prods., Inc., 72 Wis. 2d 60, 240 N.W.2d 357 (Wis. 1976). Waterslides as Fixtures The repair, service, alteration, fitting, cleaning, painting, coating, towing, inspection, or maintenance of any waterslide is subject to Wisconsin sales or use tax. The service provider may purchase without tax, for resale, any materials that are physically transferred to the customer in the repair or other service to a waterslide. Wisconsin Publication 191; Wisconsin News for Tax Practitioners—May 10, 2016. As of Oct. 1, 2015, sellers of waterslide fixtures are required to pay sales or use tax on the purchase price of materials that are physically transferred to the customer on the sale and installation of waterslides in water parks. If a seller entered into an irrevocable contract to sell and install a waterslide in a water park prior to Oct. 1, 2015, the sale will be treated as if it took place prior to Oct. 1, 2015.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal Sale and Installation of Appliances, Electronics, Machinery, and Equipment

Depends The taxability of the sale and installation of appliances, electronics, machinery, and equipment depends on whether the items retain their character as tangible personal property. Built-in Appliances Appliances undergo an analysis similar to fixtures, but an appliance must be affixed, and also “built-in"to be considered exempt as a real property improvement. The tax treatment of the sale of a built-in appliance is dependent upon a number of factors outlined by the Department of Revenue. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.68(5); Wisconsin News for Tax Professionals – July 9, 2013. See also All City Commc'ns Co. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Rev., 263 Wis. 2d 394, 661 N.W.2d 845 (Wis. Ct. App. 2003). Planning Point: In a residential facility, the built in appliance must be permanently affixed to the real estate, or else it will be considered taxable tangible personal property. In a nonresidential facility, an appliance need not qualify as permanently affixed (thought it must be built-in), but it may not but used for a process or business function (e.g., refrigerator in a restaurant), or else it qualifies as tangible personal property. In a residential context, the focus is on whether the appliance is permanently affixed. In a nonresidential setting, the analysis focuses on whether the appliance is built into the building (a nontaxable real property improvement), or the business inside the building (taxable tangible personal property). Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.68(5); Wisconsin News for Tax Professionals – July 9, 2013; see also All City Commc'ns Co. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Rev., 263 Wis. 2d 394, 661 N.W.2d 845 (Wis. Ct. App. 2003).

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Construction Materials and Contracts Construction Materials and Contracts, Generally

Nontaxable Charges for construction labor billed to a contractee are not subject to sales and use tax in Wisconsin. Wisconsin Publication 207. Contractors and subcontractors are consumers of tangible personal property used by them in real property construction activities, and therefore they are subject to sales and use tax on the tangible personal property purchased. Wis. Stat. §77.51(2); Wisconsin Publication 207. “Real property construction activities” are activities that occur at a location where tangible personal property that is applied or adapted to the purpose to which real property is devoted is affixed to that real property. A person who affixes the tangible personal property must have the intent to make a permanent accession to the real property. Wis. Stat. §77.51(12t); see also Wisconsin Dept. of Rev. v. Sterling Custom Homes Corp., 283 N.W.2d 573, 91 Wis. 2d 675 (Wis. 1979) (finding that the taxpayer was a contractor engaged in real property construction activities and, therefore, a consumer of construction materials). Real property construction activities include improving, altering, installing, repairing, or otherwise servicing real property. Wis. Stat. §77.51(12t); Wisconsin Publication 207. A contractor must pay Wisconsin sales and use tax on its purchases of materials that are stored, used, or consumed in Wisconsin, even if the materials are used in real property activities outside of Wisconsin. Wisconsin Tax Bulletin No. 196. A contractor acts as a retailer—not as a provider of real property construction activities—if the contractor sells or services tangible personal property or affixes to real property tangible personal property that retains its character as tangible personal property after it is affixed. A contractor is also treated as a retailer if the contractor affixes property subject to tax under Wis. Stat. §77.52(1)(c). Wis. Stat. §77.51(12t); Wisconsin Publication 207. Property subject to tax under Wis. Stat. §77.52(1)(c) means leased property that is affixed to real property, the lessor of which has the right to remove the leased property upon breach or termination of the lease agreement, where the lessor of the affixed property is not also the lessor of the underlying real property. Wis. Stat. §77.52(1)(c). Moreover, Wisconsin taxes, and a contractor acts as a retailer when performing, the repair, service, alteration, fitting, cleaning, painting, coating, towing, inspection, or maintenance of the following real property components:• furnaces; • boilers; • stoves; • ovens, including associated hoods and exhaust systems; • heaters; • air conditioners; • humidifiers; • dehumidifiers; • refrigerators; • coolers; • freezers; • water pumps; • water heaters; • water conditioners and softeners; • clothes washers; • clothes dryers; • dishwashers; • garbage disposal units; • radios and radio antennas; • incinerators; • television receivers and antennas; • record players; • tape players; • jukeboxes; • vacuum cleaners; • furniture and furnishings; • carpeting and rugs; • bathroom fixtures; • sinks; • awnings; • blinds; • gas and electric logs; • heat lamps; • electronic dust collectors; • grills and rotisseries; • bar equipment; • intercoms; • recreational, sporting, gymnasium, and athletic goods and equipment including, by way of illustration but not of limitation, all of the following: ○ bowling alleys; ○ golf practice equipment; ○ pool tables; ○ punching bags; ○ ski tows; and ○ swimming pools; • equipment in offices, business facilities, schools, and hospitals but not in residential facilities including personal residences, apartments, long-term care facilities, prisons, mental health institutes, centers for the developmentally disabled, Type 1 juvenile correctional facilities, or similar facilities, including, by way of illustration but not of limitation, all of the following equipment: ○ lamps; ○ chandeliers; ○ fans; ○ venetian blinds; ○ canvas awnings; ○ office and business machines; ○ ice and milk dispensers; ○ beverage-making equipment; ○ vending machines; ○ soda fountains; ○ steam warmers and tables; ○ compressors; ○ condensing units and evaporative condensers;and ○ pneumatic conveying systems; • laundry, dry cleaning, and pressing machines; • power tools; • burglar alarm and fire alarm fixtures; • electric clocks;and • electric signs. Wis. Stat. §77.52(2)(a)(10); §77.52(2)(ag). A contractor who is acting as a retailer may purchase tangible personal property that is either sold or physically transferred to the customer in the installation, repair or servicing of tangible personal property exempt as a sale for resale. Wisconsin Publication 207. A contractor engaged primarily in real property construction activities may use resale certificates only with respect to purchases of tangible personal property that the contractor has sound reason to believe he or she will sell to customers for whom the contractor will not perform real property construction activities involving the use of such tangible personal property. Wis. Stat. §77.51(2); Sullivan Bros., Inc. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Rev., 2014 BL 26540, 2014 WI App 24, 352 Wis.2d 755, 843 N.W.2d 711 (Wis. Ct. App. 2014) (contractor not entitled to resale exemption on ceiling materials because the materials were used in the contractor's construction projects). Construction Contract Exemption Effective for contracts first entered into or extended, modified, or renewed on or after December 1, 2017, Wisconsin exempts construction contracts that include taxable products from sales and use tax if more than 90 percent of the total contract price relates to nontaxable real property construction activities. In other words, the total sales price of all products included under the contract must be less than 10 percent of the total amount of the construction contract. Wis. Stat. §77.54(60); Wisconsin Tax Bulletin No. 200;Wis. Dept. of Rev., Construction Contract Exemption - Updated (July 6, 2018). When this is the case, the contractor's charges to its contractee are exempt from tax and the contractor is treated as the consumer of the taxable products liable to pay tax on these items. Wis. Stat. §77.54(60); Wisconsin Tax Bulletin No. 200;Wis. Dept. of Rev., Construction Contract Exemption - Updated (July 6, 2018). If 90 percent or less of the total contract price relates to nontaxable real property construction activities, the contractor must collect and remit tax on the taxable products included under the contract. Wisconsin Tax Bulletin No. 200. For purposes of making the calculation, “products”includes tangible personal property, and items, property, and goods under Wis. Stat. §77.52(1)(b), (c), and (d), and both taxable and nontaxable services. Wisconsin Tax Bulletin No. 201;Wis. Dept. of Rev., Construction Contract Exemption - Updated (July 6, 2018). This is similar to the lump-sum construction contract exemption that applied to contracts entered into from October 1, 2013, through November 30, 2017, except that it is not limited to lump-sum contracts and it applies to sales and purchases by subcontractors. See Wisconsin Tax Bulletin No. 200. Lump-sum Construction Contract Exemption - Effective Oct. 1, 2013, through Nov. 30, 2017 For contracts entered into from October 1, 2013, through November 30, 2017, When a contractor enters into a lump-sum contract and the amount the contractor would normally charge for the taxable items sold under the contract is 10 percent or more of the total contract price, a reasonable allocation needs to be made between the taxable and nontaxable portions of the contract. Wisconsin Publication 207. The contractor must charge and collect sales tax on the portion of its charge allocated to the taxable sales, unless an exemption applies, and the contractor may purchase the taxable items without tax for resale. Wisconsin Publication 207. Taxable tangible personal property and services sold by a contractor as part of a lump-sum contract are exempt if the total sales prices of all such taxable products is less than 10 percent of the total amount of the lump-sum contract. The contractor is the consumer of such taxable products and is liable for sales or use tax on its purchase of these taxable products. Wis. Stat. §70.51(11d); Wis. Stat. §70.54(60), as amended by 2013 Wis. A.B. 40, effective July 2, 2013; see Wisconsin Publication 207. BNA-SUTN WI 28.3.1.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Mobile and Manufactured Homes

Exempt The sale of a mobile or manufactured home and land on which it is permanently affixed is the sale of a real property improvement not subject to sales tax. The sale of a mobile or manufactured home which is a real property improvement on the land of the seller, and which is acquired by the purchaser for removal from the seller's land for permanent attachment to the purchaser's land, is the sale of real property. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.88(3)(a). A mobile or manufactured home is personal property if it is located in a mobile home park or other place where the land on which the mobile or manufactured home is located is not owned by the mobile or manufactured home owner. A mobile or manufactured home is a realty improvement if it is permanently affixed to land owned by the owner of the mobile or manufactured home. Permanently affixed to land for sales tax purposes means the mobile or manufactured home sits on a foundation and is connected to utilities. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.88(1). “Mobile home” means a vehicle manufactured or assembled before June 15, 1976, designed to be towed as a single unit or in sections upon a highway by a motor vehicle and equipped and used, or intended to be used, primarily for human habitation, with walls of rigid uncollapsible construction, which has an overall length in excess of 45 feet. “Mobile home”includes the mobile home structure, its plumbing, heating, air conditioning and electrical systems, and all appliances and all other equipment carrying a manufacturer's warranty. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.88(1)(b). “Manufactured home”means a structure that is designed to be used as a dwelling with or without a permanent foundation and that is certified by the federal department of housing and urban development as complying with the standards established under 42 USC 5401 to 5425.339. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.88(1)(b). If the seller of a mobile or manufactured home agrees to permanently affix the home on a foundation on land owned by the purchaser, the seller is a contractor engaged in improving realty. The sale of mobile or manufactured homes to the contractor, however, are subject to tax. The gross receipts from the subsequent sale by the contractor to the purchaser of the home are not taxable. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.88(3)(b). The total gross receipts from the sale of a used mobile or manufactured home are exempt from the sales and use tax. Wis. Stat. §77.54(31); Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.88(4)(a). Thirty-five percent of the total gross receipts from the sale of new mobile and manufactured homes is exempt from sales and use tax. Wis. Stat. §77.51; Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.88(4)(b). No credit is allowed for trade-in allowances on the purchase of these new mobile and manufactured homes. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.88(4)(b). Sales of manufactured homes to a contractor for use in real property construction activities outside Wisconsin are exempt from Wisconsin sales and use tax. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.88(3)(c). Modular Homes The sale of a modular home and the land to which it is permanently affixed is the sale of a realty improvement not subject to sales tax. If the seller of a modular home, as part of the sales transaction, agrees to permanently affix the home on a foundation, the seller is a contractor-consumer engaged in improving realty. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.88(4m)(a). In this scenario, the sale of the modular home to the contractor-consumer is subject to the tax, but the sales price from the subsequent sale by the contractor-consumer to the purchaser of the home is not taxable. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.88(4m)(b). “Modular home” means any structure or component thereof which is intended for use as a dwelling and is of closed construction and fabricated or assembled on-site or off-site in manufacturing facilities for installation, connection, or assembly and installation, at the building site, or a building of open construction which is made or assembled in manufacturing facilities away from the building site for installation, connection, or assembly and installation, on the building site and for which certification is sought by the manufacturer. Modular home does not mean any manufactured or mobile home, as manufactured and mobile homes are not assembled on the building site. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.88(1)(bm); Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.88(1)(b). The sales price of a “modular home”that is not affixed to land when sold is subject to sales tax, but the sales tax may be reduced by 35 percent or an amount equal to the sales price minus the cost of the materials that become an ingredient or component part of the modular home. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.88(4m)(c). Once a retailer reduces the sales price or purchase price of a modular home by either of these two methods, the retailer must continue to use that method of reduction for all sales of modular homes, until such time as the Department approves in writing the use of the other method. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.88(4m)(d). Sales of modular homes to a contractor for use in real property construction activities outside Wisconsin are exempt from Wisconsin sales and use tax. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.88(4m)(e). BNA-SUTN WI 28.8.
