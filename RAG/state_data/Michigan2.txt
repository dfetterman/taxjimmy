Accepted An exempt purchaser who holds an exemption certificate and who regularly makes tax-exempt purchases of the kind and nature for which the exemption certificate has been made may provide a seller with a blanket exemption certificate. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.62(9); Mich. Comp. Laws §205.68(6); Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2016-14 (June 30, 2016). A blanket certificate specifies that all tangible personal property subsequently purchased will be for the purpose shown on the certificate, such as a purchase for resale. This relieves the purchaser of providing a separate exemption certificate for each qualifying tax exempt purchase, as long as there is not more than a twelve-month lapse in the recurring business relationship. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.62(9); Mich. Comp. Laws §205.68(6); Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2016-14 (June 30, 2016). On Feb. 8, 2018, the Michigan Department of Treasury issued a notice stating that a nonprofit entity is no longer required to provide a copy of an exemption letter ruling or IRS exemption letter to a seller or lessor.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Direct Pay Permits

Authorized If the taxpayer's business makes it very difficult upon purchase to determine the applicability of sales or use tax upon purchases of tangible personal property, then the Department of Treasury may issue permits that allow the purchaser to make purchases without paying sales tax to the vendor. Instead, the purchaser remits the sales tax directly to the department. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.98(1); Mich. Comp. Laws §205.54a(1)(q), as amended by 2018 Mich. H.B. 4561, effective April 25, 2018. To qualify for a direct pay permit, the taxpayer must meet certain requirements. These requirements include that:• the permit must be used for the purchase or lease of tangible personal property or services; • it is impractical upon the acquisition to determine the manner in which the property or services will be used; • direct payment will facilitate improved compliance with the sales and use tax laws of the state; • the person requesting the permit maintains acceptable, accurate, and complete records of all purchases or leases and uses of property or services purchased pursuant to the direct payment authorization; and • the taxpayer keeps records that support the taxable and exempt use of the purchases, leases, or services purchased pursuant to the direct payment authorization. Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2000-3 (June 12, 2000). On Feb. 8, 2018, the Michigan Department of Treasury issued a notice stating that a direct pay permit holder is no longer required to provide a copy of its authorization letter to a seller or lessor. Prior to this notice, a direct pay permit holder was required to provide a copy of its authorization letter to a seller or lessor in addition to an exemption certificate and its account number.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Record-Keeping Requirements

4 Years Sales and use tax records should be maintained for at least four years in Michigan, which is the statute of limitations for both underpayments and overpayments. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.27a(2). Michigan requires individuals and businesses making taxable sales to keep and preserve suitable records of the proceeds of sales, gross receipts of sales, exemptions, and inventories. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.28(3); Mich. Comp. Laws §205.68; see Michigan Administrative Decision 449145 (Mar. 5, 2014) (where taxpayer failed to maintain required records, the Department of Treasury could base assessment on taxpayer's Z-ring tapes); CSB Investors v. Michigan Dept. of Treas., No. 322897,(Mich. Ct. App. 2015) (affirming Tax Tribunal's decision that department's assessment was accurate in light of taxpayer's failure to maintain adequate records showing sales in question were actually made). This includes any books or other accounts that may be necessary to determine the amount of tax for which he or she is liable. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.68. Individuals or businesses that make both retail sales in addition to wholesale sales must maintain their books and records in a manner that shows the separate gross proceeds from either taxable or nontaxable sales. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.52(2). For wholesale sales, the seller must keep a record of the purchaser's sales tax license number, unless the purchaser does not hold a sales tax license. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.104a(1). If the books do not adequately reflect the distinction between taxable and nontaxable sales, then all sales will be subject to sales tax. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.52(2). BNA-SUTN MI 31.9.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Refunds

Both Taxpayers who have paid sales or use tax, and who believe an overpayment has occurred, or who have wrongfully collected tax, may file a petition for a refund with the Department of Treasury. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.30(2). Michigan's Court of Appeals, in an appeal of a matter the court earlier reversed and remanded to the Michigan Tax Tribunal, found in favor of a taxpayer seeking a refund of over $400,000 in sales tax erroneously paid over the course of several years on nontaxable candy and bottled water at its movie theater concession stands. The Department of Treasury initially denied the refund claim on the grounds that the taxpayer could not keep the refund of sales tax that taxpayer had wrongfully collected from its customers. At the remand hearing before the tribunal, the taxpayer asserted that it had not collected tax from its customers, but rather paid the tax itself. The taxpayer explained that the concession prices were set without consideration of the sales tax and it considered the tax a cost of doing business. The tribunal ruled that the taxpayer had not charged its customers sales tax, finding that the Department of Treasury had not rebutted the testimony of the taxpayer's representative on which the tribunal relied. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the tribunal's decision that the taxpayer had not collected sales tax from its customers concluding that the decision was based on competent, material, and substantial evidence. Thus, the taxpayer was entitled to the refund. MJR Grp., LLC v. Michigan Dept. of Treas., No. 329119, 2016 BL 434906, 2016 BL 435989 (Mich. Ct. App. 2016) (unpublished). Refunds will be granted to each taxpayer respectively when a joint tax return has been filed. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.30a. Effective Jan. 1, 2019, a purchaser may request a refund directly from the Michigan Department of Treasury in circumstances where that purchaser failed to present a claim of exemption or otherwise notify the seller of an available exemption at the time of purchase. A purchaser may request a refund only in the event that purchaser failed to claim an available exemption in the original transaction, so other potential refund claims by purchasers may not be made directly by the purchaser. For example, refund claims related to returns of tangible personal property upon which tax was paid or refund claims related to retroactive changes in law will not be eligible for direct refund to the purchaser. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.62(11), as amended by 2017 Mich. H.B. 5620, effective Jan. 1, 2019; Mich. Comp. Laws §205.104b(10), as amended by 2018 Mich. H.B. 5621, effective Jan. 1, 2019; Michigan Treasury Update - November 2018; Michigan Treasury Update -September 2018. A refund will only be granted if the following conditions are met:• the claim for a refund is made within 4 years of the date of purchase; • the purchaser submits to the Michigan Department of Revenue an accurate record of the purchase, including, but not limited to, a paper, electronic, or digital receipt, invoice, or purchase order related to the sale, that includes the date of the purchase and the amount of sales tax paid to the seller for which the purchaser is seeking a refund; • the purchaser submits to the Michigan Department of Revenue a form signed by the seller as prescribed by the department that contains information required by the department to substantiate the refund claim; • the purchaser submits to the Michigan Department of Revenue a proper exemption claim on a form as prescribed by the department; and • the purchaser submits to the Michigan Department of Revenue any additional information that the department may require related to the purchaser's claim for refund. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.62(11), as amended by 2017 Mich. H.B. 5620, effective Jan. 1, 2019; Mich. Comp. Laws §205.104b(10), as amended by 2017 Mich. H.B. 5621, effective Jan. 1, 2019; Michigan Treasury Update - November 2018; Michigan Treasury Update -September 2018. Prior to Jan. 1, 2019, only sellers who collected and remitted sales and use tax may make refund claims. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.62(11), as amended by 2017 Mich. H.B. 5620, effective Jan. 1, 2019; Mich. Comp. Laws §205.104b(10), as amended by 2017 Mich. H.B. 5621, effective Jan. 1, 2019; Michigan Treasury Update - September 2018. Taxpayers seeking the refund of use tax related to items purchased from Michigan vendors are not entitled to a presumption that they paid tax to these vendors and, instead, bear the burden of proving that the tax was, in fact, paid. Andrie Inc. v. Michigan Dept. of Treas., 853 N.W.2d 310 (Mich. 2014); Michigan Administrative Decision 418353(Sept. 23, 2014). Refund Applied to Outstanding Liability If the department determines that a refund is due, the amount of the refund plus accrued interest will first be credited by the department against any outstanding final tax liabilities the taxpayer owes to the department. Later, any remaining balance will be refunded to the taxpayer. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.30a(1); Mich. Comp. Laws §205.30(2). BNA-SUTN MI 31.10.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Statute of Limitations Assessment of Additional Tax

4 years Under most circumstances, the Department of Treasury can assess unpaid sales or use taxes for four years after the later of a tax return's due date or filing date. However, if the taxpayer fails to file a return, then the department can assess the tax at any time. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.27a(2). Unlike in most states, if a taxpayer files a fraudulent return, then Michigan provides a two-year statute of limitations period that begins when the fraud is discovered. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.27a(2). Extending the Statute of Limitations After 2014 Mich. S.B. 337 For audits commenced after Sept. 30, 2014, 2014 Mich. S.B. 337 changed the way the statute of limitations is tolled. Under this legislation, the department must complete fieldwork and provide a written preliminary audit determination no later than one year after the four-year statute of limitations period expires. Further, the department must issue a final assessment within nine months of the preliminary audit determination. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.21(7), enacted by 2014 Mich. S.B. 337, effective Feb. 6, 2014. The four-year statute of limitations period may be extended for the period pending the final determination of tax through an audit conference, hearing, or litigation, the period for which the taxpayer and the state have consented to extend the period in writing, the one-year period for completion of audit fieldwork and the nine-month period for issuing a final assessment, or for a period of 90 days after a decision and order from an informal conference, or a court order that resolves an appeal in which a final assessment was not issued prior to the appeal. Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2015-26 (Dec. 2, 2015). Interim Period from Feb. 6, 2014, through Sept. 30, 2014 In Alticor, Inc. v. Dept. of Treasury, the Michigan Court of Appeals held that the legislative silence regarding audits commenced on or before September 30, 2014, reflected an intent to allow tolling in those cases. It reasoned that the necessary corollary of providing for extensions of the limitations period for audits commenced after September 30, 2014, is that audits commenced on or before that date remain subject to tolling. Alticor, Inc. v. Dept. of Treasury, No. 337463, 2018 BL 181856 (Mich. Ct. App. May 22, 2018); Michigan Treasury Update -September 2018. Prior to the decision Alticor, Inc. v. Dept. of Treasury, Michigan policy was that the 2014 Mich. S.B. 337 state audit extension provision applied only to audits commenced after Sept. 30, 2014, thereby creating a gap period where no tolling or extension applied. Thus, Departmental policy was that final assessments resulting from audits commenced in this “gap”period must therefore be issued within the four-year statute of limitations unless the taxpayer and the Department otherwise agree. See Mich. Comp. Laws §205.21(6), enacted by 2014 Mich. S.B. 337, effective Feb. 6, 2014; Mich. Comp. Laws §205.21(7), enacted by 2014 Mich. S.B. 337, effective Feb. 6, 2014; Michigan Letter Ruling LR 2015-2 (June 10, 2015); Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2015-26 (Dec. 2, 2015). Before 2014 Mich. S.B. 337 Before the Michigan legislature enacted 2014 Mich. S.B. 337, a state audit suspended (or tolled) the four-year statute of limitations for the audit period plus an additional year. The taxpayer and the state could also consent in writing that the statute of limitations period be extended. Further, an audit could continue indefinitely, because an audit stopped the statute of limitations from running and restarted it only when the audit concluded. Once restarted, the statute of limitations continued to run for the remaining time in the four-year statute. Michigan calculated the new expiration date adding to the audit completion date the number of days remaining in the four-year statute of limitations when the audit commenced, plus one year. See Mich. Comp. Laws §205.27a(3)(a); see also Michigan Letter Ruling LR 2015-2 (June 10, 2015); Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2015-26 (Dec. 2, 2015). BNA-SUTN MI 31.11.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Civil Penalties

Yes Michigan imposes a range of civil and criminal penalties on individuals or businesses that violate tax laws and regulations relating to sales and use tax. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.20. The Michigan Department of Treasury has created a subsection of penalties titled Discretionary Penalties. These discretionary penalties describe negligence, intentional disregard and fraud, which require the department reviewer when applying the penalty to evaluate the facts, circumstances, and degrees of action or omission and apply the penalty. These penalties vary by amount and severity depending on the nature of the violation. Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2005-3 (July 19, 2005). The Michigan Department of Treasury may impose the following civil penalties for violation of the rules and regulations relating to sales and use taxes: Penalty for Failure to Pay or File Sales or Use Tax Michigan imposes a penalty in the amount of the deficiency plus interest for the failure to pay sales or use tax. The deficiency is the estimated payment that may be required. The interest rate is determined as the current monthly interest rate of 1 percent point above the adjusted prime rate per annum from the time tax was due until it is eventually paid. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.23(2). Moreover, Michigan imposes a penalty of 5 percent of the tax in the first two months, with an additional 5 percent for each additional month or fraction of a month during which the obligation is past due. However, the escalating monthly penalty may not exceed a maximum of 25 percent. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.24(2). A taxpayer is eligible to avoid that penalty if he or she can represent to the department that the failure to file or pay was due to reasonable cause. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.24(4). Penalty for Failure or Refusal to File an Information Return or Report Michigan imposes a penalty of $10 per day for each separate failure or refusal to file an informational return or report. The maximum penalty for this violation is $400. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.24(5). Penalty for Negligence Without the Intent to Defraud If a taxpayer's negligence of the Michigan rules and regulations leads to a deficiency or excessive claim, then Michigan imposes a penalty of the greater amount of $10 or 10 percent of the total amount of the deficiency, plus interest. However, the penalty may be avoided if the taxpayer can show reasonable cause for the deficiency or excessive claim. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.23(3). Penalty for Intentional Disregard of the Law Without the Intent to Defraud If a taxpayer's intentional disregard of the law of the law or rules is without the intent to defraud, then Michigan imposes a penalty of the greater amount of $25 or 25 percent of the total amount of the deficiency in the tax, plus interest. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.23(4). Penalty for Fraudulently Failing to File or Evade Tax Michigan imposes 100 percent of the deficiency, plus interest, as a penalty on any taxpayer who, with the intent to evade or defeat the collection of the sales tax, fraudulently files a return or fraudulently fails to file a return. In addition to the penalty for fraudulently filing a sales tax return, if the return includes a fraudulent claim for refund or credit, the taxpayer will suffer a penalty equal to 100 percent of the refund or credit that is claimed. The penalty is due and payable after notice and informal conference is held. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.23(5). Examples of fraud include situations in which the taxpayer:• buys a vehicle from another individual and substantially understates the purchase price on the use tax return; • buys a vehicle from an unrelated individual but claims a related person use tax exemption; • knows of a tax obligation and willfully fails to comply with it; • has a cost of goods sold, less cost of non-taxable merchandise, that substantially exceeds reported taxable sales; • falsely claims a deduction where no deduction exists; or • claims a false exemption deduction. Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2005-3 (July 19, 2005). Non-Negotiable Remittance Taxpayers that remit a non-negotiable remittance payment to pay a tax obligation are subject to a 25-percent penalty. Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2005-3 (July 19, 2005). Frivolous Protest Michigan penalizes taxpayers that attempt to avoid or delay tax payment by raising frivolous or meritless arguments, equal to the greater of $25 or 25 percent of the tax due.

Yes The Michigan Department of Treasury, attorney general, and prosecuting attorney may impose criminal penalties for violating Michigan's sales and use tax laws. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.27(5). Felony sales tax crimes are punishable by fines (up to $5,000) and imprisonment for up to five years. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.27(2). Felony sales tax crimes include knowingly:• failing to file or pay a return with the intent to defraud or to evade or assist in defrauding or evading the payment of a tax, or a part of a tax; and • swearing or verifying a false or fraudulent return, or a payment containing a fraudulent statement, with the intent to aid, abet, or assist in defrauding the state. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.27(3). Misdemeanor sales tax penalties are punishable by fines (up to $1,000) and imprisonment for up to one year. Misdemeanor sales tax crimes include:• knowingly violating any other provision of the Michigan sales and use tax code, aside from the intent to defraud or evade tax; Mich. Comp. Laws §205.27(4). and • engaging in business without a sales tax license, either after expiration of suspension. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.53(3).

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Waiver of Penalties

Yes The Michigan Department of Treasury is authorized to waive civil negligence, late filing, and late payment penalties upon finding that the taxpayer's understatement of tax, overstatement of credit, failure to file, or failure to pay was due to reasonable cause. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.23(3); Mich. Comp. Laws §205.24(4). Additionally, if a taxpayer does not satisfy a tax liability or makes an excessive claim for a refund as a result of reliance on erroneous current written information provided by the Department, the State Treasurer will waive all criminal and civil penalties provided by law for failing or refusing to file a return, for failing to pay a tax, or for making an excessive claim for a refund for a tax administered by the Department of Treasury if the taxpayer makes a written request for a waiver, files a return or an amended return, and makes full payment of the tax and interest.

Yes Effective October 5, 2010, 2010 Mich. S.B. 884 was signed into law. That Act amended Mich. Comp. Laws § 205.31 and provided for a tax amnesty program for the period beginning May 15, 2011 and ending June 30, 2011. Mich. Comp. Laws § 205.31, as amended by 2010 Mich. S.B. 884, effective Oct. 5, 2010. During this amnesty program period, the state treasurer waived all criminal and civil penalties provided by law for failing or refusing to file a return, for failing to pay a tax liability, or for making an excessive claim for a refund for a tax as a result of reliance on erroneous current written information provided by the department. Mich. Comp. Laws § 205.31, as amended by 2010 Mich. S.B. 884, effective Oct. 5, 2010. A taxpayer seeking to participate in the 2011 amnesty program needed to make a written request for a waiver on a form provided by the department, submit any unfiled returns or amended returns, and make full payment of the tax and interest due for any prior period not later than the last day of the amnesty period. Mich. Comp. Laws § 205.31, as amended by 2010 Mich. S.B. 884, effective Oct. 5, 2010. The 2011 amnesty program applied to the non-reporting and under-reporting of tax liabilities and to the nonpayment of taxes that were previously determined to be due, but only to the extent of the penalties that were attributable to the taxes that were previously due and that were paid during the amnesty period. However, the amnesty program did not apply to taxes that were due after Dec. 31, 2009. Mich. Comp. Laws § 205.31, as amended by 2010 Mich. S.B. 884, effective Oct. 5, 2010. Michigan law provides that the state treasurer is prohibited from waiving criminal and civil penalties that are applicable if a taxpayer is eligible to enter into a voluntary disclosure agreement for the tax, if the tax is attributable to income derived from a criminal act, if a taxpayer is under criminal investigation or involved in a civil action or criminal prosecution for the tax, or if a taxpayer has been convicted of a felony under Michigan tax law or the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
