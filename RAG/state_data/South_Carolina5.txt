State: South Carolina



Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Real Property

Nontaxable Real property is not subject to sales or use tax in South Carolina, as it falls outside of South Carolina's definition of taxable “tangible personal property.” S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-60. South Carolina sales and use tax statutes do not provide a definition for real property. However, a basic definition from the state's property tax statutes indicates that real property includes land, lots, and all structures and annexations or attachments that pass to the buyer by conveyance of the land or lot. S.C. Code Ann. §12-37-10(1). BNA-SUTN SC 28.1.

Four-Factor Test In South Carolina, fixtures are nontaxable improvements to real property. Carson v. Living Word Outreach Ministries, Inc., 431 S.E.2d 615 (S.C. Ct. App. 1993) (defining a fixture as “an article which was a chattel, but by being physically annexed to the realty by one having an interest in the soil becomes a part and parcel of it”). South Carolina courts have defined the term “fixture” as any piece of tangible personal property that has been affixed or attached to real property in such a way that the tangible personal property loses its identity as such, and becomes a part of the real property. Carson v. Living Word Outreach Ministries, Inc., 431 S.E.2d 615 (S.C. Ct. App. 1993) (defining a fixture as “an article which was a chattel, but by being physically annexed to the realty by one having an interest in the soil becomes a part and parcel of it”). However, mere attachment or affixation to real property does not automatically render a piece of tangible personal property a fixture of the real property. Creative Displays, Inc. v. South Carolina Highway Dept., 248 S.E.2d 916 (S.C. 1978). The courts of South Carolina have enumerated four factors that are to be considered when determining whether a piece of tangible personal property has become affixed to the real property. The four factors to be considered are:• the mode of attachment; • the character of the tangible personal property; • the intent of the parties making the attachment or annexation; and • the relationship of the parties. Hyman v. Wellman Enters., Inc., 522 S.E.2d 150 (S.C. Ct. App. 1999); South Carolina Private Letter Ruling No. PLR 09-1 (Feb. 29, 2009). BNA-SUTN SC 28.2.1.

The incidence of the tax depends on whether the seller is either a retailer or a contractor. A retailer, who is substantially in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail, is to purchase items at wholesale, regardless of whether the items are sold or are withdrawn by the retailer for use. Both sales and withdrawals by the retailer are reported under the state's sales tax law. 117 S.C. Code Regs. §324. BNA-SUTN SC 28.2.2.

Depends Whether charges for the sale and installation of signage is taxable depends on the type of charge made in connection with the sale and installation of signage. South Carolina Private Letter Ruling No. 07-4 (July 13, 2007). Charges for services provided in conjunction with, or as a part of, sales at retail of signs are includable in “gross proceeds of sales” and, therefore, subject to the tax unless the sale of the sign is otherwise exempt under the law. Such charges include, but are not limited to, charges for consultation, engineering and design, surveys, and permits. South Carolina Private Letter Ruling No. 07-4 (July 13, 2007). However, charges to install signs are exempt, provided such charges are separately stated. Additionally, charges to customers for tangible personal property which becomes a part of the real property, such as concrete used for the foundation of a stand alone sign, are exempt, provided such charges are separately stated.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Construction Materials and Contracts Construction Materials and Contracts, Generally

Taxable South Carolina law considers the sale of building materials to contractors for resale or use in the form of real estate as retail sales subject to sales tax. 117 S.C. Code Regs. §314. “Contractors”include any person, firm, association or corporation making repairs, or additions to real property. 117 S.C. Code Regs. §314.2. The incidence of the tax depends on whether the seller is either a retailer or a contractor. A retailer, who is substantially in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail, is to purchase items at wholesale, regardless of whether the items are sold or are withdrawn by the retailer for use. Both sales and withdrawals by the retailer are reported under the state's sales tax law. 117 S.C. Code Regs. §324. In determining whether a person is engaged in making taxable sales of tangible personal property or making nontaxable improvements to real property, South Carolina distinguishes between a retailer making taxable sales and installations, and a contractor providing nontaxable services. South Carolina Sales and Use Tax Manual, 2019 Edition (April 2019). A number of factors may be used to classify a business as either a retailer or a contractor including: • how the person advertises the business; • whether the person makes retail sales in which the person does not perform the installation; • whether the person displays products in a showroom and how the showroom is perceived by the general public; • whether the person is a licensed contractor; and • whether the person performs labor as a subcontractor. South Carolina Sales and Use Tax Manual, 2019 Edition (April 2019). The determination may also include a review of the person's contracts and agreements with customers. South Carolina Sales and Use Tax Manual, 2019 Edition (April 2019). Plumbers and landscapers, for example, are considered contractors who provide nontaxable services, unless they also regularly sell tangible personal property at retail. See South Carolina Sales and Use Tax Manual, 2019 Edition (April 2019). Even where a person is deemed a retailer, reasonable installation labor charges that are separately stated on the bill to the customer are not subject to tax. South Carolina Sales and Use Tax Manual, 2019 Edition (April 2019); see 117 S.C. Code Regs. §313.3; 117 S.C. Code Regs. §324. Building materials purchased by builders, contractors, or landowners for use in adding to, repairing or altering real property are subject to sales or use tax at the time of purchase. 117 S.C. Code Regs. §314.2; see S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-110 (retail sale includes sale of building materials to construction contractors, builders, or landowners for resale or use in the form of real estate). For sales and use tax purposes, building materials includes any material used in making repairs, alterations or additions to real property. South Carolina's extensive list of building materials includes “any and all other tangible personal property which becomes a part of real property.” 117 S.C. Code Regs. §314.2. The term “building materials” means materials used to add to, alter, or repair real property. 117 S.C. Code Regs. §314.2; see also Cox v. South Carolina Tax Comn., 329 S.E.2d 739 (S.C. 1985). Examples of building materials include:• lumber; • timber; • nails; • screws; • bolts; • structural steel; • elevators; • reinforcing steel; • cement; • lime; • sand; • gravel; • slag; • stone; • telephone poles; • fencing; • wire; • electric cable; • brick; • tile; • glass; • plumbing supplies; • plumbing fixtures; • pipe; • pipe fittings; • prefabricated buildings; • electrical fixtures; • built-in cabinets and furniture; • sheet metal; • paint; • roofing materials; • road building materials; • sprinkler systems; • air conditioning systems; • built-in-fans; • heating systems; • floorings; • floor furnaces; • crane ways; • crossties; • railroad rails; • railroad track accessories; • tanks; • builders'hardware; • doors; • door frames; • window frames; • water meters; • gas meters; and • well pumps. 117 S.C. Code Regs. §314.2. Construction Materials Imported from Out-of-state South Carolina presumes that out-of-state building materials transferred into South Carolina are brought into South Carolina for in-state use, storage, or consumption, and South Carolina imposes use tax on the transferred building materials. However, if a taxpayer pays use tax on out-of-state building materials but ultimately uses, stores, or consumes them in another state, then the South Carolina Department of Revenue allows for a tax credit. 117 S.C. Code Regs. §314.3. Construction Materials Fabricated by a Contractor Standard Finished Products: If a contractor produces standard finished products that it sells at wholesale or at retail on a regular basis, creates a new and substantially different article having a distinctive name and substantially different character or use than that of the raw materials used in making the product, and is commonly thought of as a manufacturer, then the contractor is a manufacturer of building materials. Such building materials used in performing a construction contract create a tax liability for the contractor. However, if the job site is located outside of South Carolina, then no tax is due. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-60; S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-910; South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 94-2 (March 1, 1994). Standard finished products are items not specifically designed for use on a particular construction project. Standard finished products are, as the name suggests, standard or interchangeable and have a resale value and a fair market value. These items are generally mass-produced and are suitable for use on many construction projects. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-60; S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-910; South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 94-2 (March 1, 1994). Unique Products: If a contractor produces unique products that are used in the performance of a construction contract, then the contractor is acting as a contractor. As such, sales to, and purchases by, the contractor of raw materials used to fabricate the unique product are subject to the sales and use tax. However, if the fabricated item will be used, and become a part of real property located outside of the state, then sales to, and purchases by, the contractor of the raw materials used in the fabrication of the unique product are not subject to the sales and use tax. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-60; S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-910; South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 94-2 (March 1, 1994). If a unique product is fabricated out-of-state, sales to or purchases by the contractor of the materials used to fabricate the unique product are not subject to the sales and use tax, provided that the materials were not sold and delivered to the contractor within South Carolina. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-60; S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-910; South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 94-2 (March 1, 1994). Unique products are items that are specifically designed for use on a particular construction project. Unique products are not standard or interchangeable and have no resale value or fair market value. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-60; S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-910; South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 94-2 (March 1, 1994). Construction Materials Used in Constructing a New or Expanded Manufacturing Facility Effective July 1, 2011, construction materials used in the construction of a new or expanded single manufacturing or distribution facility, or one that serves both purposes, with a capital investment of at least $100 million in real and personal property at a single site in the State over an 18-month period are exempt from sales tax. The exemption requires the taxpayer to meet investment requirements. Specifically, a $100 million investment, limited to real or personal property in South Carolina, must be made within an 18-month period. The 18-month investment period begins on the date provided by the taxpayer in the intent to invest notification that it provides to the Department or before notification is communicated, provided the taxpayer can document that such investment is part of an 18-month plan. The exemption applies to construction materials being used to build a new manufacturing or distribution facility, or used in the expansion of an existing manufacturing or distribution facility. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-2120(67); South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 15-2 (Feb. 18, 2015). Additionally, construction materials used in the construction of a new or expanded single manufacturing facility where the taxpayer invests at least $750 million in real or personal property or both comprising or located at the facility over a seven year period and creates at least 3,800 full-time new jobs during that seven year period are exempt from sales tax. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-2120(67). To qualify for the exemption for construction materials, the taxpayer must notify the South Carolina Department of Revenue before the first month it uses the exemption and must make the required investment over the applicable time period. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-2120(67). If the taxpayer does not invest the required amount in the applicable time period, the taxpayer will owe sales and use tax on the systems and equipment purchased with this exemption. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-2120(67). In addition, a taxpayer may not claim the exemption unless the taxpayer notified the Department of Revenue prior to October 31, 2015 of its intention to use the exemption. South Carolina Information Letter No. IL 15-18 (Dec. 2, 2015). Effective May 13, 2019, the term “distribution facility” is expanded to include a port facility as defined in S.C. Code Ann. §12-6-3375. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-2140, as added by 2019 S.C. S.B. 439, effective May 13, 2019. “Transient Construction Property” South Carolina imposes a 6-percent use tax on “transient construction property” stored, used, or consumed in South Carolina. The tax rate is 5 percent per the enacting statute (S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1320(A)), but South Carolina also imposes a 1-percent “additional sales, use and casual excise tax” on most purchases. Therefore, the tax rate is more accurately stated as 6 percent total; see S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1110 (imposing an additional 1-percent tax on all transactions except purchases of transient accommodations; purchases made using U.S.D.A. food coupons;and purchases subject to a maximum sales and use tax pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-2110, such as motor vehicles). The property's owner or lessee must pay the use tax. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1320(B). The use tax is due immediately upon bringing the transient construction property into South Carolina. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1320(H). The term “transient construction property”means motor vehicles, machines, machinery, tools, equipment, or other tangible personal property brought, imported, or caused to be brought into South Carolina for use, or stored for use, in constructing, building, or repairing any building, highway, street, sidewalk, bridge, culvert, sewer or water system, drainage or dredging system, railway system, reservoir or dam, power plant, pipeline, transmission line, tower, dock, wharf, excavation, grading, or other improvement or structure, or any part of it. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-150. South Carolina law explains in detail how to compute the use tax liability on transient construction property. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1320(C). The three-step computation is below:• First, divide the time that the property will be used in South Carolina by its total useful life. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1320(C)(1). • Second, multiply the result by the property's sales price. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1320(C)(2). • Third, multiply by the tax rate. See S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1320(C)(3). As discussed above, S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1320(C)(3) states to multiply by 5 percent, but S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1110 adds an additional 1 percent for most transactions, for a total of 6 percent. South Carolina law explains that the commission determines transient construction property's useful life by following the building and construction trade's experience and practices. Also, if there is not enough evidence available to determine how long the taxpayer intends to use the transient construction property in South Carolina, then South Carolina presumes that the in-state use period is the property's entire useful life. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1320(C). If a taxpayer pays sales or use tax to another state on a transaction involving transient construction property, then the taxpayer may take a credit on the prorated amount. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1320(D). The three-step computation process for the prorated amount is similar to the process above. For the transaction to qualify for this favorable treatment, the other state must allow for a substantially similar tax credit. If the other state does not prorate its use tax on (or depreciate the value of) transient construction property used by South Carolina contractors operating in that state, then South Carolina's use tax applies. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1320(E). South Carolina does not impose use tax on transient construction property purchased and substantially used in another state if the owner uses it to construct or repair his or her own buildings, structures, or other in-state property. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1320(F). However, if a property owner purchases property to use, store, or consume it in South Carolina, then it is subject to South Carolina's use tax at the full rate regardless of how long the taxpayer intends to use it in South Carolina. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1320(G). Construction Materials Used by Nonprofit Corporations South Carolina exempts from sales and use tax construction materials used by an en entity organized under I.R.C. §501(c)(3) as a nonprofit corporation to build, rehabilitate, or repair a home for the benefit of an individual or family in need. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-2120, as amended by 2015 S.C. H.B. 3568, effective Jan. 1, 2016. Construction Materials Used for the Construction, Repair, or Improvement of a Motorsports Entertainment Complex Applying to tax years beginning after 2017, qualified companies are exempt from state and local sales taxes on building materials, supplies, fixtures, and equipment for the construction, repair, or improvement of or that become a part of a motorsports entertainment complex. S.C. Code Ann. §12-69-30(A), as added by 2017 S.C. H.B. 4009, effective July 2, 2018. A company must apply with the South Carolina Department of Revenue in order to become a qualified company. The department will approve an application as long as it is accompanied by a practical plan to make a capital investment of at least ten million dollars on any motorsport entertainment complex in South Carolina within the five-year period immediately following the approval of the application. A company's exemption is effective upon receipt and remains effective until Dec. 31 of the fifth full calendar year after its issuance. Once the exemption certificate is ineffective, the company must return the exemption certificate to the department and submit a report to the department of the actual expenditures made in South Carolina in connection with the investment. S.C. Code Ann. §12-69-30(B) and (C), as added by 2017 S.C. H.B. 4009, effective July 2, 2018. A company that is approved and receives a sales and use tax exemption certificate but fails to meet the capital investment requirements within the five-year period, is liable for the sales and use taxes that would have been paid had the approval not been granted in the same proportion as the actual capital investment failed to meet the required capital investment. S.C. Code Ann. §12-69-30(D), as added by 2017 S.C. H.B. 4009, effective July 2, 2018.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Services to Real Property Real Property Repair, Separately Stated Parts and Materials Charges

Nontaxable Where a contractor separately charges for building materials used in real property repair services, sales tax is not due on the separately stated items, as the builder or contractor is considered the consumer or user of such parts and materials. 117 S.C. Code Regs. §306 (materials used in repairing are taxable to the repairman because the repair person is considered the consumer of the materials). Building materials purchased by builders, contractors, or landowners for use in adding to, repairing or altering real property are subject to sales or use tax at the time of purchase. 117 S.C. Code Regs. §314.2; see S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-110 (retail sale includes sale of building materials to construction contractors, builders, or landowners for resale or use in the form of real estate). For sales and use tax purposes, building materials includes any material used in making repairs, alterations or additions to real property. South Carolina's extensive list of building materials includes “any and all other tangible personal property which becomes a part of real property.” 117 S.C. Code Regs. §314.2. Materials used in repairing that do not lose their identity when used by the repair person and are a substantial part of the repair job, are sold at retail to the repairman's customer. Tax is due on such sales, including tax on the service incidental thereto, unless the repair person makes separate agreements to sell the repair parts and to perform the repair service. Tax may be remitted only on the price of the parts, provided the repairman's records and invoices clearly show a separation of amounts received from the sales of parts and the rendering of services. 117 S.C. Code Regs. §306(a). Materials that lose their identity when used by the repair person, such as paint, solder, and tack, are considered to have been used or consumed by the repairman and are taxable at the time of sale to the repairman. 117 S.C. Code Regs. §306(b). Retailers who also provide repair services, generally purchase materials as exempt purchases for resale. The subsequent retail sale of materials or withdrawal of materials for use is subject to tax. See 117 S.C. Code Regs. §324 (dual business). Where a retailer's charges for repair services are separately stated from the cost of the materials, the labor charges are not subject to tax, although the separately stated materials costs are taxable. See 117 S.C. Code Regs. §306. BNA-SUTN SC 28.4.2.

Code Regs. §313.3. Thus, installation labor charges for services such as, attaching headboards to walls, hanging mirrors, and installing ceiling lamps, window blinds, and lighting fixtures, constituted nontaxable installation charges.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Contractor Classifications

Defined South Carolina generally treats sellers installing items upon real property as either contractors or retailers. A number of factors are used to make this classification. South Carolina Sales and Use Tax Manual, 2019 Edition (April 2019). These factors include:• how the person advertises the business; • whether the person makes retail sales in which the person does not perform the installation; • whether the person displays products in a showroom and how the showroom is perceived by the general public; • whether the person is a licensed contractor; and • whether the person performs labor as a subcontractor. South Carolina Sales and Use Tax Manual, 2019 Edition (April 2019). If treated as a contractor, a seller must pay sales and use tax at the time that construction materials are purchased and charges to the contractee are not subject to tax. If the seller is instead treated as a retailer, construction materials purchased for resale are not subject to tax. The retailer must collect and remit sales tax on the later retail sale of the materials, regardless of whether the sale includes installation. Any separately stated installation charges are not subject to tax. South Carolina Sales and Use Tax Manual, 2019 Edition (April 2019). In limited instances, retailers may be treated as a “dual business” acting as both a retailer and a contractor. In this case, the business must purchase all items that may later either be sold at retail or used under a construction contract exempt from tax as items purchased for resale. The subsequent retail sale or withdrawal for use of these items is subject to tax. See 117 S.C. Code Regs. §324. Dual business treatment does not apply to contractors, plumbers, repairmen, or others who make isolated or accommodation sales and who have not set themselves up as being engaged in selling at retail. Tax should be paid on all tangible personal property purchased by these businesses and no tax is required to be collected and remitted on isolated or accommodation sales that they make. See 117 S.C. Code Regs. §324. BNA-SUTN SC 28.5.

Code Regs. §314.11 (addressing federal government construction contracts). Purchases by a subcontractor will generally not give rise to a use tax liability on the part of a general contractor and any exemption of the general contractor will not flow through to a subcontractor unless an agency relationship exists between the general contractor and subcontractor. S.C. Code Ann. §40-11-20(22); See 117 S.C. Code Regs. §314.11 (addressing federal government construction contracts). BNA-SUTN SC 28.6.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Mobile and Manufactured Homes

Depends Manufactured homes and modular homes are taxed differently under South Carolina sales and use tax law. 117 S.C. Code Regs. §335. Manufactured Homes A manufactured home is defined as a structure that is transportable in one or more sections which, in the traveling mode, is eight body feet or more in width or 40 body feet or more in length or when erected on site is 320 or more square feet, is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used as a dwelling with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities, and includes the plumbing, heating, air conditioning, and electrical systems contained in it. S.C. Code Ann. §40-29-20; 117 S.C. Code Regs. §335.1. The basis upon which the sales and use tax is calculated for the sale of a manufactured home is 65 percent of the “gross proceeds of sales” for the transaction. Provided that the manufactured home meets certain energy efficient standards, the maximum tax due on the sale is $300. However, if the manufactured home does not meet certain energy efficient standards, then the maximum tax on the sale is $300 plus 2 percent of the basis upon which the tax is calculated that exceeds $6,000. Additionally, local sales and use taxes that are administered and collected by the South Carolina Department of Revenue on behalf of local jurisdictions do not apply to manufactured homes. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-2110(B); 117 S.C. Code Regs. §335.1. Furthermore, the additional 1-percent sales and use tax imposed under S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1110 does not apply to sales of manufactured homes. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1110; S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-2110(B). From July 1, 2009 to July 1, 2019, there was a total exemption from sales tax for manufactured homes designated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Department of Energy as meeting or exceeding each agency's energy saving efficiency requirements or designated as meeting or exceeding such requirements under each agency's ENERGY STAR program. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-2110(B); South Carolina Information Letter No. IL 19-18 (June 28, 2019). Modular Homes A modular home is defined as any building of closed construction, regardless of type of construction or occupancy classification, other than a mobile or manufactured home, that is constructed off-site in accordance with applicable codes and transported to the point of use for installation or erection, and cannot be considered a manufactured home even if the home meets the definitional requirements of a manufactured home. S.C. Code Ann. §23-43-20; 117 S.C. Code Regs. §335.2. The maximum tax provisions do not apply to sales of modular homes, and any local sales and use taxes that are administered and collected by the department on behalf of local jurisdictions also do not apply to modular homes. 117 S.C. Code Regs. §335.2. South Carolina law exempts from sales tax 50 percent of the gross proceeds of the sale of a modular home. The gross proceeds of the sale are equal to the manufacturer's net invoice price, which includes accessories built into the modular home, but does not include freight or deposit on returnable materials. It is the responsibility of the modular home manufacturer to collect, report, and remit sales tax to the South Carolina Department of Revenue. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-2120(34). BNA-SUTN SC 28.8.
