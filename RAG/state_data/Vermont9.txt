Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Taxation of Services

Depends Vermont imposes its sales and use tax on a limited number of enumerated services. See Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, §9771. Services not listed as taxable are not subject to tax. The taxable services are predominantly those that relate to the fabrication, printing, or imprinting of tangible personal property. Services that include the transfer of tangible personal property as a function of the service are not taxable as long as the tangible personal property is inconsequential to the value of the service and a separate charge is not made. See, e.g., Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, § 9771 (sales tax imposed on receipts from tangible personal property and on charges for producing, fabrication and printing); Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, § 9701(4) (excluding from taxable receipts the price received for labor for installing or repairing if separately charged). The services subject to tax are:• public utility services including gas and electricity, but excluding water and transportation; Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, §9771(2). • producing, fabricating, printing or imprinting of tangible personal property for a consideration for consumers who furnish either directly or indirectly the materials used in the producing, fabricating, printing, and imprinting; Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, §9771(3). • directory assistance; Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, §9771(6). • admission charges; Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, §9771(4). and • telecommunication service except coin-operated telephone service, paging service, private telecommunications service, or value-added non-voice data service. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, §9771(5). Items purchased by service providers that are used in providing their services are subject to sales tax. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, §9701(4)(A)(ii); see Vermont Technical Bulletin TB-58 (Jan. 3, 2011) (servicing of tangible personal property is subject to sales tax when a single price is charged for the entire transaction, but separately-stated labor charges are exempt).

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

Focus of Transaction Vermont utilizes a “focus of the transaction test” to determine whether a transaction involving the transfer of tangible personal property and the performance of a service has as its main “focus”the provision of taxable tangible personal property or the provision of an exempt service. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, §9741(35). If the focus of the transaction is the performance of a personal service or transfer of intangible property rights, rather than the transfer of tangible personal property, and no separate charge is made for the transfer of the tangible personal property, then the transaction does not take on the taxable character of the tangible property transferred. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, §9741(35). Generally, if less than 10 percent of the total charge of the transaction is for the transfer of tangible personal property, then the focus of the transaction is the provision of personal services or intangible property rights and the transaction is exempt from tax. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, §9741(35). If the focus of the transaction is the transfer of tangible property, then all receipts from the sale are taxable, including any charges incurred for services. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, §9741(35). When the focus of the transaction is the transfer of tangible property, the charges for services are taxable regardless of whether the charges for services to produce the property are separately stated, unless the receipts from the sale are otherwise exempt from tax. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, §9741(35). BNA-SUTN VT 9.3.1.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Bundled Transactions

Taxable Generally, the entire sales price of a bundled transaction is subject to a sales tax if any product included in the bundled transaction would be taxable if sold separately. Vt. Code R. §1.9701(4)-3; Vermont Formal Ruling No. 2015-01 (since neither the conference bridge nor the meeting collaboration products are subject to Vermont sales and use tax, a “bundled”charge for both would also not be subject to Vermont sales and use tax). A “bundled transaction”is the retail sale of two or more products, not including real property and services to real property, if the products sold are distinct and identifiable products and sold for one nonitemized price. Vt. Code R. §1.9701(4)-3. The following are not considered “distinct and identifiable products,” and thus a bundled transaction does not include:• packaging that accompanies the retail sale of products that are incidental to the retail sale; • products provided free of charge with the required purchase of another product; • items included in the definition the Vermont definition of “sales price.” Vt. Code R. §1.9701(4)-3(A); see Vt. Code R. §1.9701(4)-1 for a definition of sales price. To qualify as a bundled transaction, the products which are the subject of the sale must be sold for one non-itemized price. A price that is separately identified by product on a binding sales or other supporting sales-related documentation which is made available to a customer in either paper or electronic form, does not qualify as “one non-itemized price” for purposes of satisfying the requirements of a bundled transaction. Forms of sale documentation where the price may be stated include, but are not limited to, an invoice, bill of sale, receipt, contract, service agreement, lease agreement, periodic notice of rates and services, rate card, or price list. Vt. Code R. §1.9701(4)-3(B). The following transactions are an exception to the definition, and by regulation are specifically not considered to be bundled transactions:• The retail sale of tangible personal property and a service where the tangible personal property is essential to the use of the service, in which the true object of the transaction is the service. Vt. Code R. §1.9701(4)-3(C)(1); Vermont Formal Ruling No. 2012-12 (safe provided by taxpayer for use by customers to hold cash for taxpayer's pickup, where the true object of the transaction is the security service, is not a bundled transaction and is exempt from sales tax). • The retail sale of services where one service is provided that is essential to the use of a second service in which the true object of the transaction is the second service. Vt. Code R. §1.9701(4)-3(C)(2). • A transaction that includes taxable and nontaxable products and the purchase price is de minimis. Vt. Code R. §1.9701(4)-3(C)(3). • A retail sale of exempt and taxable tangible personal property in which the single-price transaction includes food and food ingredients, drugs, durable medical equipment, mobility enhancing equipment, over-the-counter drugs, prosthetic devices or medical supplies. Vt. Code R. §1.9701(4)-3(C)(4)(a). • The sales price of the tangible personal property is 50 percent or less of the total purchase price of the bundled tangible personal property. Sellers may not use a combination of the purchase price of the tangible personal property when making the 50 percent determination for a transaction. Vt. Code R. §1.9701(4)-3(C)(4)(b). Bundled Transactions Involving Telecommunications Services Vermont provides that bundled transactions consisting of telecommunications services where the price is attributable to products that are tax exempt and taxable, the entire bundle may be subject to tax unless the seller can identify by reasonable and verifiable standards the exempt portion from its books and records. Vt. Code R. §1.9701(4)-3(D)(1). If the elements of a bundled transaction have different applicable tax rates, the highest tax rate may be applied to the total price of the product unless the provider may, using reasonable and verifiable standards to identify from its books and records, the portion of the price that is attributable to the products that should be subject to the lower tax rate. Vt. Code R. §1.9701(4)-3(D)(2). BNA-SUTN VT 9.3.2.

Conforms to State The local option tax is applied in accordance with the Vermont law governing the application of the state sales tax. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, §138(c). Vermont imposes sales tax on the sale of tangible personal property, which is defined as personal property which may be seen, weighed, measured, felt, touched or in any other manner perceived by the senses. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, §9701(1); Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, §9771(1).

A regional transit district is created by act of the voters of two or more municipalities and written approval by the agency of transportation. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, §5122. Approval by the Agency of Transportation is based upon the results of studies to determine the suitability of the municipality for a transit district. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, §5122. Each municipality of a regional transit district has at least one representative. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, §5123. BNA-SUTN VT 9.4.
