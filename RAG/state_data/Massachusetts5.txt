Depends Whether plumbing is taxable depends on whether the service provided constitutes the installation of a complete unit of a standard item of tangible personal property that does not require any further fabrication.

Massachusetts treats contractors that sell and install complete units of a standard item of tangible personal property, which do not require any further fabrication, as retailers.

However, the general sales tax construction contractor rule does not apply to sales in which contractors act as retailers selling tangible personal property in the same manner as other retailers, and install a complete unit of standard equipment requiring no further fabrication but simply installation, assembling, applying or connecting services. Contractors acting as retailers of tangible personal property are not construction contractors and must collect tax on the sales price of the item from the buyer. Massachusetts Directive 14-2.

Exempt Tangible personal property purchased for construction under an exempt contract is exempt from Massachusetts sales and use tax. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 64H, §6(f). An exemption applies to the sale of building materials and supplies to a contractor that are to be used in the construction, reconstruction, alteration, remodeling, or repair of:• any building structure, public highway, bridge, or other public works owned by or held in trust for the benefit of any governmental body or agency and used exclusively for public purposes; Mass. Gen. L. ch. 64H, §6(f). • any building or structure owned by or held in trust for the benefit of any corporation, foundation, organization, or 501(c)(3) institution and used exclusively in the conduct of its religious, scientific, charitable, or educational purposes; Mass. Gen. L. ch. 64H, §6(f). and • any building, structure, residence, school, or other facility included under any written contract dated on or after Jan. 1, 1985, arising out of or related to the Massachusetts Port Authority residential and school soundproofing programs, notwithstanding whether such building, structure, residence, school, or other facility is owned by or held in trust for the benefit of the Massachusetts Port Authority or is used exclusively for public purposes; Mass. Gen. L. ch. 64H, §6(f). and • any building or structure located in a Marine Industrial Park used exclusively for agricultural production, seafood processing, or seafood storage facility. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 64H, §6(f); 2014 Mass. H.B. 4553, effective, Jan. 1, 2015. The governmental body or agency or corporation, foundation, organization, or 501(c)(3) institution must first have obtained a certificate from the commissioner stating that it is entitled to this exemption. The vendor must keep a record of:• the sales price of each such separate sale; • the name of the purchaser; • the date of each such separate sale; and • the number of such certificate. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 64H, §6(f); Massachusetts Letter Ruling 12-12 (Oct. 19, 2012) (an otherwise non-exempt contractor's purchases of construction progress photographs are exempt from tax where the contractor acts as an agent of an exempt governmental body, is contractually required to turn the property over to the exempt body, and obtains an exemption certificate from the exempt body). Building materials and supplies include all materials and supplies consumed, employed, or expended in the construction, reconstruction, alteration, remodeling, or repair of any building, structure, public highway, bridge, or other such public work, as well as such materials and supplies physically incorporated therein. Building materials and supplies also include rental charges for construction vehicles, equipment, and machinery rented specifically for use on the site of any such tax exempt project or while being used exclusively for the transportation of materials for any such tax-exempt project. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 64H, §6(f). The Massachusetts Legislature amended Mass. Gen. L. ch. 64I, §2 to reverse the result of the Court of Appeals decision in the Morton Buildings case. Acts of 2004, chapter 262, §51, amending Mass. Gen. L. ch. 64I, §2. Specifically, the statute imposes a tax on the storage, use, or consumption of tangible personal property manufactured, fabricated, or assembled from materials acquired either within or outside the commonwealth for storage, use, or other consumption within the commonwealth. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 64I, §2. In Morton Buildings, the court determined that the taxpayer did not owe use tax on building materials it acquired and transformed into a new item outside the state and subsequently imported into the state because the imposition of the use tax applied only to raw materials imported into the state;it did not apply to such materials that were manufactured into new items and then imported into the state.
