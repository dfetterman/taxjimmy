Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Food and Food Ingredients General Rule

Taxable at 2.5% Generally, Virginia imposes sales tax on sales of food and food ingredients at a reduced combined state and local rate of 2.5 percent on the gross sales price as food purchased for human consumption. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-611.1; Virginia Tax Bulletin VTB 05-7 (May 31, 2005). The additional state sales and use tax rate of 0.7 percent—which applies in counties and cities located in a “Planning District” (Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads Regions)—does not apply to sales of food purchased for human consumption. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-603.1; Va. Code Ann. §58.1-604.01; as amended by2013 Va. H.B. 2313, effective July 1, 2013; Virginia Tax Bulletin VTB 13-8 (June 13, 2013). An addition regional sales and use tax is imposed in the “Historic Triangle” region, which includes the city of Williamsburg, James City County, and York County. This additional rate is not imposed on food purchased for human consumption. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-603.2, as added by 2018 Va. S.B. 942, effective July 1, 2018. This tax is contingent upon Williamsburg repealing ordinances that raise the local transient occupancy, food and beverage, and admissions taxes and will only become effective 30 days after the repeal. See Williamsburg, Va. Code §17-09, 17-10, 18-237. This tax will expire if any locality within the “Historic Triangle”raise or reinstates any such tax before Jan. 1, 2026. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-603.2, as added by 2018 Va. S.B. 942, effective July 1, 2018. Food and Beverages Ineligible for Reduced Sales Tax Rate Items that do not qualify as food for home consumption, and thus, are not eligible for the reduced sales tax rate, include:• alcoholic beverages, canning supplies, cleaning products, cooking utensils, cosmetics and beauty aids, freezer bags and containers, health aids, household items, medicines, minerals, paper products, pet and animal foods and supplies, soaps and detergents, tobacco products, toiletry items, tonics, and vitamins; • catered food and meals; • hot foods and hot beverages (including hot meals); • cold food and cold beverages served in open containers or on plates, platters and trays for immediate consumption; • eligible food packaged with ineligible food, nonfood items, or alcoholic beverages and sold together for a single price; • food marketed or advertised for heating in the store whether or not hot at the point of sale; • food and beverages kept hot to make them palatable and suitable for immediate consumption on or off the premises; and • cold sandwiches, cold salads, and cold beverages sold in combination with hot foods for a single price. Virginia Tax Bulletin VTB 99-11 (Oct. 1, 1999). Other sales of prepared food that do not qualify for a reduced tax rate include the following• gift basket that includes fruit packaged in a basket of other container and sold for a single price; • specialty gift basket containing meat, cheese or other eligible food together with a stuffed animal or alcoholic beverage and sold for a single price; • fried chicken, ribs, macaroni and cheese and other hot foods under heat lamps or other heat sources. • hot beverages in pots or in automatic dispensers with a heat source. • Combo meals that include a hot entree or a hot sandwich, hot side food, and a cold fountain drink, or any combination of hot and cold foods and beverages, and sold for a single price. Virginia Tax Bulletin VTB 99-11 (Oct. 1, 1999). In contrast to the above ineligible items, when hot and cold foods and beverages are sold individually in one transaction, the eligible item does qualify for the reduced sales tax rate. Virginia Tax Bulletin VTB 99-11 (Oct. 1, 1999). Ready-to-Cook Meal Delivery Ready-to-cook meals delivered to customers'homes are taxed at the reduced rate under the Food Tax Reduction Program.

Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Food and Food Ingredients Definition of 'Food and Food Ingredients'

Not Defined Virginia does not define “food and food ingredients,” but does provide that “food purchased for human consumption” has the same meaning as the term “food” in the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. §2012)and the regulations adopted pursuant to that act—with the exception of seeds and plants that produce food for human consumption. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-611.1(C). Generally, the term “food”under the Food Stamp Act of 1977 means any food or food product for home consumption except alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and hot foods or hot food products ready for immediate consumption. 7 U.S.C. §2012. Under FDA guidelines, conventional foods must have a “Nutrition Facts” panel on their labels whereas dietary supplements must have a “Supplement Facts”panel on their label. Virginia has used the presence of such labels to determine whether or not an item is eligible for the reduced food rate. Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 15-101 (May 12, 2015) (taxpayer's shakes did not qualify as food for home consumption and were subject to sales tax, where the “Supplemental Facts”considered the shakes to be dietary supplements); Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 15-102 (May 12, 2015) (taxpayer's granulated drink mix product was not an accessory or specialty dietary food item because it did not carry a “Nutrition Facts” panel, therefore taxable at the full sales tax rate).

Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Prepared Food General Rule

Depends Virginia provides that sales of cold prepared foods sold for home consumption are eligible for the reduced 2.5 percent sales tax rate, but sales of catered foods, hot foods and beverages, and cold food served in open containers or on plates, platters, or trays for immediate consumption is subject to the regular retail sales tax rate. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-603; Virginia Tax Bulletin VTB 05-7 (May 31, 2005). Virginia's definition of “food”includes most staple grocery food items, bottled water regardless of size, and cold prepared food packaged for home consumption. Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 06-98 (Sept. 29, 2006); Virginia Tax Bulletin VTB 05-7 (May 31, 2005); see also Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 16-50 (April 11, 2016) (prepackaged single-serve ice cream and soft serve ice cream sold by an ice cream truck are both predominantly sold for immediate consumption and are subject to the full retail sales tax rate rather than the reduced rate for food). The reduced rate applies without regard to the nature of the seller's business, and the following retailers should charge the reduced rate for exempt food items: bakeries, cafes, cafeterias, convenience stores, delicatessens, department stores, diners, doughnut and pastry shops, drug and sundry stores, farmer's markets, grocery stores, ice cream shops, lunch counters, mail order companies, supermarkets, sandwich shops, snack bars, specialty meat and produce stores, video stores, and weight reduction establishments. Conversely, the reduced rate does not apply to any food sold by a retail establishment where gross receipts from the sale of food for immediate consumption is more than 80 percent of the total gross receipts of that establishment. For purposes of determining the 80-percent rule, fast food restaurants must include drive-thru and to-go purchases, and therefore food sold in such restaurants is generally taxable at the normal rate and not the reduced rate. Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 06-98 (Sept. 29, 2006); Virginia Tax Bulletin VTB 05-7 (May 31, 2005); see also Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 18-148 (July 31, 2018) (self-service ‘micro mart' operates like a convenience store and should apply the reduced sales tax rate to prepared foods); Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 16-50 (April 11, 2016) (prepackaged single-serve ice cream and soft serve ice cream sold by an ice cream truck are both predominantly sold for immediate consumption and are subject to the full retail sales tax rate rather than the reduced rate for food). Some vendors are presumed to be sellers of hot food for immediate consumption, and therefore may not impose the reduced tax rates even on sales of foods that would otherwise qualify. Included among these vendors are caterers, concession vendors, entertainment facilities, fair and carnival vendors, gift shops, hamburger stands, ice cream trucks, mobile food vendors, movie theaters, newsstands, and vending machine vendors. Virginia Tax Bulletin VTB 05-7 (May 31, 2005). Meals Sold by Restaurants Retail sales of meals by restaurants, caterers, hotels, motels, and clubs are generally taxable and the reduced tax rate does not apply. Va. Regs. §10-210-930. An employer who sells meals to employees must add the tax to the charge and pay tax on gross sales. Va. Regs. §10-210-930(B). However, if a restaurant or food service operator furnishes meals and drinks to its employees as a part of wages, the meals and drinks are not subject to tax. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-609.3(7); Va. Regs. §10-210-930(C). Free meals provided to customers as a result of poor food quality are also not subject to sales or use tax. Va. Regs. §10-210-930; Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 18-59 (April 25, 2018) (free meals provided to customers for any other purpose are subject to tax); Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 18-60 (April 25, 2018) (same). The Virginia Tax Commissioner ruled that a country club, whose facilities include a restaurant, is not liable for use tax on leftover banquet food it allows its restaurant employees to consume free of charge because the food was already taxed when sold to restaurant patrons. Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 13-235 (Dec. 19, 2013). Items Used to Prepare Meals Virginia imposes sales and use tax on preparation items such as kitchen equipment, tablecloths, silverware, and plates purchased by restaurants, caterers, hotels, motels, and clubs. A purchaser may not purchase these items using a Certificate of Exemption. The Department of Taxation considers the purchase or lease of preparation items to be ineligible for the resale exemption because they are not part of the meal provided, but rather, are items that consumed by the restaurant or caterer.

Further, caterers are presumed to sell food for immediate consumption and may not impose the reduced sales tax rate on their sales of eligible foods.

A dealer engaged in the business of placing vending machines and selling tangible personal property though such machines are responsible for reporting and paying the tax. Dealers not engaged in the business of placing vending machines but who sell tangible personal property through vending machines are responsible for paying the tax. Va. Regs. §10-210-6041; Va. Regs. §10-210-6043; Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 18-148 (July 31, 2018). A seller located in Northern Virginia and the Hampton Roads Regions, where an additional state sales tax of 0.7 percent is imposed, must pay tax on wholesale purchases at a state-tax rate of 6-percent. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-614; Va. Code Ann. §58.1-603.1, as added by 2013 Va. H.B. 2313, effective, July 1, 2013; Va. Code Ann. §58.1-604.01, as added by 2013 Va.

However, any vending machine operators whose machines are under contract to nonprofit organizations are required to only collect and remit sales tax based on the gross receipts from machine sales of items exceeding 10 cents. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-614. When such sales are made in cities or counties that impose local sale tax, the local tax rate of 1-percent must be combined with the applicable state tax rate so that the tax may be computed accordingly. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-614. Dealers that manufacture property sold through vending machines must compute tax at the special rate on the cost of raw material, labor, and overhead. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-614; Va. Regs. §10-210-6041. Effective September 12, 2016, such sales are subject to a combined state and local rate of 6.3 percent (5.3 percent state and 1 percent local) unless the sale is made pursuant to a contract with a nonprofit organization in which case, a seller may deduct sales of $0.10 or less from gross receipts and divide the remaining balance by 1.053 (1.06 in the Hampton Roads and Northern Virginia Regions) to determine the amount of taxable sales upon which the tax is due and payable. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-614; Va. Regs. §10-210-6041; Va. Regs. §10-210-6042. Prior to September 12, 2016, such sales were subject to a combined state and local rate of 6 percent (5 percent state and 1 percent local) unless the sale is made pursuant to a contract with a nonprofit organization in which case, a 5-percent rate is imposed instead of the 6 percent rate. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-614; Va. Regs. §10-210-6041.

Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Other Food-Related Transactions

Depends Virginia exempts from tax purchases and sales of prepared food by certain entities. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-609.1(20), as enacted by 2016 Va. H.B. 1191, effective July 1, 2016; Virginia Tax Bulletin VTB 16-3. Prepared Food and Catering Services Purchased by Exempt Entities Effective April 22, 2016, Virginia allows nonprofit organizations, state and local governmental entities, and churches to use their respective nonprofit exemption certificate, governmental exemption certificate, Form ST-12, or self-issued exemption certificate, Form ST-13A to purchase prepared foods, catering and related services provided in connection with the sale of food exempt from sales and use tax. Virginia Tax Bulletin VTB 16-3. For the exemption to apply, eligible nonprofit entities and state and local governments purchasing food, meals, and associated services for consumption by individuals must satisfy the Department's “use and consumption test.”The Department's use and consumption test is a bright-line test that determines whether a state and local governmental entity or nonprofit organization's purchase of food or other tangible personal property, prepared meals, catering or related services satisfies the statutory “use or consumption” requirement when purchased for consumption by individuals. Virginia Tax Bulletin VTB 16-3. Under this test, nonprofit organizations and state and local governmental entities must demonstrate that:• the provision of the applicable prepared meals, catering or services furthers a function, mission, service or purpose of the governmental or nonprofit entity; • the charge for the food, meals or catering is billed to and paid for by the entity claiming exemption from the tax with payment drawn from the entity's account, rather than using cash or an individual's account; and • the entity claiming the exemption determines to whom, when and how the meals or food are served and consumed. Virginia Tax Bulletin VTB 16-3. Before April 22, 2016, Virginia prohibited nonprofit organizations, governmental entities, and churches using limited self-issued exemption certificates from using their sales and use tax exemption certificates to make exempt purchases of prepared meals, catering and similar taxable services. That was because the limited self-issued exemption certificates applied only to tangible personal property, not to taxable services. Virginia Tax Bulletin VTB 16-3; see also Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 16-64 (April 22, 2016). Food Delivery Facilitation Services Where a company facilitates ordering of food from restaurants online, but never takes possession of the food that is transferred to the customer, that company is providing payment processing services to restaurants and is not a dealer. Therefore, such services are not taxable. Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 17-178 (Oct. 4, 2017). Grocery Personal Shopping Fees Where a grocery store charges a service fee for personal shopping services where customers place their order and pay for their groceries via the Internet or at a curbside location at the grocery store, the service fee is taxable. These charges are for a service provided in connection with sales of tangible personal property, and are, therefore, taxable regardless of whether they are stated separately or included in the price of each individual item. Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 18-102 (May 24, 2018). Self-Service Establishments “Micro markets,” self-service retail establishments selling food and beverages for home and immediate consumption, are treated similar to convenience stores. The operators of these stores should apply the proper tax rates to the food items sold. Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 18-148 (July 31, 2018). BNA-SUTN VA 11.10.
