Nontaxable The California Department of Tax and Fee Administration Effective July 1, 2017, the California State Board of Equalization's (SBOE) jurisdiction over tax administration for sales and use tax was transferred to the Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA). See 2017 Cal. A.B. 102, effective July 1, 2017. For more information, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at California 31.1.1. has taken a broad view of the definition of personal property for sales and use tax purposes. Property can be tangible personal property for sales and use tax purposes even though it is taxed as a real property improvement for real property ad valorem tax purposes. Standard Oil Co. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 42 Cal. Rptr. 543 (Cal. Ct. App. 1965). Tangible personal property does not lose that classification even though the buyer intends to attach the property to the ground. See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1596(a). In addition, buildings, minerals, and other items that are affixed to land are treated as tangible personal property if severance by the seller is required by the contract of sale. See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1596(a). But if such property is to be severed by the buyer, the contract is for the sale of real property. The sale of timber to be severed is taxable as a sale of tangible personal property, regardless of whether the timber is to be severed by the seller or by the purchaser. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1596(b). Fixtures, machinery, or equipment affixed to realty are treated as tangible personal property when the contract provides for removal by either the seller or the purchaser. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1596(c). Leased fixtures that the lessor has the right to remove on breach or termination of a lease are also treated as tangible personal property, unless the lessor of the fixtures is also the lessor of the realty. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6016.3. A contract to sell and install modular systems furniture is a contract for the sale of tangible personal property, not a construction contract. Tax applies to the entire contract price, less the charges excludable pursuant to Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6011 and Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6012. Charges for fabrication labor are subject to tax. For contracts to sell and install modular systems entered into on or after Oct. 1, 1999, retailers may claim a deduction of 10 percent of the total contract price (excluding charges attributable to certain property not attached to panels or realty) as a charge for installation labor, in lieu of separately accounting for the actual installation charges. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1583, effective Dec. 3, 1999. Closely associated with the definition of tangible personal property is the distinction between “materials”and “fixtures” as applied to construction contractors(that are not performing a contract for the U.S. government). Contractors are retailers of fixtures that they furnish and install, but consumers of construction materials. See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1521(b)(2); San Joaquin v. California State Bd. of Equal., 88 Cal. Rptr. 12 (Cal. Ct. App. 1970) (a pump company was held to be a retailer of machinery and equipment with respect to pumps that did not become an integral part of an irrigation system and were not affixed to the land in a permanent fashion, but were instead set in open spaces, usually on timbers, were held in place by gravity, and were often moved from one well to another). Compare San Joaquin v. California State Bd. of Equal., supra, with Seatrain Terminals of California, Inc. v. County of Alameda, 147 Cal. Rptr. 578 (Cal. Ct. App. 1978) (holding that 750-ton cranes mounted on rails with fixed termini in a container facility are fixtures). A used floating home subject to local property taxation is exempt from payment of use tax on resale or transfer as provided in Cal. Rev. &Tax. Code § 6379. For purposes of determining whether property affixed to realty is tangible personal property, prefabricated mobilehomes registered with the Department of Motor Vehicles are not structures. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1660(d)(8). Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6016.5 specifically excludes from the definition of tangible personal property “telephone and telegraph lines, electrical transmission and distribution lines, and the poles, towers, or conduits by which they are supported.” BNA-SUTN CA 28.1.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal General Rule for Classification

Depends In some states, the sale and installation upon real property of complete items of tangible personal property such as kitchen appliances and electronic equipment, sometimes referred to as “fixtures,” is treated as a taxable sale of tangible personal property the same as if these items were sold uninstalled. Among these states, California treats the sale and installation of property classified as either “fixtures” or “machinery and equipment” as the sale of tangible personal property. Construction contractors (other than federal construction contractors) are the retailers of fixtures that they furnish and install in the course of performing construction contracts, and tax applies to the sales price of the fixtures. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(b)(2)(B)(1); see also California Tax Publication 9. Fixtures are defined as items that are accessory to a building or other structure and that do not lose their identity as accessories when installed. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1521(a)(5). Examples of fixtures include air conditioning units; awnings; elevators; furnaces; lighting fixtures; plumbing fixtures;prefabricated cabinets and counters; television antennas; and venetian blinds. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1521, Appendix B; California Tax Publication 9. The classification of property as fixtures by the State Board of Equalization (now the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration) is usually sustained by the courts. See Honeywell, Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 48 Cal. App. 3d 897, 122 Cal. Rptr. 237 (Cal. Ct. App. 1975) (air conditioning control devices); Oliver &Williams Elevator Corp. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 48 Cal. App. 3d 890, 122 Cal. Rptr. 249 (Cal. Ct. App. 1975) (elevators); General Electric Co. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 111 Cal. App. 2d 180, 244 P.2d 427 (Cal. Ct. App. 1952)(521-ton turbine generator). If the contract states the sale price at which the fixture is sold, then tax applies to that price. If not, then the sale price is deemed to be the cost price of the fixture to the contractor. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(b)(2)(B)(2)(a). California provides guidelines to determine fixtures' cost price. The cost price is deemed to be the sale price of a completed fixture to the contractor and includes any manufacturer's excise tax or import duty imposed with respect to the fixture before its sale by the contractor. If the contractor is the manufacturer of the fixture, the cost price is deemed to be the price at which similar fixtures in similar quantities ready for installation are sold by him or her to other contractors. If the contractor is the manufacturer of the fixture, but similar fixtures are not sold to other contractors ready for installation, then the cost price is the amount stated in the price lists, bid sheets or other records of the contractor. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(b)(2)(B)(2)(b). If the sale price cannot be established in the above manner and the fixture is manufactured by the contractor, then California deems the cost price to be the aggregate of:• the cost of materials, including such items as freight-in and import duties; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(b)(2)(B)(2)(b)(1). • direct labor, including fringe benefits and payroll taxes; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(b)(2)(B)(2)(b)(2). • specific factory costs attributable to the fixture; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(b)(2)(B)(2)(b)(3). • any manufacturer's excise tax; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(b)(2)(B)(2)(b)(4). • a pro rata share of all overhead attributable to the manufacture of the fixture; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(b)(2)(B)(2)(b)(5). and • reasonable profit from the manufacturing operations which, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, is deemed to be 5 percent of the sum of the preceding factors. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(b)(2)(B)(2)(b)(6). Jobsite fabrication labor and its prorated share of manufacturing overhead must be included in the sale price of the fixtures. Jobsite fabrication labor includes assembly labor performed before attachment of a component or a fixture to a structure or other real property. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(b)(2)(B)(2)(b). If the construction contractor furnishes and installs a fixture for a person other than the realty's owner, and if the person intends to lease the fixture in place as tangible personal property and pay tax measured by rental receipts, then the construction contractor may take a resale certificate from the lessor at the time of the transaction. The sale to the lessor will be considered to be a sale for resale. The resale certificate should indicate that the fixture is purchased for resale by the purchaser as tangible personal property. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(b)(2)(B)(3). Cabinets A cabinet will be considered “prefabricated and therefore a fixture” when at least 90 percent of the total direct cost of labor and material in fabricating and installing the cabinet is incurred before affixation to the realty. If this is not the case, the component parts of the cabinet will be considered materials and tax will apply to the use of those materials the same as with other construction contracts. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(c)(2); California Tax Publication 9. To determine this 90 percent, compare the total direct costs of all labor and materials in fabricating the cabinet:(1) up to the point of installation, and (2) completely, plus installation. If more than one cabinet is fabricated and installed under the contract, each cabinet is considered separately. California Tax Publication 9. Countertops Countertops are generally regarded as materials, even when prefabricated. However, there are some countertops, primarily countertops that have a sink built in or the sink is installed in the countertop before final installation of the countertop, which are considered fixtures. Regardless of the type of countertop, the 90-percent rule does not apply to contracts to furnish and install a countertop. California Tax Publication 9. Machinery and Equipment In general, construction contractors are retailers of machinery and equipment and tax applies to the gross receipts from those sales furnished and installed by the contractor. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(b)(2)(C)(1); see also California Tax Publication 9. However, if the contract only requires the furnishing and installation of machinery and equipment, tax applies to the total contract price less any charges properly excludible from gross receipts under Cal. Rev. &Tax. Code §6012(c). Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(b)(2)(C)(2)(a); see Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6012(c). “Machinery and equipment” is defined in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1521(a)(6) as: Examples of machinery and equipment include drill presses, electric generators, lathes, machine tools, and printing presses. Not included within the definition of machinery and equipment are wiring and piping used as a source of power or water for machinery and equipment, and tanks over 500-barrel capacity. See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1521, Appendix C; California Tax Publication 9. Prior to July 1, 1985, moving parts of cranes were listed as an example of machinery and equipment. After the court of appeal in a property tax case, Seatrain Terminals, Inc. v. Alameda Cnty., Calif. Seatrain Terminals of Cal., Inc. v. Alameda County, Calif., 147 Cal. Rptr. 578 (Cal. Ct. App. 1978). held that a large gantry crane used to move containers was a taxable improvement to realty, the Board (now the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration) amended Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1521, deleting moving parts of cranes as an example of machinery and equipment and adding moving parts of cranes as an example of fixtures. See also U.S. Lines, Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 227 Cal. Rptr. 347 (Cal. Ct. App. 1986) in which the taxpayer, who constructed and sold two massive container cranes, was treated as the seller of tangible personal property. The Board had argued unsuccessfully that the contract was a construction contract, but the court did not analyze the case as a construction case. If the contract is for a lump sum, and includes the furnishing and installation of materials, fixtures, and machinery and equipment, California has provided the following guidelines to determine the gross receipts of machinery and equipment:• The gross receipts from the sale of the machinery and equipment is the price at which similar quantities ready for installation are sold at retail and delivered in the market area where the installation takes place. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(b)(2)(C)(2)(b). • If there is no such retail price for the machinery and equipment, then the gross receipts amount is calculated from the contract, price lists, bid sheets, or other records of the contractor. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(b)(2)(C)(2)(b). • If, however, the gross receipts cannot be established in the above manner and the machinery and equipment is manufactured by the contractor, the gross receipts from the sale is the aggregate of the following: ○ cost of materials, including such items as freight-in and import duties; ○ direct labor, including fringe benefits and payroll taxes; ○ specific factory costs attributable to the machinery or equipment; ○ any manufacturer's excise tax; ○ pro rata share of all overhead attributable to the machinery or equipment, including overhead attributable to manufacturing, selling, contracting, and administration; and ○ reasonable profit from the manufacture and sale of the machinery or equipment which, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, is deemed to be 5 percent of the sum of the preceding factors. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(b)(2)(C)(2)(b). In addition, jobsite fabrication labor and its prorated share of manufacturing overhead must be included in the sale price of the machinery or equipment. Jobsite fabrication labor includes assembly labor performed before attachment of a component or the machinery or equipment to a structure or other real property. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(b)(2)(C)(2)(b). BNA-SUTN CA 28.2.1.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal Sale and Installation of Signage

Taxable The sale and installation of signage is subject to tax. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(c)(12)(B); California Tax Publication 9. On-premise Electric Signs An on-premise electric sign is a fixture, and tax applies to the sale price of the sign. When furnishing and installing an on-premise electric sign in a contract which does not state the selling price of the sign, tax applies to 33 percent of the “contract price” of the on-premise electric sign that is furnished and installed by the contractor. “Contract price” includes all charges for: materials; fabrication labor;installation labor; overhead; profit; and any other associated charges. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(c)(12)(B); California Tax Publication 9. An on-premise electric sign is any electrically powered or illuminated structure, housing, sign, device, figure, statuary, painting, display, message, placard, or other device or part thereof affixed to real property. These on-premise electric signs must be used to advertise (or to provide advertising data or information)to: (1) designate, identify or indicate the name or business of the premises where the advertising display is located; or (2) advertise the business conducted, services available, or goods produced, or available for sale on the property where the advertising display has been built. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(c)(12)(A); California Tax Publication 9. However, if a contractor installs an on-premise electric sign supplied by a third party, then the installation charges are not taxable. If a seller furnishes, but does not install an on-premise electric sign, then the seller is a retailer of the sign and tax applies to the total contract price for the sale of the sign. California Tax Publication 9. Other Signs Generally, a contract to furnish and install a sign on real property is a construction contract. Large outdoor advertising signs built upon land are considered structures. Contractors who furnish and install these signs are consumers of the materials furnished and installed. Therefore, tax is due on the cost of the materials. Signs attached to buildings are generally considered as fixtures. Because contractors are retailers of the fixtures, tax is due either on the retail selling price or the cost price of the fixtures depending on the type of contract. California Tax Publication 9.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Construction Materials and Contracts Construction Materials and Contracts, Generally

Nontaxable Charges for construction labor billed to a contractee are not subject to sales and use tax in California. California Tax Publication 9. The central problem in applying the sales and use tax law to contractors is to determine at what point a retail sale of tangible personal property occurs. Cal. Rev. and Tax. Code § 6007 defines retail sale as “a sale for any purpose other than resale in the regular course of business in the form of tangible personal property.”Resolution of the problem determines both who is the taxpayer and what is the measure of tax. A related problem is distinguishing between a construction contract and contract for the sale of tangible personal property. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1521 defines a construction contract to include a myriad of activities whereby tangible personal property is transformed into an improvement to realty. See General Electric Co. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 244 P.2d 427, 111 Cal.App.2d 180 (Other 1952). Cal. Code Regs. 1521 limits the definition of a construction contract to exclude a contract for the sale or for the sale and installation of tangible personal property, or the “furnishing of tangible personal property under what is otherwise a construction contract if the person furnishing the property is not responsible under the construction contract for the final affixation or installation of the property furnished.” Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1521(a)(1)(B). The focus is whether, under the contract, the vendor is responsible for final installation of the property furnished. In Western Concrete Structures, Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal., Western Concrete Structures, Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 136 Cal. Rptr. 93 (Cal. Ct. App. 1977); see J. Beck, Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 2006 BL 154423 (Cal. Ct. App. 2006) (cites Western Concrete in its finding that a construction contractor is liable for the payment of either use or sales tax with respect to its consumption of construction materials). the issue was whether the taxpayer was a construction contractor, and therefore a consumer, or a retailer of post tensioning steel tendons used to reinforce concrete. Upon considering all of the facts and circumstances, the court held that the taxpayer was a construction contractor because of the expertise required, the supervision, and the responsibility for errors made by the taxpayer. See Tobi Transport, Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 104 Cal. App. 3d 730, 163 Cal. Rptr. 778 (Cal. Ct. App. 1980) (contract for the sale and for the pumping of concrete into hard-to-reach places was not a construction contract; the taxpayer was not responsible for the final act of affixation of the concrete and smoothing the surface once placed); Overly Mfg. Co. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 191 Cal.App.2d 20, 12 Cal.Rptr. 391 (Cal. Ct. App. 1961) (contract for the sale of door frames and doors was not a construction contract because the taxpayer did not install the frames); San Joaquin, Calif. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 9 Cal.App.3d 365, 88 Cal.Rptr. 12 (Cal. Ct. App. 1970) (pump company that sold and installed deep well agricultural pumps was held not to be a construction contractor furnishing and installing fixtures, but a retailer of machinery and equipment, with respect to the pumps that did not become an integral part of the irrigation system); Greenblatt v. California State Bd. of Equal., 307 P.2d 379, 148 Cal. App. 2d 619 (Cal. Ct. App. 1957) (sellers of precut or prefabricated materials who rendered some assistance to customers in installation were held to be retailers rather than contractors). The sales and use taxation of property transferred to or by contractors depends on a series of definitions set forth in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1521. The key terms employed by Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1521 are “materials,” “fixtures,” “machinery and equipment,” and “supplies and tools.” The definition of “contractor” was broadened to include any person required to be licensed under the California Contractors State License Law and any person contracting with the United States to perform a construction contract, whether organized under the laws of California or another state or country. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1521(a)(B)(2), effective Feb. 13, 1999. California regulations and agency documents provide extensive explanations of many particular applications of the rules for contractors and subcontractors. See California Tax Publication 9. See generally Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(c). Those particular applications deal with draperies and drapery hardware; See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(c)(1). prefabricated cabinets; See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(c)(2). prefabricated buildings; See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(c)(3). factory-built school buildings; See Cal.

Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(c)(12). and solar cells, solar panels; and solar modules. See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(c)(13). Materials “Materials” are defined to include construction material and components, and other tangible personal property that is attached or made a part of real property by contractors in the performance of the contract, so that the material, when combined with other tangible personal property, loses its identity to become an integral part of the real property. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1521(a)(4). Examples of items regarded as materials are asphalt, cement, doors, electrical wiring, linoleum, lumber, paint, and wall-to-wall carpeting (but only when affixed to the floor). See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1521, Appendix A for the complete list of typical items regarded as materials; Santa Clara Sand & Gravel Co. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 37 Cal.Rptr. 506, 225 Cal.App.2d 676 (Cal. Ct. App. 1964) (sand and gravel furnished FOB the job site); Hayward Bldg. Material Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization, 330 P.2d 855, 164 Cal.App.2d 607 (Cal. Ct. App. 1958) (asphalt) (Cal. Ct. App. 1958). Photovoltaic (PV)cell, solar panels, and solar modules are considered materials when they lose their identity and become an integral and inseparable part of the real property. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18 § 1521(13), as amended effective Feb. 3, 2008. In general, construction contractors are regarded as consumers of materials that they install in the performance of construction contracts. See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1521(b)(2)(A)1; California Tax Publication 44. Either sales or use tax applies with respect to the sale or the use of materials by the construction contractors themselves. See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1521(b)(2)(A)1. However, a construction contract may explicitly provide for the transfer of title to the materials from the contractor to the ultimate purchaser before the materials are installed. In that case, if the sales price of the materials is separately stated, the contractor will be deemed to be selling the material. See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1521(b)(2)(A)2. In the case of a time and materials contract, if the contractor bills the customer for “sales tax” computed on a marked up charge for materials, the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration Effective July 1, 2017, the California State Board of Equalization's (SBOE) jurisdiction over tax administration for sales and use tax was transferred to the Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA).

See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1521(b)(2)(A)2. Supplies and Tools Supplies are items of tangible personal property consumed in the performance of a construction contract. See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1521(b)(5). Examples of supplies include oxygen, acetylene, gasoline, acid, thread-cutting oil, and tools and parts for tools when such items are substantially consumed in the performance of a contract. Contractors are consumers of supplies and tools that they use in their business, and tax applies to the sale of such supplies and tools to contractors. See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1521(b)(5); W. Contracting Corp. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 114 Cal. Rptr. 227, 39 Cal. App. 3d 341 (Cal. Ct. App. 1974), which held that former Cal. Rev. &Tax. Code § 6376, exempting a construction contractor having a lump-sum, fixed-price contract from an increase in the sales and use tax rate, did not apply to equipment and supplies, only to fixtures and materials. Restaurant Equipment Contractors Tax applies to restaurant equipment contractors for construction contracts involving the furnishing and installation of materials, fixtures, and machinery and equipment in the same manner as other construction contracts. The BOE (now the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration), in conjunction with the Restaurant Equipment Contractors Association, has made a study of components involved in construction contracts for the furnishing and installation of restaurant equipment. The study provides extensive lists of items that are considered to be materials, machinery and equipment, and fixtures when furnished and installed by construction contractors in performing contracts for the food industry. California Tax Publication 9. Landscape Contractors Landscape contractors that furnish and install plants, trees and lawns are viewed as construction contractors and sales and use tax applies in a similar manner to their services and materials furnished under their contracts. California Tax Publication 9. Plants and trees installed in landscaping contracts are considered fixtures. California Tax Publication 9. Solar Cells, Solar Panels, and Solar Modules Photovoltaic (PV) cells, solar panels, and solar modules (including solar thermal panels and solar electric PV panels)are considered materials if they function in the same manner as other similar materials (e.g., roofing, walls, or windows). Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(c)(13)(A); California Tax Publication 9. Examples include PV integrated skylights; PV panels used as a roof on a parking lot shade structure; PV integrated roofing tiles; wiring; wiring harnesses; strapping; and mounting systems, which include rack framing brackets that are installed on roofs. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(c)(13)(A); California Tax Publication 9. In contrast, PV cells, solar panels, and solar modules (including solar thermal panels and solar electric PV panels)are considered fixtures when they are attached to a building or other structure and do not lose their identity as accessories when installed. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(c)(13)(B); California Tax Publication 9. Examples include rack-mounted solar panels installed on roofs; solar panels used in freestanding solar arrays; terminal boxes; DC and AC disconnect boxes; inverters; transformers; batteries;and pumps. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(c)(13)(B); California Tax Publication 9. A labor charge to attach solar panels purchased in a completed condition to a mounting system is not subject to tax. California Tax Publication 9. When furnishing and installing solar energy systems that include fixtures, construction contractors are required to hold a seller's permit. A construction contractor may furnish and install solar panels that are considered fixtures not materials, for a person, other than the owner of the realty. This person intends to lease the panels in place as tangible personal property and pay tax measured by rental receipts. In this case, the contractor may take a resale certificate from the lessor at the time of the transaction, and the sale to the lessor will be considered a sale for resale.

For a discussion of the sales and use tax treatment of purchases for alternative energy, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at California 30.5. Lumber Products Assessment Beginning Jan. 1, 2013, California requires a 1 percent assessment on purchases of lumber products and engineered wood products in California. This includes lumber products or engineered wood products purchased outside of California but used in the state. Purchasers, including construction contractors, who purchase lumber or engineered wood products for use in California who do not pay the 1 percent assessment to a California retailer are required to report and pay the assessment directly to the state. Cal. Pub. Res. Code §4629.5;California Tax Publication 256. A retailer may retain up to $250 per location as reimbursement for the assessment's startup costs. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18 §2000. Beginning Jan. 1, 2014, retailers required to collect the Lumber Products Assessment may retain an additional$485 per business location as reimbursement for the assessment's startup costs. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §2001; California SBOE Special Notice L-395 (January 2014). Beginning Jan. 1, 2015, California excludes from the definition of “retailer” any retailer with de minimis sales (i.e., less than $25,000) of qualified lumber products and engineered wood products during the previous calendar year. These excluded retailers must notify the purchaser that it must remit the assessment to the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration. Effective July 1, 2017, the California State Board of Equalization's (SBOE) jurisdiction over tax administration for sales and use tax was transferred to the Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA). See 2017 Cal. A.B. 102, effective July 1, 2017. For more information, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at California 31.1.1. Therefore, excluded retailers need not collect the assessment. Cal. Pub. Res. Code §4629.5, as amended by 2014 Cal. A.B. 2031, effective Jan. 1, 2014; California SBOE Special Notice L-395 (Dec. 2014). California does not subject to the assessment lumber products to which labor has added significant value. California SBOE Special Notice L-403 (Dec. 2014). Examples of added-value lumber products include furniture, doors, windows, and decorative products (e.g., paneling, molding, or profiled or patterned baseboards). California SBOE Special Notice L-403 (Dec. 2014). However, many lumber products are nonetheless subject to the assessment even though additional processing occurs. California Tax Publication 256. Additional processing occurs on planed and graded wood or engineered wood products. California Tax Publication 256. District/Local Taxes and Construction Materials California Tax Publication 9 includes information to assist contractors and subcontractors with the application of district tax on the purchase, sale and use of materials, equipment and fixtures. District taxes may be imposed at various rates and more than one district tax may apply to a transaction. California Tax Publication 9. BNA-SUTN CA 28.3.1.

Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(b)(2)(A)(2); California Tax Publication 9. Otherwise, contractors are treated as the consumer of materials (as distinguished from fixtures and machinery and equipment) which they furnish and install in the performance of construction contracts.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Construction Materials and Contracts Separated Construction Contracts, Contractor's Purchases of Materials

Depends The taxability of a contractor's purchase of materials incorporated into real property under a separated construction contract depends on whether the materials are treated as being resold to the contractee. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1521(b)(2)(A); California Tax Publication 9. Contractors are generally considered consumers of and must pay tax on their purchase of materials that they incorporate into real property under lump-sum construction contracts. However, a contractor may purchase materials “ex-tax”under California's resale exemption if:• the contractor bills its customer an amount for “sales tax”computed upon a marked up billing for materials under a time and materials contract; or • the contract (other than a U.S. Government contract) explicitly provides for transfer of title to the materials prior to installation, and the sales price of the materials is separately stated in the contract.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Contracts with Exempt Entities

Depends Federal Government Contractors The power of a state to tax federal contractors has been a fertile source of controversy. The United States Supreme Court has strictly limited application of the federal government's exemption from state tax to transactions of private contractors doing business with the federal government. In United States v. New Mexico, 455 U.S. 720 (U.S. 1982). the Court upheld application of the New Mexico gross receipts and use tax on purchases and other activities of private business entities doing business with the federal government under contract. The contractors performed construction, maintenance, and management services at two federal government laboratories. Title to all tangible personal property purchased by the contractors passed directly from the vendor to the federal government, the risk of loss was on the government, government funds were used to pay the contractors'expenses, and the government had control over disposition of all property purchased under the contracts. Despite the very close relationship of the contractors with the federal government, the substantial autonomy of the contractors over many aspects of their performance led the Court to conclude that the contractors were not instrumentalities of the United States and therefore were not entitled to exemption from state taxes under the supremacy clause. The Court distinguished other cases in which purchases were made in the name of the United States after specific federal government approval and the federal government was liable for the purchase price. Compare Kern-Limerick, Inc. v. Scurlock, 347 U.S. 110 (U.S. 1954), with Aerospace Corp. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 267 Cal. Rptr. 685 (Cal. Ct. App. 1990) (federal government contractor was held not subject to sales tax on overhead materials it purchased because its contracts with the federal government provided that title to property purchased by the contractor for performance of the contract vests in the United States government). In a case with sales tax liability arising in California under a contract similar to the one at issue in United States v. New Mexico, the federal government advanced the contractor the funds to pay the sales tax and then attempted to recover sales tax under a common law cause of action for money had and received. United States v. California, 507 U.S. 746, 113 S. Ct. 1784, 123 L. Ed. 2d 528 (1993). The Supreme Court held that the government's indemnification of a third party's obligations was not tantamount to a tax on the federal government and hence was permissible. The Court rejected the federal common law cause of action for money had and received because the necessary elements were not present. The government's claim based on subrogation was denied because it had acquired only the contractor's rights, and those rights had expired before the government sued. In Washington v. United States, Washington v. United States, 460 U.S. 536, 103 S. Ct. 1344, 75 L. Ed. 2d 264 (1983). the Supreme Court upheld imposition of the Washington state sales and use tax on all purchases of tangible personal property by contractors who used the property to perform construction contracts for the federal government. In re Howell, 731 F.2d 624 (9th Cir. 1984), cert. denied Howell v. California State Bd. of Equal., 469 U.S. 933 (U.S. 1984) (applied Washington v. United States, to a California contractor). In another case, the State Board of Equalization(now the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration) imposed a tax on special test equipment that two defense contractors had either acquired or manufactured and stored on their premises under defense contracts with the United States government. Title passed to the federal government under the terms of the contract as soon as the equipment was ready for use. The Board held test equipment to be taxable when it is used to test end products during and after the manufacturing process, is not built into the end product, and is not itself the end product. The court of appeal held that no tax could be imposed on the contractor because the equipment was purchased for resale to the federal government, and any use after title passed was that of the federal government, not of the contractor. Lockheed Aircraft Corp. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 81 Cal. App. 3d 257, 146 Cal. Rptr. 283 (Cal. Ct. App. 1978). The sale of tangible personal property to a contractor or subcontractor for use in performing contracts with the United States for the construction of improvements to real property in California is a retail sale subject to tax. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6007.5. The tax applies whether the contractor purchases the tangible personal property as the agent of the United States, for its own account and subsequent resale to the United States, or for use in performing contracts for the construction of improvements to real property in California. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6384. With respect to materials and fixtures, United States construction contractors are regarded as consumers of materials and fixtures that they furnish and install in the performance of contracts with the United States government. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1521(b)(1)(A); Fischbach &Moore, Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 172 Cal. Rptr. 923 (Cal. Ct. App. 1981). The sales tax applies even though the contractor purchases the materials and fixtures as an agent of the United States. No tax would apply on the purchase of the materials and fixtures outside California when the contractor purchased the property as an agent of the United States in connection with a construction contract in California. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1521(b)(1). United States contractors are treated as retailers of machinery and equipment furnished in connection with the performance of United States construction contracts and the sale of the equipment to the United States is not subject to tax. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1521(b)(1)(B). Tax also does not apply to the sale of machinery and equipment to United States contractors and subcontractors if title to the property passes to the United States before the contractor uses it. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1521(b)(1)(B); see Honeywell, Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 122 Cal. Rptr. 237 (Cal. Ct. App. 1975). The California Department of Tax and Fee Administration Effective July 1, 2017, the California State Board of Equalization's (SBOE) jurisdiction over tax administration for sales and use tax was transferred to the Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA). See 2017 Cal. A.B. 102, effective July 1, 2017. For more information, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at California 31.1.1. appears to resolve most classification issues in favor of classification as fixtures rather than as machinery and equipment. See Honeywell, Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 122 Cal. Rptr. 237 (Cal. Ct. App. 1975) (upholding a distinction between contractors generally and United States government contractors, at least when the contractor is engaged in the construction of improvements to real property in California); see also C.R. Fedrick, Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 251 Cal. Rptr. 305 (Cal. Ct. App. 1988) (tank settings, pipes, and compressor stations installed at a federal oil reserve are fixtures); Overhead Elec. Co. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 278 Cal. Rptr. 112 (Cal. Ct. App. 1991) (uninterruptible power system installed at a military base is taxable fixture).
