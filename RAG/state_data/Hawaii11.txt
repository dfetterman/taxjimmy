Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Excise and Replacement Taxes

Yes Excise Taxes Hawaii refers to its sales tax as a “general excise tax,” but also imposes several separate excise taxes that function in a manner similar to the state's transactional sales and use tax. See, e.g., Haw. Rev. Stat. §244D-1 et seq. Those taxes include, but are not limited to: • an alcoholic beverage tax; Haw. Rev. Stat. §244D-1 et seq. • a cigarette tax; Haw. Rev. Stat. §245-1 et seq. and • a motor vehicle and aviation fuels tax. Haw. Rev. Stat. §243-1 et seq. Replacement Taxes The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement prohibits member states from imposing a “prohibited replacement tax” which is a tax outside of the sales and use tax that is imposed on products defined in the Agreement. Generally, the Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board will make a finding regarding whether or not a member state has imposed a replacement tax. Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Governing Board, Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement as amended through December 16, 2016, Section 334 and Rule 334 of the Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board,Rules and Procedures.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Historical Information

Est. 1931 Hawaii first enacted a retail sales tax in 1931, which failed soon thereafter and was repealed due to Hawaii's small retail base during the Great Depression. Lowell L. Kalapa, History of the Hawaii GE Tax, Haw. Free Press, September 25, 2011. In its place, Hawaii enacted the general excise tax in 1935 and imposed it on all transactions, including services. This first general excise tax was imposed at a rate of 1.5 percent. During the 1940's, it increased to 2 percent, then reached a rate of 3.5 percent in 1959, just prior to Hawaii's declaration of statehood. It rose to the current rate of 4 percent in 1965 to raise funds to modernize Hawaii. Lowell L. Kalapa, History of the Hawaii GE Tax, Haw. Free Press, September 25, 2011. See also William F. Fox, History and Economic Impact, Univ. of Tennessee, Knoxville,(March 13, 2002). Hawaii's implementation of a “sales and use tax” is actually a general excise and use tax. The general excise tax is a tax on the business making the sale, rather than the consumer purchasing the property or service. In 1969, the legislature adopted the wholesale rate of 0.5 percent for items purchased by manufacturers and producers who would incorporate those items into a good for retail sale. Thirty years later, the wholesale rate was extended to items purchased for resale in services as well. Lowell L. Kalapa, History of the Hawaii GE Tax, Haw. Free Press, September 25, 2011.
