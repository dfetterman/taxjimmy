Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Tangible Personal Property

Destination For state sales and use tax purposes, a sale or purchase of tangible personal property is generally deemed to occur at the place where the property is physically located at the time that the act constituting the sale or purchase takes place. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6010.5; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1628(b)(4). “Sourcing”is the act of determining the tax situs of a transaction. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6026(i). Sales tax is levied on a transfer of title or possession of tangible personal property only if the transfer occurs in California. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6006(a); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6051. Businesses physically located in California making sales to California customers at retail stores, over the internet, by sales representative, over the phone or by mail order are tasked with the responsibility of collecting sales tax on taxable sales of tangible personal property. California Tax Publication 109. The sales tax applies to a sale that occurs in the state regardless of whether the sale follows a movement of the property into this state from a point outside of the state, or precedes a movement of the property from within this state to a point outside the state's borders. Cross-border movement of the property prevents the application of the state's sales tax only when taxation is prohibited by the United States Constitution or a statutory exemption otherwise exists. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620(a)(1). If title to property sold passes to the purchaser at a point outside California, the sales tax does not apply, regardless of the extent to which the retailer participated in the transaction in California. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620(a)(1). The mere fact that title to property is transferred in California at the end of an interstate shipment does not prevent imposition of the sales tax. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620(a)(1); see Meyer v. California State Bd. of Equal., 42 Cal. 2d 376, 267 P.2d 257 (Cal. 1954); Diebold, Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 336 P.2d 650 (Cal. Ct. App. 1959). However, sales tax is not imposed when an order is sent by the purchaser directly to a retailer at a point outside California, or when the order is given to an agent of the retailer in California and the property is shipped to the purchaser under the contract of sale from an out-of-state point directly to the purchaser in California. This exemption applies only if there is no participation whatsoever in the transaction by a local place of business of the retailer or by an agent of the retailer having any connection with the retailer's place of business in California. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620(a)(2)(B); see, e.g. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 53 Cal. App. 4th 289 (Cal. Ct. App. 1997) where the California Court of Appeal held that an oil company did not take “delivery”of a partially completed oil drilling platform despite a mid-construction switch to a new builder, also finding that there was no taxable event for California sales tax purposes. There was no early delivery of the platform, the court explained, holding that the exemption is lost only if the “property is delivered to the purchaser's representative in this state.” Although sales tax does not apply, use tax on the purchaser may be imposed. If the seller maintains a place of business in California, he or she would be liable for collection of the use tax. See California Sales and Use Tax Annotation, 325.0080 Local Participation. When a sale is made pursuant to a security agreement in which the retailer retains title to the property sold as security for payment, the sale occurs when possession of the property is transferred by the retailer to the purchaser or another person at the purchaser's direction. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1628(b)(3)(A). When a sale is “on approval,” the sale does not occur until the purchaser accepts the property sold. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1628(b)(3)(C). For all other sales, unless explicitly agreed that title is to pass at a prior time, the sale occurs at the time and place at which the retailer completes the retailer's performance with reference to the physical delivery of the property, even though a document of title is to be delivered at a different time or place. If the contract requires or authorizes the retailer to send the property to the purchaser but does require the retailer to deliver it at destination, the retailer completes performance with reference to the physical delivery of the property at the time and place of shipment (e.g., delivery of the property to a carrier for delivery by the carrier to the purchaser). However, if the contract expressly requires delivery at destination, including cases where one of the terms of the contract is F.O.B. place of destination, the retailer completes performance with reference to the physical delivery of the property on tender to the purchaser there. When delivery of the property is by facilities of the retailer, title passes and the sale occurs when the property is delivered to the purchaser at the destination unless there is an explicit written agreement executed before the delivery that title is to pass at some other time. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1628(b)(3)(D). Sales tax does not apply to sales of products delivered out-of-state for use outside of California. Retailers are not required to collect tax when:• the product is shipped using the retailer's vehicle directly to the purchaser outside the state; • the product is shipped directly to the purchaser outside the state by common carrier, customs broker, contract carrier, export packer, or forwarding agent; • the product is sold for use in another country and the product is delivered to a scheduled carrier hired by the purchaser or delivered to the purchaser's airplane or ship; or • the sale is of a new, noncommercial vehicle to a foreign resident the vehicle is delivered to a scheduled carrier hired by the purchaser or delivered to the purchaser's airplane or ship.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Local Sourcing

Depends Local sales tax is allocated in a slightly different manner from state sales tax. Local sales tax is determined by the location of the retailer's registered place of business. California Tax Publication 28; California Tax Publication 44. A sale is subject to local sales tax if the retailer's registered place of business in California participates in the sale, and title to the goods passes to the customer in the state. Cal. Rev. & Tax Code §7263; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1822; California Tax Publication 28; see Brisbane, Calif. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 2015 BL 82601 (Cal. Ct. App. 2015) (trial court erred by making no finding as to whether title passed in California when determining whether local sales tax or use tax applied). For retailers with only one place of business in the state, the local sales tax is allocated to the taxing jurisdiction in which that place of business is located, unless the tangible personal property sold is delivered by the retailer or his agent to an out-of-state destination or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. Cal. Rev. & Tax Code §7263; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1822; California Tax Publication 44. If title to the tangible personal property sold passes to the purchaser in California, it is immaterial that title passes to the purchaser outside the local taxing jurisdiction in which the retailer's place of business is located. If a California retailer has multiple places of business within California, then the sales tax is sourced to the business location where the principal negotiation occurred. Cal. Rev. & Tax Code §7263; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1822(a)(2); California Tax Publication 44; Fontana, Cal. v. California Dept. of Tax & Fee Admin., 2017 BL 319875 (Cal. Ct. App., 1st Dist. 2017) (where subsidiary of a company negotiates sale and receives payment for products, sale is properly sourced to location subsidiary's location where negotiation takes place). If an out-of-state retailer does not have a place of business in the state other than a stock of tangible personal property, the place of sale is the location of the stock of property from which delivery or shipment is made. Cal. Rev. & Tax Code §7263; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1822; California Tax Publication 44. When title to property transfers to the California customer outside the state, the transaction is subject to use tax at the place of first use regardless of where the retailer's registered place of business is located. If property is used in a district with a higher tax rate than the rate paid at the time of purchase, use tax is due equal to the difference between the sales tax paid on purchase and the amount that would have been paid if the property had been purchased in the district in which it is being used. California Tax Publication 79B. Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law Local tax allocation is based on whether the transaction is subject to sales or use tax. Sales tax applies if the retailer's in-state place of business participates in the sale and title to the goods passes to the customer within the state. If both conditions are not met, the applicable tax is the use tax. California Tax Publication 28. If the retailer is registered with only one place of business in California, the local sales tax is allocated to the location where the place of business is located, unless the property is delivered by the retailer, their agent, or common carrier for out of state delivery. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7205(a); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1802(a)(1); California Tax Publication 28. If the retailer has more than one place of business in California, but only one place of business participates in the transaction, then the sale is deemed to occur at the place of business that participated in the transaction. See Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7205(a); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1802(a)(2)(A); California Tax Publication 28. When the retailer has more than one place of business in California and multiple places of business participate in the transaction, then the sale is deemed to have occurred at the place where the principal negotiations are carried on. If this place is the place where the order is taken, it is immaterial that the order must be forwarded elsewhere for acceptance, approval of credit, shipment, or billing. In making this determination, an employee's activities are attributed to the place of business where he works. See Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7205(a); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1802(a)(2)(B); California Tax Publication 28. If title to property passes to the purchaser in California, it is immaterial that title passes to the purchaser outside the local taxing jurisdiction of the retailer's principal place of business or that the property was never in the local taxing jurisdiction. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1802(a)(3). For traveling salespeople, in-state sales are attributable to the office to which the salesperson reports. For example, a company that kept its inventory in San Diego, but had an outside sales representative who received support and worked administratively from an office in Fillmore correctly allocated the representative's sales to Fillmore. While the representatives' selling activities occurred in their own homes, on the road, or at customers' offices, the negotiations of key contract terms were attributable to the Fillmore office because that was where the representatives worked out of. California Admin. Hearing No. 626418 (Sept. 23, 2014). Transactions and Use Tax Law (District Taxes) The sourcing of sales under the Transactions and Use Tax Law (District Taxes) is generally the same as the Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law. See California Tax Publication 44; see also California Tax Publication 28; California Tax Publication 177. While most sales subject to local tax are sourced to the retailer's place of business where the sale is negotiated, the district tax is generally distributed to the place of delivery. California Tax Publication 28. If a retailer's only business location is in a district, the retailer will report sales tax for the district, unless the retailer ships or delivers the property out-of-state, out-of-district, or the sale is otherwise exempt from tax. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1821(2); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1822(a)(1); California Tax Publication 44; California Tax Publication 105. Retailers in a district that are selling products that will be delivered outside the district are subject to the state, but not district, rate of tax, unless the retailer engages in business in the district where the products are delivered. A retailer is engaged in business in the district if the retailer: has any kind of permanent or temporary business location in the district; has any kind of representative or agent in the district; uses their own delivery vehicle to deliver items regularly into the district; or receives rental income from the lease of merchandise in the district. California Tax Publication 105; California Tax Publication 44; California Tax Publication 105. If the retailer has more than one location, the place of the sale is considered to be the location that the principal negotiations occurred. If this is the place where the order is taken, it is immaterial that the order must be forwarded elsewhere for acceptance, approval of credit, shipment, or billing. An employee's activities will be attributed to the place of business where he works. Again, property is exempt if the property is shipped to an out-of-state location, an out-of-district location, or is otherwise exempt. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1821(2); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1822(a)(2); California Tax Publication 44; California Tax Publication 105. However, if title to property passes to the purchaser in California, it is immaterial that title passes outside of the taxing jurisdiction (district) where the retailer's place of business is located. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1822(a)(3). Although, the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration Effective July 1, 2017, the California State Board of Equalization's (SBOE) jurisdiction over tax administration for sales and use tax was transferred to the Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA). See 2017 Cal. A.B. 102, effective July 1, 2017. For more information, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at California 31.1.1. has made clear that property delivered outside of a seller's district will not be subject to the seller's district transaction tax. Rather, the property will be subject to district use tax but only if the property is first used in a location that has a district tax. It is presumed that the location of delivery is the location where the property will first be used. In those situations where the property is subject to district use tax, the seller will be required to report the tax if the seller is engaged in business in the district. Otherwise, the purchaser will be required to report the district use tax. California Tax Publication 28; California Tax Publication 44; California Tax Publication 105. An out of state retailer who does not have a place of business in California but maintains a stock of tangible personal property in California will have sales sourced to the location of the stock from where shipment is made. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1822(b)(5); California Tax Publication 44; California Tax Publication 105. However, as discussed above, the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration Effective July 1, 2017, the California State Board of Equalization's (SBOE) jurisdiction over tax administration for sales and use tax was transferred to the Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA). See 2017 Cal. A.B. 102, effective July 1, 2017. For more information, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at California 31.1.1. has stated that delivery of property by the seller outside their district, will not be subject to the seller's district transaction tax, but the sale may be subject to district use tax if the property is first used in a location with a district tax. California Tax Publication 28; California Tax Publication 44; California Tax Publication 105. A retailer will be required to collect district tax when the retailer is engaged in business in a district. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1827(a); California Tax Publication 44; California Tax Publication 28; California Tax Publication 105. A retailer is engaged in business in the district when he maintains, occupies, or uses any type of office, sales room, warehouses, or other place of business in the district even if the use is temporary, indirectly, or through an agent. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1827(c)(1); California Tax Publication 44; California Tax Publication 105. Also, a retailer will be engaged in business in the district if the retailer has a representative operating in the district for the purposes of making sales, deliveries, or to take orders, the retailer derives rentals from a lease of tangible personal property in the district, or the retailer sells or leases vehicles, undocumented vessels, or aircraft that will be registered in the district. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1827(c)(2); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1827(c)(3); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1827(c)(4); California Tax Publication 44; California Tax Publication 28; California Tax Publication 105. Registration Retailers engaged in business in California and making sales of tangible personal property that will be subject to local use tax are required to collect the tax from the purchaser. It is immaterial that the retailer is not engaged in business in the particular county or city where the purchaser uses the property. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1803(c). Retailers who are not engaged in business in the state may apply for a Certificate of Registration—Use Tax. Holders of such certificates are required to collect tax from purchasers, give receipts, and pay tax to the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration Effective July 1, 2017, the California State Board of Equalization's (SBOE) jurisdiction over tax administration for sales and use tax was transferred to the Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA). See 2017 Cal. A.B. 102, effective July 1, 2017. For more information, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at California 31.1.1. in the same manner as retailers engaged in business in the district. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1803(c). Rules for Specific Types of Transactions Out-of-State Retailers Who Maintain a Stock of Tangible Personal Property in California In situations where the retailer does not have a permanent place of business in California other than a stock of tangible personal property or where the retailer has a permanent place of business in the state and stock of tangible personal property, but the sales is negotiated out of the state with no participation by the in-state business location, the place of sale is the location where the shipment is made. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7205(b)(1); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1802(c)(1); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1802(c)(2); California Tax Publication 44. Jet Fuel Sales of jet fuel before Jan. 1, 2008, are sourced to the city, county, or city and county of delivery if the principal negotiations are conducted in California and the retailer has more than one place of business in California. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1802(b)(6)(A)(1); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1802(b)(6)(A)(2); California Tax Publication 28; California Tax Publication 44. Sales subsequent to Jan. 1, 2008 are sourced to the city, county, or city and county that is the point of delivery of the jet fuel to the aircraft. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7205(b)(2); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1802(b)(6)(B); California Tax Publication 28. Airports Multi-jurisdictional airports receive different treatment. A multi-jurisdictional airport is an airport owned or operated by a city, county, or city and county that imposes a local sales tax and the airport is located in a different city, county, or city and city from the local jurisdiction the owns and operates the airport. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7204.03(a)(1); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7204.03(a)(2); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1802(b)(6)(D). In these situations the tax is split between the two local jurisdictions. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7204.03(b)(1); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1802(b)(6)(D)(1); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1802(b)(6)(D)(2); California Tax Publication 44. Auctioneers Sales by auctioneers are sourced to the place where the auction is held. If the auction is held at a location other than the auctioneer's registered place of business, sales totaling$500,000 or more per event are reported directly to the jurisdiction where the auction occurs. If the sales are less than $500,000 per event, the tax is reported to the countywide pool where the auction occurs. California Tax Publication 28; California Tax Publication 44. Internet Auction Sales If a California seller that makes online sales through an internet auction house is engaged in business in a district that imposes a district tax, the seller must report and pay district taxes to that district. However, if a seller is not engaged in business in a district, that seller is not required to report and pay district taxes imposed by that district, but must still report and pay tax at the statewide rate. Purchasers from online auction sales that have property shipped by common carrier to their home district, must pay the district use tax. California Tax Publication 177; California Tax Publication 44. Vending Machines Sales from vending machines are sourced to the location of the vending machine. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1802(b)(6)(B); California Tax Publication 44. Contractors Generally, all of the state sales and use tax statutes and regulations applying to contractors also apply to contractors on the local level. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1806(a); California Tax Publication 44. The jobsite is the place of sale for fixtures or other items installed by the contractor for the purchaser and the place of use for items used by the contractor. Thus, if the jobsite is in a local jurisdiction that has a state-administered local tax, the sales tax applies to the sale of the fixtures, and the use tax applies to the use of materials, unless the items are purchased in a local jurisdiction that has a local tax and the items were not purchased under a resale certificate. If the jobsite is in a local jurisdiction without a state-administered local tax, local sale tax will not apply to the sale of the fixtures even though the contractor's principal place of businesses is in a local jurisdiction with a sales tax. The place of sale of a factory-built school building (relocatable classroom)is the place of business of the retailer regardless of whether the sale includes installation of the building upon a permanent foundation. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1806(b). Use Tax Use tax is imposed on the purchase for storage, use, or other consumption in California of tangible personal property from a retailer. When title transfers to a California customer outside of California, the transaction is subject to use tax. The use tax is generally allocated to the local jurisdiction where the property is put to its first functional use. The ship-to-address is presumed to be the place of use. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1802(d); California Tax Publication 28; California Tax Publication 44. A purchaser is required to report district use tax on the purchase price of tangible personal property if they make the first taxable use of the property in the district, purchased the property without district tax or at a lower rate, or the retailer had no obligation to report the tax. Although, there is a credit for any sales tax paid to another district. California Tax Publication 44. Leases Leases of tangible personal property are considered a use and subject to tax. See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1661(b); California Tax Publication 28; California Tax Publication 44. Leases of mobile transportation equipment negotiated in state are allocated to the lessor's place of business. Leases of mobile transportation equipment negotiated out of state are allocated to the county of use. See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1661(b); California Tax Publication 28; California Tax Publication 44; California Tax Publication 46. Mobile transportation equipment is equipment for use in transporting persons or property for a substantial distance. This includes railroad cars and locomotives, buses, trucks (except one-way rental trucks), truck tractors, truck trailers, dollies, bogies, chassis, reusable cargo shipping containers, aircraft, ships, and tangible personal property that becomes part of mobile transportation equipment. The term does not include items commonly used only in loading or unloading person or property for short distance moving within the confines of a limited area, such as loading docks, warehouses, or terminals. These items would include hand dollies, mine cars, and forklift trucks. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1661(a)(1); see California Tax Publication 28. Specifically, excluded from the definition of mobile transportation equipment are passenger vehicles, trailers and baggage containers designed for hauling by passenger vehicles, and one-way rental trucks. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1661(a)(1)(A); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1661(a)(1)(B); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1661(a)(1)(C); California Tax Publication 46. The lease of other equipment negotiated in or out of state is allocated to the county of use. See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1661(b); California Tax Publication 28. Leases are subject to district tax if the property is used in a district, and the lease payments are taxable under the state use tax law. This general rule applies unless the lease is an exempt fixed price contract that is exempt from district tax. Further, the district tax only applies while the property is used in the district. If the property is moved from the district it is no longer subject to district tax. However, if moved to another location with a district tax, it would be subject to that new location's district tax. Similarly, if the property is first used in a location without a district tax and then moved into a location with a district tax, the property will be subject to the new location's district tax. The burden of reporting the district tax is on the lessor when the lessor is engaged in business in the district. If the lessor is not engaged in business in the district, then the lessee is responsible for reporting the district tax. California Tax Publication 44. The following examples illustrate the how the Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax and District Tax apply in different situations. BNA-SUTN CA 4.1.4.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Credit for Tax Paid to Another Jurisdiction

Yes California allows a reciprocal use tax credit up to, but not exceeding, the amount of any sales or use tax paid to another state before the use, storage, or consumption of the property in California. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6406. In addition to state taxes paid, California allows a taxpayer to take a credit against California state taxes due for local taxes paid as well as taxes paid to the District of Columbia. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6406. The amount of the credit may equal, but not exceed, California use tax liability, including liability arising under the Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 7200 through Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 7212. and the Transactions and Use Tax Law (Transit District Tax). Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 7251 through Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 7274. No credit is allowed for taxes measured by rental payments relating to a period before the taxable use of the property in California. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6406. Where the amount of tax paid in another state is less that the total amount of tax due in the California location where the property is first used, the purchaser owes the difference to be paid as use tax. California Tax Publication 123. BNA-SUTN CA 4.2.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Temporary Presence, In-Transit Property Tangible Personal Property First Used Out-of-state

Certain Exclusions Under certain circumstances, California use tax does not apply to the use in the state of tangible personal property first used outside the state. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620. Use tax does not apply to the use of property purchased for use and used in interstate or foreign commerce prior to its entry into this state, and thereafter used continuously in interstate or foreign commerce both within and without California and not exclusively in California. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620(b)(2)(B)(1). This exclusion from the use tax applies to intermodal cargo containers used to transport freight during a continuous movement from origin shipper to destination receiver by use of two or more of the following modes of transportation: raliroad, vehicle, or vessel, and that is first used in interstate or foreign commerce. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620(b)(2)(B)(2). Members of the Military California exempts from use taxes the storage, use, or other consumption in California of tangible personal property, other than a vehicle, vessel, or aircraft, purchased by a qualified service member before receipt of official orders transferring him or her to the state. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6412. Beginning Jan. 1, 2014, and ending Dec. 31, 2018, members of the military and their families stationed in California are exempt from use tax on purchases made outside the state before the report date on the transfer orders that brought them to live in California. This exemption applies to purchases made out-of-state within 90 days of the transfer date, but does not extend to vehicles, vessels, or aircraft. Purchases made more than 90 days before moving to California are never subject to use tax. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6412, as added by 2013 Cal. A.B. 143, effective Jan. 1, 2014. Hand-Carried from Foreign Country Use tax does not apply to the storage, use, or other consumption in this state of the first $800 of tangible personal property purchased in a foreign country by an individual from a retailer and personally hand-carried into California from the foreign country within any 30-day period. Prior to Jan. 1, 2008, the amount excluded from use tax was the first $400 of tangible personal property purchased in a foreign country. The exclusion does not apply to property sent or shipped into the state. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620(b)(2)(D); California Tax Publication 53A; California Tax Publication 110. Vehicles, Vessels and Aircraft —90-Day Test (Purchased Prior to Oct. 2, 2004, and from July 1, 2007, through Sept. 30, 2008) A vehicle, vessel or aircraft that is purchased outside California is regarded as having been purchased for use in the state if the first functional use of the vehicle, vessel, or aircraft occurs in California. If the first functional use of the vehicle, vessel, or aircraft occurs outside California, but the property is brought into the state within 90 days after its purchase (exclusive of any time of shipment or time of storage for shipment to California), the vehicle, vessel, or aircraft is presumed to have been purchased for use in California. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620(b)(4). The 90-day presumption will not apply, and thus, use tax will not apply, if:• the vehicle, vessel, or aircraft is used, stored, or both used and stored outside of California one-half or more of the time during the six-month period immediately following its entry into this state; • the property is a vehicle, and one-half or more of the miles traveled by the vehicle during the six-month period immediately following its entry into California are commercial miles traveled in interstate or foreign commerce; • the property is a vessel, and one-half or more of the nautical miles traveled by the vessel during the six-month period immediately following its entry into the state are commercial miles traveled in interstate or foreign commerce; and • the property is an aircraft, and one-half or more of the flight time traveled by the aircraft during the six-month period immediately following its entry into the state is commercial flight time traveled in interstate or foreign commerce. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620(b)(4)(A); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620(b)(4)(B). The term “commercial” as used in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620(b)(4) applies to business and not personal use, but is not limited to for-profit businesses. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620(b)(4)(B)(3). Vehicles, Vessels and Aircraft —12-Month Test (Purchased from Oct. 2, 2004, through June 30, 2007, and after Sept. 30, 2008) A vehicle, vessel or aircraft that is purchased outside California is regarded as having been purchased for use in the state if the first functional use of the vehicle, vessel, or aircraft occurs in California. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620(b)(5)(A). If the first functional use of the vehicle, vessel, or aircraft occurs outside California, but the property is brought into the state within 12 months from the date of its purchase, it is rebuttably presumed that the vehicle, vessel, or aircraft was acquired for storage, use, or other consumption in California, and is subject to use tax if any of the following occur:• the vehicle, vessel, or aircraft was purchased by a California resident as defined in section 516 of the Vehicle Code, or by a closely held corporation or limited liability company of which 50 percent or more of the shares or membership interests are held by shareholders or members who are residents of California as defined in section 516 of the Vehicle Code; • in the case of a vehicle, the vehicle was subject to registration under Chapter 1 (commencing with section 4000) of Division 3 of the Vehicle Code during the first 12 months of ownership; • in the case of a vessel or aircraft, that vessel or aircraft was subject to property tax in this state during the first 12 months of ownership;or • the vehicle, vessel, or aircraft is purchased by a nonresident, and is used or stored in this state more than one-half of the time during the first 12 months of ownership. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620(b)(5)(A). The rebuttable presumption may be controverted by documentary evidence that the vehicle, vessel, or aircraft, was purchased for use outside the state during the first 12 months of ownership. Additionally, in the case of a vehicle, the rebuttable presumption may be controverted by documentary evidence showing the vehicle entered California for the exclusive purpose of warranty repair or service, and was used or stored in the state for 30 days or less. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620(b)(5)(B). Vehicles, vessels and aircraft used in interstate of foreign commerce are not subject to California's use tax under the following circumstances:• in the case of a vehicle, use tax will not apply if one-half or more of the miles traveled by the vehicle during the six-month period immediately following its entry into the state are commercial miles traveled in interstate or foreign commerce. • if the property is a vessel, and one-half or more of the nautical miles traveled by the vessel during the six-month period immediately following its entry into the state are commercial miles traveled in interstate or foreign commerce; and • if the property is an aircraft, and one-half or more of the flight time traveled by the aircraft during the six-month period immediately following its entry into the state is commercial flight time traveled in interstate or foreign commerce. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620(b)(5)(C). Such use of property in interstate or foreign commerce as indicated above is acceptable proof of an intent that the property was not purchased for use in California. The term “commercial”applies to business and not personal use, but is not limited to for-profit businesses. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620(b)(5)(C). Repair: Aircraft or vessels, the purchase and use of which are subject to the 12-month test, that enter California exclusively for the purpose of repair, retrofit, or modification, are not deemed to be acquired for storage, use, or other consumption in the state if the repair, retrofit, or modification is: 1) in the case of a vessel, performed by a repair facility that holds an appropriate permit issued by the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration Effective July 1, 2017, the California State Board of Equalization's (SBOE) jurisdiction over tax administration for sales and use tax was transferred to the Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA). See 2017 Cal. A.B. 102, effective July 1, 2017. For more information, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at California 31.1.1. and is licensed to do business by the city, county, or city and county in which it is located if the city, county, or city and county so requires; or 2) in the case of an aircraft, performed by a repair station certified by the Federal Aviation Administration or manufacturer's maintenance facility. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620(b)(5)(D). Locomotives A locomotive that is purchased outside California is regarded as having been purchased for use in the state if the first functional use of the property occurs in California. If the first functional use of the locomotive occurs outside California, but the property is brought into the state within 90 days after its purchase(exclusive of any time of shipment or time of storage for shipment to California), the vehicle, vessel, or aircraft is presumed to have been purchased for use in California, and use tax will apply, unless:• the locomotive is used, stored, or both used and stored in California one-half or more of the time during the six-month period immediately following its entry into this state; or • if one-half or more of the miles traveled by the locomotive during the six-month period immediately following its entry into California are commercial miles traveled in interstate or foreign commerce. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620(b)(6). Such use will be accepted as proof of an intent that the property was not purchased for use in California. The term “commercial”applies to business uses and excludes personal use, but is not limited to for-profit businesses. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620(b)(6).

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Temporary Presence, In-Transit Property Tangible Personal Property Temporarily Stored In-state

Nontaxable Storage of tangible personal property in California for sale in the regular course of business is not subject to use tax. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6008; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6009.1; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620(b)(9). Additionally, the storage or exercise of any right or power over tangible personal property for subsequent use solely outside the state or for the purpose of processing, fabricating, or manufacturing the property into, or attaching it to or incorporating it into, other tangible personal property to be transported outside the state for use solely outside the state is not subject to use tax. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6008; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6009.1; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620(b)(9); California State Bd. of Equal., Storage and Use Exclusion. This exclusion only applies to items subject to use tax and not purchases subject to sales tax. Any use of the items within California other than storage will generally make the item subject to use tax. California State Bd. of Equal., Storage and Use Exclusion. A taxable use is deemed to have occurred in the state if the property has any functional purpose in California other than as an object in transit. Thus, in Parfums-Corday Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal., a manufacturer of perfumes and cosmetics was denied this exemption with respect to display materials stored in a warehouse in Los Angeles and subsequently assembled into promotional prepacks, which were shipped to customers both in and outside California. Even with respect to the display materials ultimately shipped out of California, the court denied the exemption on the grounds that the material served a functional purpose in California by being assembled into items used to increase sales of merchandise to retailers. Thus, the display materials were not simply objects in transit. Parfums-Corday, Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 187 Cal. App. 3d 630, 232 Cal. Rptr. 56 (Cal. Ct. App. 1986).

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Temporary Presence, In-Transit Property Tangible Personal Property Purchased for Use Out-of-state

Depends Sales tax does not apply when pursuant to the contract of sale tangible personal property is required to be shipped and is shipped to a point out-of-state by the retailer, by means of: (1) facilities operated by the retailer; or (2) delivery by the retailer to a carrier, customs broker, or forwarding agent, whether hired by the purchaser or not, for shipment to such out-of-state point. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620(a)(3)(B). In the case of property sold to a purchaser for shipment abroad, tax does not apply if the property is irrevocably committed to the exportation process, which is deemed to occur when the retailer ships or delivers the property in a continuous route or journey to a foreign country by means of:• facilities operated by the retailer; • a carrier, forwarding agent, export packer, customs broker, or other person engaged in the business of preparing property for export, or arranging for its export; or • a ship, airplane, or other conveyance furnished by the purchaser for the purpose of carrying the property in a continuous journey to the foreign country, title to and control of the property passing to the purchaser upon delivery. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620(a)(3)(C)(2); California Tax Publication 32. Otherwise, sales tax applies when the property is delivered to the purchaser or the purchaser's representative in California, whether or not the disclosed or undisclosed intention of the purchaser is to transport the property to a point out-of—state. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620(a)(3)(A); California Tax Publication 53B. Use tax does not apply to the use of a new noncommercial motor vehicle manufactured in the U.S., that is purchased for subsequent delivery to a foreign country and is delivered to such foreign country pursuant to the provisions of Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620(b)(2)(C). Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620(b)(2)(C); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1610(b)(2)(D). Most of the issues in connection with the exclusion from use tax for tangible personal property that will subsequently be used solely outside of California arise from transportation equipment. For example, in American Airlines Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal., the court held that use tax applies to installation of equipment in California even though the equipment was purchased outside the state, tested and held at the taxpayers' facilities in Oklahoma, and scheduled to be substantially consumed in interstate commerce outside California. Am. Airlines, Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 30 Cal. Rptr. 590 (Cal. Ct. App. 1963). Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620(b)(5) was amended, effective Feb. 8, 1986, to reflect the court decision in Stockton Kenworth, Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal., Stockton Kenworth, Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 203 Cal. Rptr. 698 (Cal. Ct. App. 1984) (passive delivery of trucks was not required by Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6009.1). which held that an earlier version of Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620(b)(5) was an improper limitation on the statutory exemption contained at Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6009.1. California's regulation provides several examples to illustrate the meaning of the exclusion. Sales of Vehicles for Use in Out-of-State or Foreign Commerce California does not impose tax on the sale or storage, use, or other consumption of a vehicle delivered into the state by the manufacturer or remanufacturer to a purchaser who is not a California resident and for use exclusively in out-of-state or foreign commerce. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620.1(b)(2)(A); see California Tax Publication 34. For the exemption to apply, the purchaser must:• purchase the vehicle from a dealer located outside California; • remove the vehicle from the state within 30 days after the delivery date; • provide a valid affidavit to the manufacturer, that is accepted in good faith, stating: the name and location of the out-of-state dealer from whom the vehicle was purchased and of the in-state manufacturer that delivered the vehicle; delivery date; that the purchaser is not a California resident and the vehicle is for use exclusively outside the state;that the vehicle was removed from the state and the date of removal;and • provide evidence of out-of-state registration to the manufacturer within 60 days of providing the affidavit to the deliverer. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620.1(b)(2)(A); see California Tax Publication 34. There is a rebuttable presumption that a vehicle registered outside of California and apportioned for use within the state is not for use exclusively outside of California. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620.1(b)(2)(B); see California Tax Publication 34. The sale of a vehicle to a lessor qualifies for the exemption from sales and use tax provided the sale and subsequent use of the vehicle meets the criteria detailed in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620.1(b)(2). Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620.1(d); see California Tax Publication 34. A vehicle purchased out of state and brought into California is regarded as having been purchased for use in this state if the first functional use of the vehicle is in California. When the vehicle enters California but was first functionally used outside of California, the vehicle will nevertheless be presumed to have been purchased for use in this state unless certain criteria are met and documentation can be provided as proof of the intent of out-of-state use. California Tax Publication 34; California Tax Publication 52. On or after Oct. 1, 2008, California law provides a use tax exclusion for vehicles purchased outside California and brought into this state for the exclusive purpose of warranty or repair work for no more than 30 days. The 30-day period includes any travel time to and from the repair facility. California Tax Publication 34. The term vehicle means a new or remanufactured truck, truck tractor, semitrailer, or trailer with an unladen weight of 6,000 pounds or more; or a new or remanufactured trailer coach, or auxiliary dolly, manufactured or remanufactured in this state and purchased from an out-of-state dealer for delivery in this state. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620.1(a)(8). Sales of Trailers for Use in Interstate, Out-of-State or Foreign Commerce California does not impose tax on the sale or storage, use, or other consumption of a trailer delivered into the state by the manufacturer. remanufacturer, or dealer to a purchaser for use exclusively in interstate, out-of-state, or foreign commerce, provided the following criteria are met:• the trailer is manufactured or remanufactured outside California and is removed from this state within 30 days from and after the date of delivery; or the trailer is manufactured or remanufactured within California and is removed from the state within 75 days from and after the date of delivery; • if the trailer is registered outside the state, the purchaser or the purchaser's agent provides the deliverer with a copy of the current out-of-state license and registration for the trailer; • if the trailer is registered in California under the Permanent Trailer Identification (PTI) Program, the purchaser or his agent provides the deliverer with a copy of the federal document assigning or confirming the purchaser's or lessee's USDOT number, FMC number, or a copy of the current SSRS filing with the DMV; and • the purchaser or purchaser's agent provides and affidavit to the manufacturer, remanufacturer, or dealer, that is accepted in good faith, stating:name and location of the dealer from whom the trailer was purchased and of the California manufacturer, remanufacturer, or dealer that delivered the trailer to the purchaser; date of delivery; that the trailer was purchased for use exclusively outside the state, or exclusively in interstate or foreign commerce, or both; that the trailer was removed from the state within the applicable time period (either 30 or 75 days) and the date of removal. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620.1(b)(3)(A). The sale of a trailer to a lessor qualifies for the exemption from sales and use tax provided the sale and subsequent use of the trailer meets the criteria detailed in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620.1(b)(3). Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620.1(d). The term trailer means a new or remanufactured trailer or semi-trailer with an unladen weight of 6,000 pounds or more, manufactured or remanufactured either inside or outside of California. Any vehicle not designed for carrying persons or property on its own structure, such as an auxiliary dolly, does not qualify as a trailer. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1620.1(a)(5). BNA-SUTN CA 4.3.3.
