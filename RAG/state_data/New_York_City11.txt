Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Sales Tax

Yes With a few important exceptions, New York City's sales and use tax applies to all transactions subject to New York State sales and use tax. See N.Y. Tax Law §1210(a); N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2001(a); N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2001(b); N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2001(e). The state of New York authorizes New York City to impose local sales and use taxes in either of two ways. The first, which the city has adopted, is to enact all the taxes, exemptions, and provisions (other than the rate of tax), described in the state sales and use tax statutes, with certain exceptions and differences. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(a)(1); N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2001(a). The second permits cities and counties to enact only a portion of the state sales and use tax statutes. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(b)(1). Accordingly, New York City has enacted the state's tax laws and imposes a sales and use tax. N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2001(a); N.Y. Tax Law §1210(i)(1); see also New York TSB-M-08(9)S (Aug. 28, 2008). Before Aug. 1, 2008, and as authorized by the state of New York, New York City imposed a local sales and use tax, the proceeds of which were remitted to pay off the city's Municipal Assistance Corporation (MAC) bonds. N.Y. Tax Law §1107(a). Accordingly, pursuant to N.Y. Tax Law §1107(a), the City enacted the state's tax laws and imposed the local 4 percent rate until the MAC bonds were paid off in July, 2008. N.Y. Tax Law §1107(d); New York TSB-M-08(9)S (Aug. 28, 2008). When the MAC sales tax expired in July 2008, New York City, as authorized by the state of New York, N.Y. Tax Law §1210(a)(1). resumed its local sales and use tax on Aug. 1, 2008. New York TSB-M-08(9)S (Aug. 28, 2008). Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Mobility Tax (MCTMT) In addition, all sales made in New York City that are subject to the state sales and use tax are also subject to the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Mobility Tax. N.Y. Tax Law §1109(a). The Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District (MCTD) consists of the counties of Dutchess, Nassau, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Suffolk, Westchester, and New York City.

Yes Excise Taxes New York City imposes several excise taxes similar to New York State including, but not limited to, an excise tax on hotel occupancy and a parking surtax. N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2502 (hotel); N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2049 (parking). For more information on New York City's excise taxes, see the Excise Tax Navigator, beginning at New York City 1.1. Replacement Taxes The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement prohibits member states from imposing a “prohibited replacement tax” which is a tax outside of the sales and use tax that is imposed on products defined in the Agreement. Generally, the Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board will make a finding regarding whether or not a member state has imposed a replacement tax. Same as New York State, New York City is not a member of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement and does not impose replacement taxes. Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, State Info.
