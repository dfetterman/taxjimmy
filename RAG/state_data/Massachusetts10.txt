Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Tangible Personal Property

Destination The commonwealth is a destination-based sourcing jurisdiction. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.6.7. Therefore, a sale's situs is deemed to be within Massachusetts, and thus taxable, unless both title to and possession of the property are transferred outside the commonwealth. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.6.7(3)(a)(5). If a contract specifies where title will pass, the title passes as specified according to the contract terms. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.6.7(3)(a)(5)(a). If the sales contract does not state where title will pass, title passes in Massachusetts when the tangible personal property is transferred to an interstate carrier for delivery to the purchaser, and the sale is subject to the commonwealth's sales tax. However, if the tangible personal property is to be delivered to the purchaser by the vendor, title will pass upon completion of the delivery. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.6.7(3)(a)(5)(b). If the delivery is to a purchaser outside of the commonwealth, Massachusetts sales tax does not apply; but if the delivery occurs within the commonwealth, then Massachusetts sales tax does apply. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.6.7(3)(a)(5)(b). Multiple Points of Use Apportionment Business purchasers who purchase and concurrently use prewritten software in more than one jurisdiction must give the seller an exemption certificate claiming multiple points of use (Form ST-12). Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.1.3(15)(a). Upon receipt of the exemption certificate the seller is relieved of any liability to remit the tax. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.1.3(15)(a)(1). Instead, the purchaser must pay the tax directly and apportion the amount, based on a reasonable method, between the different jurisdictions in which the software will be used. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.1.3(15)(a)(5). A Form ST-12 may not be used for software received in person by a business purchaser as a retail store. BNA-SUTN MA 4.1.1.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Services

Destination The commonwealth is a destination-based sourcing jurisdiction. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.6.7. Telecommunications Services Sales of interstate telecommunication services are deemed to occur in Massachusetts if the telecommunication either originates or is received at a location within Massachusetts and the service is charged to a service address in Massachusetts. However, if a particular telecommunication that originates or is received in Massachusetts is charged to neither the service address where the telecommunication originates nor a service address where the telecommunication is received, the telecommunication service is deemed to be sold within Massachusetts if it is paid for in the commonwealth. In general, a telecommunication is paid for in the commonwealth if it is billed to an address within the commonwealth. However, the Commissioner will disregard a billing address that a taxpayer has adopted for the purpose of avoiding tax. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.1.6(4)(a); Massachusetts Letter Ruling 12-6 (May 21, 2012). BNA-SUTN MA 4.1.2.
