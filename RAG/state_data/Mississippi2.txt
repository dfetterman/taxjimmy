Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Tax Collection and Remittance

Depends Individuals, such as corporate officers and shareholders, and individuals with control over or responsibility for fiscal management may be held liable for unpaid sales taxes. Compliance Frequently Asked Questions. An individual may be subject to a tax lien for unpaid sales tax, penalties and interest if that person: • owns 10 percent or more of the total of corporations; • owns 10 percent interest in a limited liability company with 35 or fewer owners; or • exercises responsibility over fiscal management of the business. Miss. Code Ann. §27-65-55(2). Additionally, liability for collection and payment of tax is imposed on a person acting as agent for an out-of-state seller who makes sales in the state, either at auction or as a transient vendor, unless the seller is registered and authorized to collect the tax. Miss. Code Ann. §27-65-55(3). Leased Departments If an established business leases a portion of its shelves, counters, or floor space to another entity selling tangible personal property or performing taxable services, the sales made by the leased department should be reported by the lessor. A lessor not otherwise subject to sales tax collection requirements must obtain a sales tax license on behalf of the lessee. Miss. Reg. § 35.IV.03.03.100, as amended effective Jan. 15, 2019. However, if the lessee conducts business in the leased department in the same manner as a similar, established business and gives evidence to the public of conducting the department separately from the lessor's business, the lessee may apply for a sales tax license and collect and remit sales tax on its own sales, provided separate business records are maintained. In this instance, the lessor is secondarily liable for the tax if the lessee does not fulfill its tax obligations under the license. Miss. Reg. § 35.IV.03.03.101, as amended effective Jan. 15, 2019. Even where the lessor is liable for the sales tax on the lessee's sales, the lessee is still responsible for use tax accrued by its business and must report and remit such use tax to the Department of Revenue. Miss. Reg. § 35.IV.03.03.102, as amended effective Jan. 15, 2019. BNA-SUTN MS 31.3.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Business Owners, Operators

Yes Mississippi sales and use tax becomes a lien on the property of a person selling his business or stock of business. Miss. Code Ann. §27-65-55; Miss. Reg. § 35.I.06.103. The tax should be paid within 10 days after the date the business was sold or quit. The purchaser of the business is required to withhold the amount of the purchase money to cover the taxes, damages and interest due until the seller produces a receipt, which represents that no taxes are due. If the selling owner fails to pay the taxes, damages and interest due, then the successor may be required to use the withheld purchase money to pay the seller's unpaid obligation. Failure of the purchaser to withhold said purchase money makes the buyer personally liable for the payment of taxes, damages, and interest. Miss. Code Ann. §27-65-55. BNA-SUTN MS 31.3.3.

Provided Any taxpayer required to collect and remit sales and use tax is required to file a return and accompanying payment on forms prescribed by the state. Miss. Code Ann. §27-65-31; Miss. Code Ann. §27-67-11(3). Any tax return filed with the state must have its accuracy sworn to by the taxpayer. Miss. Code Ann. §27-65-33(3).

Monthly Mississippi requires taxpayers to file monthly returns if the taxpayer's annual total tax payment exceeds $3,599. Reporting Requirements; Interview with Mississippi Dept. of Revenue(July 30, 2010). Accelerated Payment Provision Typically, monthly returns are filed on the 20th day of the month following the period for which the tax liability accrued. However, Mississippi has enacted an accelerated payment provision for the purpose speeding up collection before June 30th, the close of their fiscal year. Thus taxpayers that owe large sales and use tax liability must file an additional return under Mississippi's accelerated payment provision. If a taxpayer owes more than 50,000 dollars a month, in a preceding year, that taxpayer must file an early return for the month of June. Tax liability is based on at least 75 percent of the taxpayers estimated tax liability for the month of June, or 75 percent of the total tax liability paid in June of the preceding year. This return must be filed by June 25th every year the accelerated provision applies. Miss. Code Ann. §27-65-33; Miss. Code Ann. §27-67-17;Interview with Mississippi Dept. of Revenue (July 30, 2010).
