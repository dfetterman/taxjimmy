Topic: Administration and Procedure Agencies Responsible for Administration Local Sales and Use Tax

Minnesota Department of Revenue The state Commissioner of Revenue collects the local sales and use taxes in Minnesota Minn. Stat. §297A.99(9)(a); see Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 164. This includes special local taxes imposed in Detroit Lakes, Giants Ridge Recreation Area, Mankato, Minneapolis, Proctor, Rochester, St. Cloud, and St. Paul. The Commissioner may collect local taxes with the state sales and use tax. Minn. Stat. §297A.99(9)(a); see Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 164; Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 164M; Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 164S;Minnesota Dept. of Rev., Local Sales and Use Tax Rate Guide. All local taxes are subject to the same penalties, interest, and enforcement provisions that apply to the state sales and use tax. Minn. Stat. §297A.99(9)(a). A request for a refund of state sales and use taxes paid also includes a request for a refund of the political subdivision taxes paid on the goods or services in issue. The Commissioner refunds the full amount of the local sales and use taxes paid on exempt sales or use. Minn. Stat. §297A.99(9)(b). The Commissioner will remit the proceeds of the tax, minus refunds and the locality's proportionate share of the state's cost of collection, to the locality at least quarterly. Minn. Stat. §297A.99(11). The Commissioner deducts the following amounts from the local sales and use tax proceeds prior to distributing the monies:• the direct and indirect costs of the department to administer, audit, and collect the political subdivision's tax; Minn. Stat. §297A.99(11)(1). • the political subdivision's proportionate share of the state's indirect cost of administering all the tax; Minn. Stat. §297A.99(11)(2). and • the cost to the state of constructing and maintaining a zip code or geo-code database necessary for local sales tax collections. Minn. Stat. §297A.99(11)(3).

Topic: Administration and Procedure Vendor/Seller Registration

Required A retailer that is responsible for collecting and remitting sales tax must file an application for a sales tax permit with the Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Revenue. Minn. Stat. §297A.83; see Minnesota Sales and Use Tax Business Guide. Retailers that are responsible for filing an application for a permit include retailers that are located in or maintain a place of business in Minnesota, and out-of-state retailers that make sales to a destination within Minnesota where the retailer engages in the regular and systematic soliciting of potential customers in Minnesota. Minn. R. 8130.2500(1). Additionally, the Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Revenue may require any individual or business that is otherwise obligated to file a use tax return to file a separate application for a sales tax permit. Minn. Stat. §297A.83(c). Any out-of-state retailer that is not obligated to file an application for a sales tax permit may nevertheless voluntarily file an application for a permit. Minn. Stat. §297A.83(b). The sales tax permit is valid until cancelled or revoked, and is valid only for the person in whose name it was granted and for the transaction of business at the places designated on the permit. Minn. Stat. §297A.84. In certain situations, in-state and out-of-state retail vendors may operate within Minnesota through salespersons or other representatives. When this occurs, the Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Revenue is authorized to treat representatives of vendors as agents of the vendor, and as such, require them to register for a sales tax permit as retail vendors where this will assist the Department in the efficient administration of the sales tax. This can include truckers, peddlers, or canvassers as agents of a dealer or distributor. Minn. Stat. §297A.83(3)(b). The Commissioner may cancel a sales tax permit that has been previously issued to a retailer if the Commissioner believes that the tax can be collected more efficiently from the individual or businesses using the property in Minnesota through application of the use tax. Minn. Stat. §297A.83(3)(a). Additionally, the Commissioner may cancel a sales tax permit in one of the following circumstances: Minn. Stat. §297A.85. • the permit holder has not filed a sales or use tax return for at least one year; • the permit holder has not reported any sales or use tax liability on the permit holder's returns for at least two years; • the permit holder requests cancellation of the permit; or • the Commission previously reinstated the permit in a manner that was not in conformance with the applicable rules, provided notice has been given in conformity with the applicable statutory requirements for notification. Minn. Stat. §270C.722(2)(a). The department also publishes a list of revoked sales tax permits, along the amounts owed. See Minnesota Dept. of Rev., Revoked Sales Tax Permits (March 27, 2018). If the Commissioner has revoked a retailer's sales tax permit for whatever reason, before the Commissioner may issue the taxpayer a new permit the taxpayer must apply and provide reasonable evidence of his/her intention to comply with the sales and use tax laws and rules. Minn. Stat. §270C.722(2)(a). The Commissioner may reinstate a revoked sales and use tax permit to a taxpayer that fulfills the following requirements:• the taxpayer must file all unfiled sales and use returns; Minn. R. 8130.2700(5)(A). • the taxpayer must pay with a certified or cashier's check or money order the entire balance of tax, penalty, and interest due; Minn. R. 8130.2700(5)(B). • the taxpayer must deposit with the Commissioner a security or surety bond in an amount equal to three times the average liability for the period for which returns are to be filed, or 6 times the average liability in the case of a taxpayer who has had another permit revoked within the preceding 24 months; Minn. R. 8130.2700(5)(C). • the taxpayer must sign an agreement to file timely returns and remit tax when due in the future; Minn. R. 8130.2700(5)(D). and • the taxpayer must have their sales and use tax returns prepared by an attorney, accountant, agent, or preparer, or the taxpayer must attend a business education class for sales tax given by the Department of Revenue if the taxpayer has had another permit revoked within the preceding twenty-four months. Minn. R. 8130.2700(5)(E). Also, the Commissioner may require the retailer to provide security in an amount reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with the sales and use tax laws. If the Commissioner has revoked a retailer's sales tax permit three times in any 5-year period, the Commissioner may require up to a 24 month waiting period before issuing a new permit. Minn. Stat. §270C.722(2)(b). Markets and Trade Shows In the context of flea markets, craft shows, convention exhibit area exhibitions, etc., the Minnesota Department of Revenue imposes obligations on both the general operator of the event and on the individual businesses that seek to do business at such an event. Minn. Stat. §297A.87. Operators of trade shows and other similar events will be subject to certain obligations if they rent or lease space on the event premises to a seller for a fee, or if they receive a percentage of the seller's sales in order to participate in the trade show. Minn. Stat. §297A.87(1)(b). Operators of trade show or similar events must obtain the following from participating businesses as a prerequisite to participating in the event as a seller:• evidence that the person holds a valid seller's permit; • a written statement that the person is not offering for sale any item that is subject to sales tax; or • a written statement (including the person's name, address, and telephone number) that this is the only selling event that the person will be participating in for that calendar year, that the person will be participating for 3 or fewer days, and that the person will make less than $500 in total sales in the calendar year. Minn. Stat. §297A.87(2)(a). If an individual or business participates in one trade show event per year, where the event lasts no more than three days and the individual or business earns no more than $500 in sales from the event, the sales will qualify as casual or occasional sales and the business will not be required to apply for a sales tax permit in Minnesota. Otherwise, the participating business will be required to apply for a sales tax permit. Minn. Stat. §297A.87(3). Direct Sales Direct sellers are people who make retail sales or take orders for products, often out of their homes. They may sell at sales parties or by appointment in someone else's home. Direct sellers are frequently associated with multi-level marketing companies, and are in business for themselves. They do not make sales as the employee of a company. Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 168. Everyone making taxable retail sales in Minnesota must collect and remit sales tax on those sales. This generally includes individual direct sellers. However, under specified circumstances, company headquarters may remit sales tax for the sales made by their direct sellers. In this case, direct sellers are not obligated to register with the Department of Revenue or to file Minnesota sales and use tax returns. Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 168. In order for the company headquarters to remit sales tax for its direct sellers, the following conditions must be met:• the company headquarters must be registered with the Department for sales and use taxes and assume responsibility for the sales tax due from the direct sellers; • the sales tax remitted must be based on the actual selling price paid by the final purchaser of the items, or on the suggested retail price of the items if the final selling price is not known; • all state and local sales taxes must be collected, reported, and remitted on time; and • direct sellers who prefer to handle their own sales tax must be allowed to do so. Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 168. Direct sellers should contact the Department to determine whether or not the company has a direct selling agreement for sales tax in Minnesota. If a direct seller elects to handle their own sales tax, or the company headquarters has not entered into a direct selling agreement with the Department, then the direct seller must register to collect sales tax. Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 168. BNA-SUTN MN 31.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Tax Collection and Remittance

Vendor Liability for Sales Tax Minnesota requires retail vendors to collect sales tax from all applicable purchases and to remit the tax to the Department of Revenue. Minn. Stat. §297A.77(1). The sales tax charge must be separately stated. Minn. Stat. §297A.77(1). Tax collected by the retailer must be remitted to the Commissioner. Minn. Stat. §297A.77(3); see also Schober v. Minnesota Comr. of Rev., 778 N.W.2d 289 (Minn. 2010). For purposes of the use tax, the retailer must give the purchaser a tax receipt showing that the sales tax has been paid. Minn. Stat. §297A.77(2). If the seller fails to collect the appropriate sales tax due, then the seller is personally liable to pay the tax. Minn. Stat. §289A.31(7)(c). The burden of proof is on the retail seller to show that a sale is not subject to sales tax. Minn. Stat. §297A.665(b). However, a seller will not be held personally liable if the seller does one of the following:• within 90 days from the date of the sale, the seller obtains a fully completed exemption certificate or all of the relevant information required by an exemption certificate; • within 120 days after a request for substantiation by the Commissioner, the seller obtains in good faith a fully completed exemption certificate or all of the relevant information required by an exemption certificate;or • the seller proves by some other means that the transaction was not subject to tax. Minn. Stat. §297A.665(b). The retail vendor will not be relieved of personally liability for sales tax due if the vendor fraudulently fails to collect the tax, or if the vendor solicits purchasers to participate in the unlawful claim of an exemption. Minn. Stat. §297A.665(c). Liability for Use Tax An individual or business that uses, stores, distributes or consumes tangible personal property in Minnesota is liable for use tax. Minn. Stat. §297A.63(1); Minn. R. 8130.3900. A purchaser of tangible personal property that ships the property into Minnesota has the burden of proving that the property was not subject to use tax. Minn. Stat. §297A.665(e). Otherwise, goods brought into Minnesota for the purpose of storage, use, or consumption will be subject to use tax. Minn. R. 8130.4300. The liability for use tax is extinguished when the retailer gives the purchaser a receipt showing that the purchaser has actually paid the sales tax due on the purchased item. Minn. Stat. §297A.78. A nonresident purchaser will not be liable for use tax on items brought into Minnesota where he or she can show that the property was purchased and used for a reasonable period of time outside the state before it was brought in. Minn. R. 8130.4300. Additionally, if an item of tangible personal property has already been subject to use tax in another state in the hands of its current owner, then the use tax due is reduced by the amount of use tax previously paid to another state. Minn. Stat. §297A.80. BNA-SUTN MN 31.3.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Purchaser Liability

Yes A purchaser's liability for use tax is not extinguished until the tax has been paid over to the state. Minn. Stat. §297A.78; Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 156. A receipt showing that sales tax was paid at the time of purchase is sufficient to relieve the purchaser of further liability for use tax on the particular items on the receipt. Minn. Stat. §297A.78; Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 156. If a purchaser has reason to know that a retailer did not have a permit to collect sales tax, a receipt from that retailer will not extinguish use tax liability. Minn. Stat. §297A.78. BNA-SUTN MN 31.3.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Business Owners, Operators

Yes Minnesota imposes personal liability for unpaid sales taxes on certain corporate officers, supervisors, and any other individuals or entities that are in a position of authority or control who are responsible for collecting and remitting sales taxes and who fail to do so. Minn. Stat. §270C.56(1). The liability is imposed on a joint and several basis, meaning that the Department of Revenue can assess the unpaid sales tax against any single individual who is liable, or against a group of liable individuals. Minn. Stat. §270C.56(1); see Elvig v. Minnesota Comr. of Rev., No. 8201-R (Minn. Tax Ct. Mar. 28, 2014) (president of company found personally liable for back-taxes owed by company for which he was the president, chief executive officer, bank account signatory, and sole shareholder); Yik C. Lo v. Commissioner, 2017 BL 119583 (Minn. 2017). Individuals who are found liable have a right of contribution against other liable parties, meaning that a person who has paid all or part of an outstanding amount of sales taxes due may bring a lawsuit to recover from other liable parties the amount they paid beyond their share of the liability. Minn. Stat. §270C.56(4). The Commissioner must assess any individuals that are liable for the unpaid sales tax within the time period covered by the original statute of limitations on the collection of the unpaid sales taxes, or within one year after the date of any order assessing the underlying sales tax, whichever period expires later. Minn. Stat. §270C.56(3). Any individual that is assessed by the Department of Revenue for unpaid sales taxes due to their position as a corporate officer or other responsible party may appeal to the Minnesota Tax Court. Minn. Stat. §270C.56(3). If an unpaid member of a tax-exempt organization's management is serving solely in an honorary capacity, and does not participate in the day to day or financial operations of the organization, and has no actual knowledge of the failure of the business to file returns or remit taxes, then this person will not be considered a liable party for unpaid sales taxes. Minn. Stat. §270C.56(2). However, the Minnesota Tax Court has found individual shareholders liable for delinquent sales taxes. Plunkett v. Minnesota Comr. of Rev. (Minn. Tax Ct. April 2, 1985). In Plunkett v. Minnesota Comr. of Rev., the taxpayer was the officer of a furniture showroom franchisor, and also a majority stockholder in one individual furniture franchise that was found liable for unpaid sales taxes. The taxpayer, in his capacity as a shareholder of the franchise and not as a franchisee or president of the franchise, controlled the payment of all of the bills. The Tax Court found that the liability for unpaid sales taxes extended beyond officers and directors to include majority shareholders who exercise actual control over the affairs of the business. Under these facts, the majority shareholder was therefore liable for unpaid sales taxes. Plunkett (Minn. Tax Ct. April 2, 1985). Successor Liability Often, when a business is sold in its entirety, the issue arises whether the business accrued unpaid sales taxes under the previous business owners. If the business that is being sold owes delinquent sales or use taxes, the state Department of Revenue likely will have filed an enforceable lien for unpaid sales taxes against the business. Later, the new business owner or ‘successor’to the business assets could be liable for these unpaid sales taxes unless the successor complies with certain requirements. Minn. Stat. §270C.57(1)(h); Steel v. Minnesota Comr. of Rev., No. 8647-R (Minn. Tax Ct. Feb. 10, 2015) (successor taxpayer failed to present any evidence to show that he purchased less than half of the business, which would have negated his liability as successor). The business successor has two basic responsibilities, which if completed, will enable the successor to avoid liability for unpaid sales and use taxes. Minn. Stat. §270C.57(2). First, a successor who intends to purchase a business that is subject to an enforceable lien for unpaid sales taxes must notify the Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Revenue of the terms and conditions of the sale of the business at least 20 days prior to taking possession of the business assets or paying the purchase price. Minn. Stat. §270C.57(2)(a). This notification must include the transferring business's tax identification number. Following this notification, the Commissioner of the Department of Revenue will notify the business successor within 20 days of any outstanding sales tax liabilities. Second, the business successor must withhold an amount equal to the unpaid liability from the purchase price that was to be given to the previous business owners and remit that amount to the Commissioner to satisfy the unpaid sales tax liability. Minn. Stat. §270C.57(2)(b). A business successor that complies with these requirements will not be subject to liability for sales taxes that were left unpaid by the previous business owners. Minn. Stat. §270C.57(2)(e). If the business successor fails to complete the first requirement, and does not send the Commissioner notice of the pending sale of the business, then the successor will be liable for any unpaid sales taxes to the extent of the purchase price he or she paid for the business. Minn. Stat. §270C.57(2)(b); Steel v. Minnesota Comr. of Rev., No. 8647-R (Minn. Tax Ct. Feb. 10, 2015). If the business successor successfully notifies the Commissioner of the pending sale, but fails to withhold an amount from the purchase price sufficient to cover the outstanding sales tax liability before paying the purchase price or taking possession of the transferred assets, then the successor will be liable for the amounts included in the lien. Minn. Stat. §270C.57(2)(b). Additionally, if the business successor successfully notifies the Commission of the pending sale, and the Commissioner timely responds that other sales tax liabilities exist in addition to the outstanding sales tax liabilities listed on the lien, such as taxes that are due but not yet filed, and the successor fails to withhold an amount from the purchase price sufficient to cover the outstanding sales tax liabilities as listed on the lien and as described by the Commissioner before the successor pays the purchase price or takes possession of the transferred assets, then the successor will be liable for the amounts listed on the lien and for the other sales tax liabilities that are due but not listed on the lien. Minn. Stat. §270C.57(2)(b). Several additional rules apply, including the following:• the successor will be liable whether the purchase price is paid or the assets are transferred prior to or after notification from the Commissioner; Minn. Stat. §270C.57(2)(b). • the 20 day notice requirement by the successor only applies if: (1) a lien for unpaid sales taxes has been filed by the Department of Revenue prior to the date of the agreement, or (2) if the date of the transfer of the business is more than 30 days after the date of the agreement, and a lien for unpaid sales taxes is filed by the Department of Revenue at least 30 days prior to the date of the transfer; Minn. Stat. §270C.57(2)(a). • if the Commissioner determines, based on the available information, that the business has been sold for an artificially low amount (which could indicate the parties are strategically limiting the extent of the successor's liability by keeping the sales price of the business too low), then the successor will be liable in an amount equal to the total value of the business assets transferred; Minn. Stat. §270C.57(2)(c). • if a business successor becomes liable for the unpaid sales taxes of a business that was transferred by gift, the successor can extinguish his or her liability by returning the gift of the business to the donor; Minn. Stat. §270C.57(2)(d). • if the Commissioner fails to respond to the successor's initial notice within 20 days, the successor will not be liable in any event for any outstanding sales or use taxes other than those listed on the lien; Minn. Stat. §270C.57(2)(e). • the period of time during which the Commissioner may assess the successor for unpaid sales taxes is limited by the original statute of limitations as it applied against the original business owners; Minn. Stat. §270C.57(3). • the Commissioner may abate an assessment if the successor's failure to give notice under this section is due to reasonable cause. Minn. Stat. §270C.57(3). BNA-SUTN MN 31.3.3.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Forms and Returns

Provided Individuals and businesses that are required to collect and remit sales and use tax must file return forms with the taxes when they are paid to the Minnesota Department of Revenue. Minn. Stat. §289A.11; Minn. Stat. §289A.20(4). Any retailer that is required to hold a sales tax permit must file a sales tax return. Minn. Stat. §289A.11(3). Also, a purchaser of items subject to sales tax must file a use tax return if they do not pay the use tax to a retailer that is required to collect the tax. Minn. Stat. §289A.11(3). The returns must be signed by the person filing the return, or by that person's duly authorized agent, when the tax returns are filed. Minn. Stat. §289A.11(3). Sales and use tax returns are filed electronically on the department's website. The following individuals and businesses that make taxable sales or taxable use of tangible personal property in Minnesota, or that hold a current sales and use tax permit, must file a return:• any retailer located in Minnesota; • any retailer maintaining a place of business in Minnesota; • any retailer who has voluntarily filed an application for a permit under Minnesota law, and has been granted one; • any retailer making retail sales from outside Minnesota to a destination within Minnesota if the retailer engages in the regular or systematic soliciting of sales from potential customers in Minnesota; • a purchaser that makes use of items obtained with an exemption certificate for other than the exempt purpose; • any purchaser that is subject to state use tax; or • any person holding a direct pay authorization. Minn. R. 8130.7900(1). For a complete listing and access to sales and use tax forms, see Bloomberg Tax's Sales and Use Tax Rates and Forms. Use Tax Returns Generally, retailers that are required to collect use tax, and purchasers who use, store, or consume tangible personal property in Minnesota without otherwise paying sales or use tax to a retailer that is required to collect the tax, must file use tax returns. Minn. Stat. §289A.11(3). An individual who is not required to hold a sales tax permit and who makes purchases of tangible personal property for personal use may file the use tax return on an annual basis. Minn. Stat. §289A.11(1)(b). Also, where a business is not required to hold a sales tax permit and the business makes annual purchases for use in a trade or business that do not total more than $18,500, the business may file the use tax return on an annual basis. Minn. Stat. §289A.11(1)(b). However, if such a retailer is later required to hold a sales tax permit, or makes purchases for use in a trade or business totaling more than $18,500, then the business must begin to file on a monthly or quarterly basis (whichever is applicable)by filing a use tax return in the month that follows the month in which the retailer applied for a sales tax permit, or made purchases in excess of $18,500. Minn. Stat. §289A.11(1)(b). Consolidated Sales and Use Tax Returns If an individual or business subject to Minnesota sales or use tax has two or more places of business at which the taxpayer engages in transactions subject to tax, the taxpayer may elect to file a consolidated sales and use tax return for all such places of business under certain conditions. Minn. Stat. §289A.11(1); Minn. R. 8130.7500(3). These conditions include:• the taxpayer has been granted a sales and use tax account number by the Minnesota Commissioner of the Department of Revenue; • the taxpayer furnishes to the Commissioner a list containing the business name and addresses and reporting information for each separate place of business; and • the taxpayer makes available at the address used by the taxpayer on the consolidated return the information pertinent to each separate place of business. Minn. R. 8130.7500(3)(A)–(C). Amended Sales and Use Tax Returns The Minnesota Department of Revenue requires individuals and businesses to file amended sales and use tax returns in certain situations. Consolidated filers that amend their returns must use the Minnesota Department of Revenue Web site to complete this filing. Minnesota Dept. of Rev., Sales and Use Tax Forms and Instructions, Amending a Sales and Use Tax Return Taxpayers must file amended return in the following situations:• the taxpayer did not report enough tax on the original return; • the taxpayer reported too much tax on the original return; • the taxpayer charged an incorrect tax rate on an item and will refund the tax to the purchaser; • the taxpayer charged sales tax on an item that the taxpayer shipped directly to another state and refunded the tax to the purchaser; • the taxpayer charged sales tax on nontaxable items and refunded the tax to the purchaser; • the taxpayer received a valid exemption certificate from a customer for a purchase that was made in a prior period and the taxpayer refunded the tax to the purchaser; or • the taxpayer reported sales or purchases in the wrong tax type. Minnesota Dept. of Rev., Sales and Use Tax Forms and Instructions, Amending a Sales and Use Tax Return. If a taxpayer has experienced other situations that need to be rectified with the Minnesota Department of Revenue that are not listed above, the taxpayer should not file an amended return. Instead, the taxpayer should rectify the situation using a separate and different form provided by the Department of Revenue. Minnesota Dept. of Rev., Sales and Use Tax Forms and Instructions, Amending a Sales and Use Tax Return, March 2009; see also Schober v. Minnesota Comr. of Rev., No. A09-717 (Minn. 2010).

Minn. Stat. §270C.39. Annual filing is available to retail taxpayers with an average sales and use tax liability, including local sales and use taxes administered by the Minnesota Department of Revenue, equal to or less than $100 per month during the previous twelve months. In addition, the retailer must have substantially complied with the tax laws in the previous twelve months. Minn. Stat. §289A.18(4)(d); see also Minnesota Basic Sales and Use Tax Manual. The Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Revenue may also grant advanced quarterly or annual filing privileges to a retailer if the Commissioner determines that the retailer's future tax liability will be less than the monthly totals listed above. Minn. Stat. §289A.18(4)(e). Accelerated Filing for Certain Large Taxpayers Taxpayers with large monthly sales tax liabilities will not qualify for quarterly or annual reporting or filing. Therefore, on the monthly filing system, such taxpayers normally remit monthly sales tax that they have collected during the previous reporting period by the 20th day of the following month. As a result of the fact that Minnesota operates on a fiscal year that runs from July through June, the Department of Revenue has implemented certain accelerated filing and paying requirements for large taxpayers only for the month of June to ensure that most of the sales tax collected in June (which normally would have been remitted in July) is remitted to the Department of Revenue before the end of the Minnesota fiscal year. If a taxpayer has an annual sales and use tax liability of $250,000 or more in Minnesota's most recent fiscal year (July through June), the taxpayer must make an accelerated payment of 90 percent of the total estimated amount due for all taxes reported on the taxpayer's June sales and use tax return by June 28th. Minn. Stat. §289A.20(4); see Minnesota Sales and Use Tax Business Guide. For purposes of calculating whether the $250,000 annual sales and use tax liability threshold has been met, taxpayers should not include the 2.5 percent liquor tax, local taxes, and solid waste management taxes. Minnesota Dept. of Rev., Sales Tax Newsletter, No. 69 (revised Feb. 2010). For purposes of calculating the accelerated amount due in June of 90 percent of the total monthly estimated sales and use taxes, taxpayers should include other amount normally reported on the return, including liquor gross receipts sales and use tax, variable rate purchases, motor carrier direct pay purchases, mobile home sales, car rentals, local sales and use taxes and solid waste management taxes. Any remaining amount due for sales taxes collected in June that is not remitted on an accelerated basis is due Aug. 20th. Minnesota Dept. of Rev., Sales Tax Newsletter, No. 69 (revised Feb. 2010). A taxpayer that fails to make all accelerated payments that are due will be subject to tax penalties. Minn. Stat. §289A.60(15). Nil or Zero Returns Taxpayers who have no reportable sales for a filing period are still required to file a return. Minnesota Sales and Use Tax Business Guide. BNA-SUTN MN 31.5.1.

Due with Filing Monthly filers must pay their tax liability with their monthly return, which is due on the 20th of each month. However, vendors having a liability of $250,000 or more during a fiscal year ending June 30th must remit 81.4 percent of their June liability for next year two business days before June 30th and the remaining liability prior to August 20th. Minn. Stat. §289A.20(4); Minnesota Basic Sales and Use Tax Manual. Quarterly and annual filers must pay their tax liability with their returns. Minn. Stat. §289A.20(4); Minnesota Basic Sales and Use Tax Manual. Installment Payments Taxpayers may seek to pay sales and use taxes through an installment payment plan with the Minnesota Department of Revenue. Minnesota Tax Collections Fact Sheet 2. The Department of Revenue does not have specific payment plan guidelines. Instead, each situation is reviewed individually, taking into account various facts and circumstances. Minnesota Tax Collections Fact Sheet 2. Certain conditions, which may be onerous, accompany the convenience of an installment payment plan with the Department of Revenue. These include:• any further tax delinquencies automatically constitute a default of the payment agreement; • any failure to let the Collection Division know that a taxpayer owes additional taxes may result in the use of enforced collection methods to collect taxes due once a default notice is sent; • state tax liens may be filed at any time after the tax bill is sent to the taxpayer; • tax refunds and lottery winnings will automatically be applied to the outstanding liability;however, these will only apply to the outstanding balance on the account. The taxpayer will still be required to make all scheduled payments; • once a taxpayer has requested an installment plan, his or her required sales tax permit may be revoked if the terms of the installment plan are violated. If the sales tax permit is revoked, the permit may not be reinstated until all sales tax liability has been paid in full. Minnesota Tax Collections Fact Sheet 2. BNA-SUTN MN 31.5.2.

Minn. Stat. §289A.50(1)(b). The Commissioner must refund any overpayment of tax that exceeds $1 and if it is less than $1 no refund payment is necessary. Minn. Stat. §289A.50(1)(c). A taxpayer seeking a refund must file the refund within two years after the tax was paid in full, or within three and one half years from the date prescribed for filing the return, whichever period expires later. However, if the taxpayer claiming a refund of taxes paid and the Commissioner have consented to an extension of time for the assessment of tax, then the claim for refund may be filed within the extended period. Minn. R. 8130.8100(2)(B). Refund of Sales Tax to Vendor If a vendor collects tax from a purchaser and remits it to the state on a transaction that is not subject to tax, the tax is refundable to the vendor only if the tax is credited to amounts due to the vendor by the purchaser or returned to the purchaser by the vendor. The claim for refund has to be in writing stating that the tax has been or will be refunded or credited to the purchaser by the vendor. Minn. Stat. §289A.50(2). Refund of Sales Tax to Purchasers When a vendor collects tax from a purchaser on a transaction that is not subject to sales or use tax, the purchaser may apply directly to the Commissioner for a refund if: Minn. Stat. §289A.50(2a)(a). • the purchaser is currently register or was register during the period of the claim, to collect and remit the sales or use tax; Minn. Stat. §289A.50(2a)(a)(1). and • either: Minn. Stat. §289A.50(2a)(a)(2). ○ the amount of the refund to be applied for exceeds $500; Minn. Stat. §289A.50(2a)(a)(2)(i). or ○ the amount of the refund to be applied for does not exceed $500, but the purchaser also applies for a capital equipment claim at the same time, and the total of the two refunds exceeds $500. Minn. Stat. §289A.50(2a)(a)(2)(ii). The purchaser may not file more than two applications for refund in a calendar year. Minn. Stat. §289A.50(2a)(b).

Stat. §289A.50(2c)(a). • the purchaser must provide written notice to the vendor; Minn. Stat. §289A.50(2c)(a)(1). • the notice to the vendor must contain the information necessary to determine the validity of the request; Minn. Stat. §289A.50(2c)(a)(2). and • no cause of action against the vendor accrues until the vendor has had 60 days to respond to the written notice. Minn. Stat. §289A.50(2c)(a)(3). Along with the purchaser's request for a refund from the vendor, a vendor is presumed to have a reasonable business practice regarding the collection of sales and use taxes if the vendor: Minn. Stat. §289A.50(2c). • uses a certified service provider, a certified automated system, or a proprietary system that is certified by the state; Minn. Stat. §289A.50(2c)(b)(1). and • has remitted to the state all taxes collected less any deduction, credits, or collection allowances. Minn. Stat. §289A.50(2c)(b)(2).

Topic: Administration and Procedure Statute of Limitations Assessment of Additional Tax

3.5 Years Under most circumstances, the Department of Revenue may make an assessment of unpaid sales or use taxes for three and a half years following the due date of the return or the date the return was properly filed, whichever is later. Minn. Stat. §289A.38(1). In the case of an erroneous refund, except in cases of fraud or material misrepresentation, the period within which the Department may assess a deficiency arising out of the refund is limited to the two-year period beginning on the date the refund is made. Minn. Stat. §289A.37(2). If part of the refund was induced by fraud or misrepresentation of a material fact, the Department may reassess at any time. Minn. Stat. §289A.37(2). The two-year statute of limitations applicable to erroneous refunds may in certain instances shorten the period during which the Department may make an assessment. If a responsible party understates the total amount of sales tax due on a sales tax return by 25 percent or more, then the Department of Revenue can make an assessment within six and a half years after the due date of the return, or the date the return was filed, whichever is later. Minn. Stat. §289A.38(6). See Topshelf Club v. Commissioner of Revenue, No. 8679, 2017 BL 16824 (Minn. Tax Ct. Jan. 17, 2017) (denying taxpayer request for summary judgment due to expiration of the statute of limitations because if they understated tax by 25 percent or more, the statute of limitations for assessment extends to 6.5 years. Taxpayer also argued that the use of an indirect audit in their case was improper and judge ruled there were issues of material fact as to the validity of its use). A taxpayer has three and one half years from the due date of the return or the date the return was properly filed whichever is later. Minn. Stat. §289A.38(1); Minn. Stat. §289A.38(15). If no return is filed, or if a fraudulent return is filed, then the Department of Revenue may make an assessment at any time. Minn. Stat. §289A.38(5). BNA-SUTN MN 31.11.2.

Stat. §289A.63; see also Minnesota Basic Sales and Use Tax Manual. Penalty for Failure to Pay Sales or Use Tax Minnesota imposes a penalty for failure to pay sales or use tax by the date the taxes are due. During the first 30 days the penalty is 5 percent, with an additional 5 percent penalty during each additional 30 days, not to exceed a total 15 percent penalty in the aggregate. If a taxpayer is required to make electronic payments, but instead pays by check, a 5 percent penalty will be assessed on any payment that was not made electronically. Minn. Stat. §289A.60(1)(e);Minnesota Dept. of Rev., Penalty and Interest for Business Taxes. Penalty for Failure to Properly Complete Sales and Use Tax Returns Minnesota imposes a penalty on a taxpayer that fails to correctly report local sales taxes that are required to be reported on a sales and use tax return, or who fails to report local sales taxes on a separate tax line on the sales and use tax return. The penalty amount is equal to 5 percent of the amount of tax not properly reported on the return. Minn. Stat. §289A.60(25). Also, Minnesota imposes a penalty on a taxpayer that files a consolidated return, and fails to include the required location information. The penalty amount is $500 for each return not containing location information. Minn. Stat. §289A.60(25). Additionally, the commissioner may revoke the taxpayer's authorization to file consolidated sales and use tax returns. Minn. Stat. §289A.60(25). Penalty for Intentional Disregard of Law or Rules If a taxpayer negligently or intentionally disregards the rules and regulations relating to sales and use tax, without any intend to defraud the state, then Minnesota imposes a penalty equal to 10 percent of the sales tax due. Minn. Stat. §289A.60(5). Penalty for Repeated Failures to File or Pay Sales and Use Taxes If a taxpayer establishes a pattern of repeatedly failing to withhold sales or use tax and remit the tax to the Department of Revenue, and the Department of Revenue provides written notice that a penalty will be imposed if such failures continue, and the taxpayer subsequently fails to collect and remit sales tax, a penalty of 25 percent of the outstanding sales tax will be imposed. Minn. Stat. §289A.60(5a). A pattern of repeated failures is defined as failing to remit the sales tax due three times within the previous 25 months. Minn. R. 8175.0100(1)(A). Taxpayers may apply for an abatement of this penalty. Minn. Stat. §289A.60(5a). Penalty for Fraudulently Failing to File or Evade Tax Minnesota imposes a 50 percent penalty on any taxpayer who, with the intent to evade or defeat the collection of the sales tax, fraudulently files a return or fraudulently fails to file a return. Additionally, a 50 percent penalty is imposed on any taxpayer who attempts in any other manner to evade or defeat a tax or payment of tax. Minn. Stat. §289A.60(6)(a). This 50 percent penalty is reduced by any amount actually paid to the Department of Revenue. Minn. Stat. §289A.60(6)(a). In addition to the penalty for fraudulently filing a sales tax return, if the return includes a fraudulent claim for refund, an additional penalty is imposed equal to 50 percent of the refund that is claimed. Minn. Stat. §289A.60(6)(b). Penalty for Use of Sales Tax Exemption Certificate to Evade Tax Minnesota imposes a $100 penalty for each transaction where a person uses an exemption certificate to buy property that will be used for a purpose other than the exemption that is claimed, where the certificate holder intends to evade payment of sales tax to the seller. Minn. Stat. §289A.60(14). Penalty for Underpayment of Accelerated June Sales Tax Liability If a taxpayer is required by Minnesota law to submit an estimate of their June sales tax liability and a 90 percent payment to the Department of Revenue by June 28, and fails to do so, Minnesota imposes a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount by which the taxpayer underpaid their June liabilities. Minn. Stat. §289A.60(15). In other words, the penalty will equal 10 percent of the difference between what the taxpayer's June sales tax liability would have been and what they actually remitted. The penalty will not be imposed if the taxpayer paid the lesser of either 90 percent of the preceding May's sales tax liability or 90 percent of the average monthly liability for the previous calendar year. Minn. Stat. §289A.60(15). Penalty for Sales After Revocation If the Minnesota Department of Revenue revokes a taxpayer's sales tax permit, and the taxpayer continues to make taxable sales, a penalty of $100 is imposed for each day the taxpayer continues to make taxable sales. Minn. Stat. §289A.60(16). Penalty for Operators of Flea Markets and Other Sales Conventions An operator of a flea market or other sales convention (such as a trade show) that fails to comply with the sales and use tax regulations relating to flea markets and trade shows (such as requiring evidence that certain event participants maintain a valid sales tax permit) must pay a $100 penalty each day that the event operator fails to complete these duties. Minn. Stat. §289A.60(17). Tax Delinquency List The Department of Revenue publishes an online list of Minnesota businesses that are delinquent in paying state taxes, including sales taxes, and that, consequently, are prohibited from purchasing liquor, beer, or wine for resale. Distributors are prohibited from selling or delivering such beverages to businesses on the list. The Department removes the business from the list within in two days of its payment of the outstanding taxes. The list is available on the Department's website at www.revenue.state.mn.us/businesses.
