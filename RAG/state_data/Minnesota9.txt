Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Taxation of Property

Taxable The state of Minnesota imposes sales tax upon the gross receipts from retail sales of tangible personal property, and use tax on the “purchase price” of all taxable tangible personal property used, consumed, stored or distributed in Minnesota. Minn. Stat. §297A.62(1); Minn. Stat. §297A.63(1)(a). Tangible personal property means personal property that can be seen, weighed, measured, felt, or touched, or that is in any other manner perceptible to the senses. “Tangible personal property” includes, but is not limited to, electricity, water, gas, steam, and prewritten computer software. Minn. Stat. §297A.61(10)(a). Unless otherwise indicated, Minnesota's sales and use tax provisions apply to specified digital products or other digital products wherever the term “tangible personal property” is used. Minn. Stat. §297A.61(3)(l). See e.g., Minnesota Video Production Industry Guide (sales and rentals of videos are taxable whether they are sold in tangible form, such as tape, CD, DVD, or flash drive, or transferred electronically as a taxable digital product).

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

Depends A mixed transaction includes both taxable and nontaxable goods or services purchased together from the same retailer. Minn. R. 8130.0200(4); Minnesota Revenue Notice 00-04. The sales prices will be the total amount of consideration received by the retailer, unless the nontaxable goods or services are separately stated at the time of the sale and the following apply:• the retailer transfers title or possession of the goods to the purchaser or furnishes or provides access to the services to the purchaser; • the contract, bill, or invoice reflects a reasonable charge for furnishing or providing the nontaxable goods or services; • the purchaser has the option of not buying the nontaxable goods or services while buying the taxable goods or services from the retailer or could have avoided or declined the purchase of nontaxable goods or services;and • the sale of nontaxable goods or services can be segregated from the sale of taxable goods or services. Minnesota Revenue Notice 00-04. In order for the sale of a good or service to be segregated from the sale of another good or service, they have to be distinctly priced, invoiced, warranted and provided independently of each other. Minnesota Revenue Notice 00-04. In a transaction involving both the purchase of a taxable and a nontaxable item where the value of the taxable item is insignificant to the total sales price, a taxable sale has not occurred provided there is no separate charge for the taxable item. Minn. R. 8130.0200(4). BNA-SUTN MN 9.3.1.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Bundled Transactions

Depends A “bundled transaction” is the retail sale of two or more products, not including real property and services to real property, if the products are distinct and identifiable products and sold for one nonitemized price. A bundled transaction does not include the sale of any products in which the sales price varies, or is negotiable, based on the selection by the purchaser of the products included in the transaction. Minn. Stat. §297A.61(38)(a). Distinct and identifiable products do not include:packaging such as containers, boxes, sacks, bags, and bottles or other materials such as wrapping, labels, tags, and instruction guides that accompany the retail sale of the products and are incidental or immaterial to the retail sale. Examples of packaging that are incidental or immaterial include grocery sacks, shoeboxes, dry cleaning garment bags, and express delivery envelopes and boxes. Minn. Stat. §297A.61(38)(b)(1). A product provided free of charge with the required purchase of another product is also not a distinct and identifiable product. A product is provided free of charge if the sales price of the product purchased does not vary depending on the inclusion of the product provided free of charge. Minn. Stat. §297A.61(38)(b)(2). The phrase “one nonitemized price”does not include a price that is separately identified by product on binding sales or other supporting sales-related documentation made available to the customer in paper or electronic form, including an invoice, bill of sale, receipt, contract, service agreement, lease agreement, periodic notice of rates and services, rate card, or price list. Minn. Stat. §297A.61(38)(c). A bundled transaction that contains both taxable and nontaxable items, is considered a retail sale and the entire price is subject to tax unless one element of the bundle is a telecommunications service. Minn. Stat. §297A.61(4)(m). In the case of a bundled transaction that includes telecommunication services, and the seller has maintained books and records identifying the portions of the price that are attributable to the distinct and separately identifiable exempt products, then the products are not considered part of a bundled transaction and may be excluded from the sales price subject to tax. Minn. Stat. §297A.61(4)(m). For the purposes of a bundled transaction including telecommunications services:• books and records maintained by the seller must be maintained in the regular course of business and do not include books and records created and maintained by the seller primarily for tax purposes; • books and records maintained in the regular course of business include but are not limited to financial statements, general ledgers, invoicing and billing systems and reports, and reports for regulatory tariffs and other regulatory matters; and • books and records are maintained primarily for tax purposes when the books and records identify taxable and nontaxable portions of the price, but the seller maintains other books and records that identify different prices attributable to the distinct products included in the same bundled transaction. Minn. Stat. §297A.61(4)(m). Transactions Not Considered Bundled Transactions A transaction that otherwise meets the definition of a bundled transaction as defined in this section is not a bundled transaction if the transaction is described by any one of the following statements:• the retail sale of tangible personal property and a service where the tangible personal property is essential to the use of the service, and is provided exclusively in connection with the service, and the true object of the transaction is the service; Minn. Stat. §297A.61(38)(d)(1). • the retail sale of services where one service is provided that is essential to the use or receipt of a second service and the first service is provided exclusively in connection with the second service and the true object of the transaction is the second service; Minn. Stat. §297A.61(38)(d)(2). • a transaction that includes taxable products and nontaxable products and the purchase price or sales price of the taxable products is de minimis: Minn. Stat. §297A.61(38)(d)(3). ○ de minimis means the seller's purchase price or sales price of the taxable products is 10 percent or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled products. Minn. Stat. §297A.61(38)(e). ○ sellers must use either the purchase price or the sales price of the products to determine if the taxable products are de minimis. Sellers may not use a combination of the purchase price and sales price of the products to determine if the taxable products are de minimis. Minn. Stat. §297A.61(38)(e). ○ sellers must use the full term of a service contract to determine if the taxable products are de minimis. Minn. Stat. §297A.61(38)(e). • the retail sale of exempt tangible personal property and taxable tangible personal property where: Minn. Stat. §297A.61(38)(d)(4). ○ the transaction includes food and food ingredients, drugs, durable medical equipment, mobility-enhancing equipment, over-the-counter drugs, prosthetic devices, or medical supplies; Minn. Stat. §297A.61(38)(d)(4)(i). and ○ if the seller's purchase price or sales price of the taxable tangible personal property is 50 percent or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled tangible personal property. Sellers may not use a combination of the purchase price and sales price of the tangible personal property when making the 50 percent determination for a transaction. Minn. Stat. §297A.61(38)(d)(4)(ii). BNA-SUTN MN 9.3.2.
