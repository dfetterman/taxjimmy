Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Tangible Personal Property

Destination The sourcing rules in Indiana conform to the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-13-1(d); Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-13-1(e). Retail sales, excluding leases and rentals, are sourced according to the following provisions: Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-13-1(d); Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-13-1(e). • if a purchaser receives taxable property or services at a seller's business location, the sale is sourced to that business location; Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-13-1(d)(1); see, e.g., Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20150439 (April 27, 2016) (sourcing to Indiana an Indiana car dealership's sale of a vehicle to an out-of-state purchaser for delivery at the dealership's address); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20140435 (Aug. 26, 2015) (all of displays delivered by an out-of-state taxpayer to its Indiana warehouse were sourced to Indiana absent documentation, such as bills of lading, to support taxpayer's claim that most of displays ultimately were shipped to out-of-state customers). • if a purchaser does not receive taxable property or services at a seller's business location, the sale is sourced to the location where the purchaser receives taxable property or services; Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-13-1(d)(2). •if the location of a sale cannot be determined under the above rules, the sale is sourced to the purchaser's address as indicated by the seller's business records; or Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-13-1(d)(3). • if the location of a sale cannot be sourced under any of the above rules, the sale is sourced to the purchaser's address as obtained during the consummation of the sale, such as the address indicated on the purchaser's payment instrument. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-13-1(d)(4). If the location of a sale cannot be sourced under any of the above rules, the sale is sourced as follows:• if tangible personal property or other taxable property is sold, the sale of such property is sourced to the location from which the property is shipped; • if a digital good or computer software delivered electronically is sold, the sale is sourced to the location from which the digital good or computer software was first available for transmission by the seller, not including any location that merely provided the digital transfer of the product sold; • if a service is sold, the sale is sourced to the location from which the service was provided. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-13-1(d)(5). The Indiana Attorney General provided the following three examples for purposes of illustrating sourcing for sales of tangible personal property:• if a Kentucky resident travels to Indiana and purchases a pair of boots from an Indiana retailer, the sale is sourced to Indiana; • if a Kentucky resident travels to Indiana, purchases a pair of boots, and then asks the Indiana retailer to ship the boots to his residence in Kentucky, the sale is sourced to Indiana; and • if a Kentucky resident calls an Indiana retailer and places an order for a pair of boots and has the boots shipped to his residence in Kentucky, the sale is sourced to Kentucky. Office of the Indiana Attorney General, Official Opinion 2011-8 (Dec. 27, 2011). Sourcing for Software If a taxpayer purchases multiple licenses for taxable software from a vendor for software that is stored on taxpayer's server, sales tax is sourced as for a standard retail sale. Use tax is sourced to Indiana for all of the licenses purchased if the server is located in Indiana. Credit is allowed for tax paid to another state on licenses used outside of Indiana. However, if the server is not located in Indiana, use tax is due on the portion of users in Indiana. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-3-5. Software licenses may be allocated on a global scale, rather than just within the United States. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20170085 (July 26, 2017). However, if the software is purchased from a remote vendor, the taxpayer must pay sales tax, and not use tax, on the software. The temporary storage exemption only applies to use tax and not sales tax. Indiana Memorandum Decision 04-20181733R (April 24, 2019). BNA-SUTN IN 4.1.1.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Services

First Use Indiana sources services to the location where the purchaser made first use of such services. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-13-1. The retail of a service is sourced as follows:• when the service is received by the purchaser at a business location, the sale is sourced to the business location; • when the service is not received by the purchaser at a business location, the sales is sourced to the location where the service was received; • when the service cannot be sourced to a business location or the location of receipt, the sale is sourced to the purchaser's address listed on business records of the seller which are maintained in the ordinary course of business or, if those records are unavailable, to the purchaser's address obtained during the consumption of the sale; or • when the sale cannot be sourced as described above, the sale is sourced to the address where the service was provided. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-13-1. Telecommunication Services and Ancillary Services Sales of telecommunications services are sourced according to the following rules:• Sales of telecommunications services sold on a call-by-call basis are generally sourced to the taxing jurisdiction where the call originates and terminates, if the call originates and terminates in the same jurisdiction, or to the taxing jurisdiction where the service address is located and where the call either originates or terminates. • Sales of telecommunications services sold on a basis other than a call-by-call basis are generally sourced to the customer's place of primary use. • Sales of mobile telecommunications service, other than sales of air-to-ground radiotelephone service or prepaid calling service, are sourced to the customer's place of primary use. • Sales of postpaid calling service are sourced to the location where the signal of the telecommunications service originates, as first identified by the seller's telecommunications system or, if the signal is not transmitted by the seller's telecommunications system, as identified by information that the seller received from the seller's service provider. • Sales of prepaid calling service or prepaid wireless calling service are sourced according to the location determined under the general sourcing rules, except that where the location of prepaid wireless calling service cannot be determined according to the sourcing rules, the sale of the prepaid wireless calling service is sourced either to the location, as determined by the seller, associated with the mobile telephone number for which the service is provided or to the location from which the service is provided. • Sales of ancillary services are sourced to the customer's place of primary use. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-13-1(c)(3); Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-12-14; Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-12-15; Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-12-16. Sales of private communication services are sourced according to the following rules:• Sales of private communication service for a separate charge related to a customer channel termination point are sourced to the location of the customer channel termination point. • Sales of private communication service in which all customer channel termination points are located entirely in one taxing jurisdiction are sourced to the taxing jurisdiction in which the customer channel termination points are located. • If the segments are charged separately, the sale of a private communication service that represents segments of a communications channel between two customer channel termination points that are located in different taxing jurisdictions is sourced to an equal percentage in both such jurisdictions. • If the segments are not charged separately, the sale of a private communication service for segments of a communication channel that is located in more than one taxing jurisdiction is sourced to each such jurisdiction in a percentage determined by dividing the number of customer channel termination points in that jurisdiction by the number of customer channel termination points in all jurisdictions where segments of the communications channel are located. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-12-16(4). BNA-SUTN IN 4.1.2.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Leases and Rentals

Destination Except as provided below for leases and rentals of motor vehicles, trailers, semitrailers, and aircraft, not constituting “transportation equipment,” the first payment on the lease or rental of taxable property is sourced to the location determined under the above general rules. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-13-1(e); Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-13-1(d). Subsequent periodic payments on the lease or rental, if any, are sourced to the property's primary location as indicated by an address that is provided by the lessee and that is available in records that the lessor maintains in the ordinary course of business. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-13-1(e); Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-13-1(d). Motor Vehicles The lease or rental of motor vehicles, trailers, semitrailers, or aircraft that do not qualify as transportation equipment are sourced as follows:• for a lease or rental that requires recurring periodic payments, each periodic payment is sourced to the primary property location. The primary property location is the address for the property provided by the lessee that is available to the lessor from its records maintained in the ordinary course of business, when use of this address does not constitute bad faith. This location may not be altered by intermittent use at different locations; and • for a lease or rental that does not require recurring periodic payments, the payment is sourced the same as a retail sale in accordance with the general sourcing rules above. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-13-1(e); Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-13-1(d). For most periodic leases, tax will be due to the state listed in the contract where the motor vehicle will be licensed. The lessor must provide documentation if that state is not Indiana. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20120395 (July 31, 2013). Transportation Equipment The retail sale, including lease or rental, of transportation equipment is sourced as a retail sale under the above general rules. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-13-1(g); Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-13-1(d). “Transportation equipment”is defined to include the following:• locomotives and railcars that are used to carry persons or property in interstate commerce; • trucks and truck tractors that have a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,001 pounds or greater, trailers, semi-trailers, and passenger buses, if such vehicles are registered under the international registration plan and operated under the authority of a carrier that is authorized by the federal government to carry persons or property in interstate commerce; • aircraft operated by air carriers authorized by the federal government or a foreign authority to carry persons or property in interstate or foreign commerce; and • containers designed for use on any of the transportation equipment described above and component parts attached to such transportation equipment. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-13-1(g)(1); Indiana Letter of Findings 07-0302 (2007). Watercraft The retail sale of watercraft is sourced as a retail sale under the above general rules. Tax does not apply to watercraft sold in interstate commerce. A watercraft is sold in interstate commerce when physically delivered by the selling dealer to a spot outside of the state. The physical delivery may be made by the dealer or a third-party carrier. However, the purchaser may not take physical possession inside the state. The dealer must indicate the terms and method of delivery on the sales invoice and is required to keep a record of the terms of the delivery to substantiate why tax was not collected.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Local Sourcing

No Tax Indiana does not authorize counties or cities to impose a general sales or use tax on any sales or purchases that occur within the locality's borders. Ind. Code Ann. §6-9-34-1; Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-5-43; Ind. Code Ann. §6-9-42-2; Ind. Code Ann. §6-9-42-3; Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-4-4; Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-4-9; Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-4-8. However, local jurisdictions, such as counties and towns, are authorized to impose local option taxes on certain transactions occurring within the jurisdiction of the locality. Ind. Code Ann. §6-9-34-1; Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-5-43; Ind. Code Ann. §6-9-42-2; Ind. Code Ann. §6-9-42-3; Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-4-4; Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-4-9; Ind. Admin.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Credit for Tax Paid to Another Jurisdiction

Yes Indiana provides a credit against the use tax imposed on the use, storage, or consumption of a particular item of tangible personal property equal to the amount, if any, of sales tax, purchase tax, or use tax paid to another state for the acquisition of that property. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-3-5. A purchaser is entitled to a credit for both the state-level and local-level taxes paid to another state for the acquisition of taxable property. Am. United Life Ins. Co. v. Ins. Dept. of State Revenue, No. 49T10-1610-TA-00053, 2017 BL 386238 (Ind. T.C. Oct. 27, 2017). On certain purchases of cargo trailers and recreational vehicles to be registered in another state, Indiana will tax the transaction at the other state's rate. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-2-4(c), as added by 2017 Ind. S.B. 172, effective July 1, 2017 and expiring June 20, 2019. For more information about this provision, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Indiana 29.3.1. Aircraft Previously Registered in Another State Indiana does not impose use tax on aircraft to be registered in the state if such aircraft was previously registered in another state as of Jan. 1, 2017, and sales and use tax was paid to the registration state. There must be no outstanding tax liability related to the aircraft in the registration state, and ownership of the aircraft must not change after Dec. 31, 2016. The application for registration in Indiana must be filed after June 30, 2017, or on or before Sept. 30, 2017, and any registration fees and aircraft excise taxes must be paid. Ind. Code Ann. §6-6-6.5-25, as amended by 2017 Ind. S.B. 515, § 19, effective July 1, 2017. BNA-SUTN IN 4.2.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Temporary Presence, In-Transit Property Tangible Personal Property First Used Out-of-state

Taxable Indiana does not exempt from use tax tangible personal property first used out-of-state. See Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-1-1 et seq. BNA-SUTN IN 4.3.1.

==================================================

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Temporary Presence, In-Transit Property Tangible Personal Property Temporarily Stored In-state

Depends “Temporary storage” is excluded from the definition of “storage”for purposes of the use tax; however, there is not a mirroring exclusion for Indiana's sales tax. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-3-1(b), as amended by 2015 Ind. H.B. 1472, §6, effective Jan. 1, 2016; Indiana Final Order 04-20160602R (March 9, 2017). “Temporary storage”means the keeping or retention of tangible personal property in Indiana for a period of not more than 180 days and only for the purpose of the subsequent use of that property solely outside Indiana. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-3-1(d). Use tax is therefore not imposed on items that are only temporarily stored in Indiana. Sales tax is still due on retail purchases made within Indiana, even if the items will be temporarily stored and then transferred out of state, unless another exemption applies. A taxpayer may not receive a refund of sales tax paid on tangible personal property temporarily stored in state. Indiana Memorandum Decision 04-20181733R (April 24, 2019) (temporary storage exemption is for use tax only); Indiana Final Order 04-20160602R (March 9, 2017). Prior to Jan. 1, 2016, “storage”was defined as the keeping or retention of tangible personal property for any purpose except “the subsequent use of that property solely outside Indiana.” No mention of “temporary storage”was made prior to Jan. 1, 2016. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-3-1(b) (2015); see Zimmer, Inc. v. Indiana Dept. of Rev., 72 N.E.3d 1031, 2017 BL 121635 (Ind. Tax Ct. 2017) (interpreting the phrase “solely outside Indiana”). Aircraft Aircraft are subject to use tax if based in Indiana for 60 days or more. If an aircraft is hangared in Indiana, it creates a presumption that the aircraft is based in Indiana and should have been registered in Indiana, even if it is not actually registered. The owner of the aircraft can rebut the presumption by proving the aircraft was not based in Indiana for 60 days. In the absence of such evidence, use tax will be assessed. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20160453 (Feb. 22, 2017). Sham Transactions The registration or titling of tangible personal property to an out-of-state entity may be found to be a sham transaction if the sole purpose of the entity is to avoid payment of Indiana sales or use tax. In such a case, if the actual purchaser is an Indiana resident and the tangible personal property is used in Indiana, tax will be due. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20160542 (March 9, 2017) (use tax due on purchase of RV by an Indiana resident who titled the RV to a sham LLC in Montana to avoid payment of Indiana sales tax); see also Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20180634 (Oct. 31, 2018) (same facts) BNA-SUTN IN 4.3.2.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Temporary Presence, In-Transit Property Tangible Personal Property Purchased for Use Out-of-state

Taxable Tangible personal property purchased for use out-of-state is not exempt from Indiana's gross retail tax. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-2-1(a); Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-1-2(a); Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-4-1; see also Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20170916 (March 28, 2018) (denying temporary storage exemption for property purchased within Indiana). Cars, motorcycles, and trucks weighing 11,000 pounds or less that will be transported out of state within 30 days of delivery and titled and registered in another state or country are subject to tax at the rate of the destination state or country. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 84. Motor Vehicles All sales of motor vehicles and trailers purchased from a registered Indiana dealer within Indiana are subject to Indiana sales and use tax. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-3-5; Indiana Revenue Ruling 2014-09ST (April 7, 2015). However, if a motor vehicle will be transported and registered outside Indiana within 30 days of delivery, then the dealer must collect tax at the rate imposed by the destination state or country. The dealer will then provide a completed Form ST-108 as proof of the amount of tax that has been paid. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-2-3(b); Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 28S. The purchaser of the motor vehicle is not entitled to a refund of Indiana sales tax paid because the state in which the vehicle is ultimately registered does not provide a credit for the sales tax paid in Indiana. If the sale of a vehicle is completed in Indiana, tax is due regardless of whether or not sales or use tax will also be due in another state. Indiana Final Order 04-20170102R (June 28, 2017); (owing Mississippi use tax on a recreational vehicle purchased in Indiana does not preclude Indiana from imposing sales tax to the transaction); Indiana Final Order 04-20160562R (March 9, 2017) (refund of sales tax denied on purchase of motor vehicle on which Arkansas sales tax was also due); see Indiana Memorandum Decision 04-20170736R (April 26, 2017) (where vehicle was purchased in Indiana but titled and registered in West Virginia within 30 days of sale, partial refund granted of amount of Indiana sales tax paid that exceeded amount of tax due other state; additional refund denied where West Virginia did not allow credit for Indiana tax paid on the vehicle); see also Indiana Final Order 04-20171004R (Feb. 28, 2018) (taxpayer not entitled to a refund of Indiana sales tax paid on a vehicle titled and registered in West Virginia within 30 days of sale because the dealer appropriately charged sales tax at the West Virginia rate). Effective July 1, 2017, cargo trailers and recreational vehicles purchased by a nonresident that will be transported out of Indiana within 30 days of delivery and titled and registered in another state or country are subject to tax at the rate of the destination state or country. Prior to July 1, 2017, cargo trailers and recreational vehicles were taxable at the general rate. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-2-4, as added by 2017 Ind. S.B. 172, effective July 1, 2017; Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 72. An exemption also exists for aircraft purchased by nonresidents for use outside the state. For more information on this fly-away provision, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Indiana 29.1. BNA-SUTN IN 4.3.3.
