Topic: Administration and Procedure Agencies Responsible for Administration Local Sales and Use Tax

Illinois Department of Revenue With certain limited exceptions, Illinois' local retailers' occupation, service occupation, and use taxes are collected and enforced by the Illinois Department of Revenue, which pays the amount of such taxes collected over to the state Treasurer. See 65 ILCS 5/8-11-1; 65 ILCS 5/8-11-5; 55 ILCS 5/5-1006. The state Treasurer is charged with the subsequent distribution of such taxes among the appropriate municipalities, counties, and local authorities. 65 ILCS 5/8-11-1; 65 ILCS 5/8-11-5; 55 ILCS 5/5-1006; 55 ILCS 5/5-1007; 65 ILCS 5/8-11-1.3; 65 ILCS 5/8-11-1.4; 65 ILCS 5/8-11-1.6; 65 ILCS 5/8-11-1.7; 55 ILCS 5/5-1006.5(a), (b); 55 ILCS 5/5-1006.7(a), (b); 70 ILCS 3610/5.01(b), (c); 70 ILCS 1605/30(a), (b); see Illinois General Information Letter ST 17-0002-GIL (Jan. 19, 2017) (stating that generally local sales taxes, including home rule and non-home rule municipal retailers' occupation taxes, county school facilities taxes, and special district taxes, are administered by the Illinois Department of Revenue).

Topic: Administration and Procedure Vendor/Seller Registration

Required Every person who engages in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail or maintains a place of business in Illinois is required to obtain a Certificate of Registration from the Department of Revenue. 35 ILCS 120/2a; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.701(b); Illinois Publication PUB-113. The Certificate should be prominently displayed at the retailer's or service-person's place of business. 35 ILCS 120/2a. Where the department deems it appropriate, it may authorize out-of-state vendors to collect the use tax or service use tax and issue a certificate to that effect. 35 ILCS 105/6; 35 ILCS 115/6. Within 30 days after the taxpayer commences the business of selling tangible personal property at retail, the taxpayer must furnish a bond from a surety. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.701(f)(1); 35 ILCS 120/2a; 35 ILCS 105/12; 35 ILCS 110/12; 35 ILCS 115/12. The surety must be a surety company authorized to do business in Illinois or a bond signed by two personal sureties who have filed sworn statements with the department disclosing net assets of at least three times the amount of the bond required by the taxpayer or a bond secured by an assignment of a bank account or certificate of deposits, stocks or bonds. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.701(f)(1). The amount of security is determined by taking into consideration the amount of money expected to become due from the applicant. The department requires an amount of security that will protect the state of Illinois against failure to pay the tax liability, but the security cannot exceed the lower of three times the amount of the applicant's average monthly tax liability, or $50,000. 35 ILCS 120/2a; 35 ILCS 105/12; 35 ILCS 110/12; 35 ILCS 115/12. To enter into a contract with a state agency, contractors, subcontractors, and any affiliates thereof are required to collect and remit use tax on sales of tangible personal property into the state, even if the affiliate or contractor does not maintain a place of business in Illinois. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 44, §1.5012. The certificate of registration must be conspicuously displayed at the principal place of business where the taxpayer engages in selling tangible personal property at retail. 35 ILCS 120/2a. A certificate of registration for a taxpayer filing monthly tax returns issued or renewed prior to July 1, 2017 is valid for five years from the date of issuance or last renewal. A certificate of registration for a taxpayer filing monthly tax returns issued or renewed on or after July 1, 2017 is valid for one year from the date of issuance or last renewal. Similarly, the expiration date of a sub-certificate of registration is the same date as the related certificate of registration. 35 ILCS 120/2a, as amended by 2017 Ill. H.B. 819, effective Aug. 24, 2017; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 130.701(h), as amended by 43 Ill. Reg. 5069, effective April 17, 2019. Prior to July 1, 2017, a certificate of registration is automatically renewed for an additional five years, unless the department notifies the taxpayer. After July 1, 2017, a certificate of registration is automatically renewed for an additional one year, unless the department notifies the taxpayer. 35 ILCS 120/2a, as amended by 2017 Ill. H.B. 819, effective Aug. 24, 2017; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 130.701(h), as amended by 43 Ill. Reg. 5069, effective April 17, 2019. If a registered taxpayer is delinquent on filing returns, for retailers' occupation tax liability, or any other state or local tax administered or enforced by the department, then the certificate of registration will not be automatically renewed upon its expiration date unless the taxpayer has filed and paid the outstanding tax liability in full. Effective Jan. 1, 2015, the department is required to give a taxpayer, not less than 60 days before the expiration date of the certificate, notice of the amount of tax, penalties, and interest due, and that the certificate of registration will not be automatically renewed. 35 ILCS 120/2a, as amended by 2014 Ill. S.B. 3448, effective Jan. 1, 2015; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.701(i), as amended by 43 Ill. Reg. 5069, effective April 17, 2019. Before Jan. 1, 2015, the department was required to give at least 120 days' notice. 35 ILCS 120/2a (2014). The department may exercise its discretion and approve a renewal of a taxpayer who is delinquent, if the taxpayer files all of the delinquent tax returns or pays the department a percentage of the default liability, as determined by the department and waives all limitations on the collection of the tax liability over a period of five years from the date of renewal. However, no discretionary renewal is allowed if the preceding renewal was conditioned upon an installment agreement. 35 ILCS 120/2a. The department may suspend a certificate of registration if the department finds that the taxpayer knowingly sold contraband cigarettes. 35 ILCS 120/2a. If the registered taxpayer operates other places of business that sell tangible personal property at retail, the taxpayer will be furnished a sub-certificate of registration for each place of business. However, if a taxpayer operates two or more businesses selling tangible personal property at retail in Illinois and the businesses are substantially different in character, circumstances, or trade name, the department may require or permit the taxpayer to apply and obtain a separate certificate of registration for each business. 35 ILCS 120/2a. Cf. Illinois General Information Letter ST 17-0001-GIL (Jan. 10, 2017) (motor vehicle manufacturer that sells vehicles exclusively for resale and that also sells other tangible personal property for which it files and reports tax, is not considered a retailer, and thus, is not subject to the$100 penalty for not filing zero liability transaction reporting returns with respect to the motor vehicle sales for resale). Every prior continuous compliance taxpayer is exempt from the requirement of furnishing security as a condition to being authorized to engage in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail. This exemption continues until the taxpayer is determined to be delinquent in the filing of a return or delinquent in the payment of any state or local tax. To qualify, a taxpayer must have faithfully and continuously compiled with the bond or security condition required for the registration for three consecutive years. 35 ILCS 120/2a. After a liability is admitted by the taxpayer or established by the department through the issuance of a final assessment, the security will be converted after giving the taxpayer at least ten days written notice that payment is due. If upon the conversion the department recognizes an amount in excess of the liability and expenses incurred in converting the security, the remainder must be paid to the taxpayer, with the balance to the state treasury. 35 ILCS 120/2a. Within 30 days after the taxpayer either becomes a prior continuous compliance taxpayer or ceases to collect receipts required to be remitted, files a final tax return, and pays the remaining tax liability, the department is required to discharge any surety and release any security. 35 ILCS 120/2a; 35 ILCS 105/12; 35 ILCS 110/12; 35 ILCS 115/12.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Tax Collection and Remittance

Retailer The person engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail bears the legal incidence of the retailers' occupation tax, rather than the purchaser. 35 ILCS 120/2; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.101(d). If the retailer is required or authorized to collect the use tax, then the purchaser is required pay the tax to retailer. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §150.130(a). With the enactment of the use tax, the retailer became a tax collector. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.101(d). The retailer's failure to collect the tax from the purchaser does not prevent the department from collecting the tax directly from the purchaser, whether the retailer's obligation to remit is from the retailers' occupation tax or the use tax. In the event that the purchaser buys the tangible personal property at retail, but does not pay the use tax to the retailer, the purchaser shall pay the use tax directly to the department. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §150.130(a). Any use tax collected by the retailer must be remitted to the department. Since the use tax is complementary to the retailers' occupation tax, the retailer may first reduce the amount of use tax he is obligated to remit by the amount of retailers' occupation tax that he paid to the department with respect to the sale. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §150.130(b). Thus, the purchaser offsets retailer's retailers' occupation tax liability. The service occupation tax is to be paid to the department by any serviceman who transfers tangible personal property as an incident to a sale of a service. If a serviceman collects an amount to be reimbursed for the service occupation tax in excess of the service occupation tax liability, the purchaser will have a legal right to claim a refund from the serviceman. If the amount is not refunded to the purchaser, the serviceman or supplier is liable to pay that amount to the department. 35 ILCS 115/3-40. The service use tax is collected on behalf of the department by a serviceman who incurs and remits a service occupation tax, maintains a place of business in Illinois, and has service use tax collection obligation, or a serviceman who is authorized to voluntarily collect the service use tax, is required to collect the tax from users. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §160.115(a). In a bulk sale, if the purchaser fails to file the notice of sale within the prescribed time then the purchaser will be personally liable for the amount of tax owed by the seller up to the reasonable value of the property acquired by the purchaser. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.1701(a)(4). The seller must pay the department the amount of tax, penalty and interest that is due up to the date of the payment of tax. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.1701(a)(4). If trustees, receivers, executors or administrators liquidate the assets of a business, they become liable for the retailers'occupation tax so long as the liquidation takes place by means of sales for use or consumption and consists of tangible personal property customarily sold by the business. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.105. Marketplace Facilitators Beginning Jan. 1, 2020, a marketplace facilitator that meets either of the following criteria for a 12-month period is considered a retailer, and is required to collect and remit sales tax for a period of at least one year:• marketplace facilitator and marketplace sellers have cumulative gross receipts from sales of tangible personal property in Illinois of at least $100,000;or • marketplace facilitator and marketplace sellers cumulatively enter into 200 or more separate transactions for the sale of tangible personal property to Illinois purchasers. 35 ILCS 105/2d(b), as added by 2019 Ill. S.B. 689, effective June 5, 2019. The marketplace facilitator must make a determination at the end of each quarter whether or not it meets either the gross receipts or the number of thresholds criteria for the preceding 12 months. Those who meet one of the criteria are considered the retailer of each sale made through its marketplace and are responsible for collecting and remitting sales tax, as well as other requirements and procedures imposed on Illinois retailers. At the end of such one-year period, the facilitator will again determine whether it meets the tax collection criteria for the preceding 12 months. 35 ILCS 105/2d, as added by 2019 Ill. S.B. 689, effective June 5, 2019. The marketplace seller must provide the information necessary for the marketplace facilitator to correctly collect and remit taxes for a retail sale. If the seller provides such information and the marketplace facilitator fails to correctly collect and remit tax, the seller will be held harmless as to liability for the tax. However, if the marketplace facilitator demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the department, that its failure to properly collect and remit tax was due to its good faith reliance on the marketplace seller, the facilitator will be relieved of liability for the tax on that specific transaction. 35 ILCS 105/2d(f) and (g), as added by 2019 Ill. S.B. 689, effective June 5, 2019. Taxes at Fairs, Festivals, Flea Markets and Craft Shows Every person, including nonprofit service organizations as well as other persons, engaging in the sale of any tangible personal property for use or consumption as a concessionaire at the Illinois State Fair, County Fairs, art shows, flea markets and the like, are required to collect and remit sales tax to the department. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2045(a). All Illinois retailers, residents or not, must register with the department for each tax to be collected. If the retailer travels routinely, such retailer must register as a “changing location” filer. Out-of-state vendors and Illinois vendors that are not required to register with the department must collect and remit sales tax by completing Illinois Form IDOR-6-SETR. If necessary, the department may collect sales tax daily at the end of an event in order to ensure that the tax due is collected from out-of-state or transient merchants. Illinois Dept. of Rev., Taxes at Fairs, Festivals, Flea Markets, and Craft Shows. Tax on Sale of Motor Vehicles, Watercraft, Aircraft and Trailers With respect to motor vehicles, watercraft, aircraft, and trailers that are required to be registered with any Illinois agency, every retailer selling this kind of tangible personal property is required to file a separate return and remit payment for each item sold, unless multiple items are sold in a single transaction or a transfer of such item is made from one retailer to another for the purpose of resale. 35 ILCS 120/3; see Illinois General Information Letter ST 17-0001-GIL (Jan. 10, 2017) (manufacturer selling its motor vehicles exclusively for resale is not considered a retailer and is not required to file “zero returns”for those nontaxable sales for resale). Agency Agreements Illinois permits manufacturers, importers, and wholesalers to enter into an agency agreement where they register, file returns, and remit retailers' occupation tax on behalf of local distributors. The tax is based on the sales price to the end user, including local taxes, and not the sale to the distributor. Distributors operating under such an agreement do not need to register, file returns, or remit taxes; however distributors may choose to opt out of such an agreement. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.550; Illinois General Information Letter ST 18-0023-GIL (Sept. 13, 2018). BNA-SUTN IL 31.3.1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Purchaser Liability

Depends The person engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail bears the legal incidence of the retailers' occupation tax, however the purchaser may be liable if the tax was not collected. 35 ILCS 120/2; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.101(d). The retailer's failure to collect the tax from the purchaser does not prevent the department from collecting the tax directly from the purchaser, whether the retailer's obligation to remit is from the retailers' occupation tax or the use tax. In the event that the purchaser buys the tangible personal property at retail, but does not pay the use tax to the retailer, the purchaser shall pay the use tax directly to the department. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §150.130(a). If the retailer is required or authorized to collect the use tax, then the purchaser is required pay the tax to retailer. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §150.130(a). In a bulk sale, if the purchaser fails to file the notice of sale within the prescribed time then the purchaser will be personally liable for the amount of tax owed by the seller up to the reasonable value of the property acquired by the purchaser. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.1701(a). BNA-SUTN IL 31.3.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Business Owners, Operators

Yes Any officer or employee of a corporation may be personally responsible for the company's retailers' occupation tax if the individual has control, supervision, or responsibility for filing returns and paying taxes and the individual willfully failed to do so. 35 ILCS 735/3-7; Illinois Administrative Hearing ST 13-19 (Oct. 7, 2013); Illinois Administrative Hearing ST 14-02 (Jan. 8, 2014) . An officer may rebut the presumption that she had significant control over the company's finances by presenting sufficient evidence to show that the control was not present. Absent that evidence, it is presumed that the officer is a responsible party. Illinois Administrative Hearing ST 14-29 (Nov. 14, 2014); Illinois Administrative Hearing ST 15-10 (Aug. 12, 2015) (taxpayer did not present any evidence showing that he did not have control over the business affairs of the company when he was the sole owner; he also made no effort to determine whether the unpaid tax liability had been paid, making his conduct “willful” so that he was personally liable for the unpaid sales tax obligation). A taxpayer that leaves one business to start another may be relieved of liability for unpaid taxes when there is credible evidence demonstrating that the taxpayer started another business and no longer acted with any duty or authority for the prior business at the time a tax penalty is assessed. See Illinois Administrative Hearing ST 15-09 (Aug. 17, 2015) (taxpayer had been a responsible officer of the business before penalties had been assessed for unpaid taxes, but the taxpayer presented evidence that he had left the business to start another business before the delinquency occurred; therefore, he could not be personally liable for the delinquent taxes and penalties because he was no longer a responsible corporate officer). Delegating the management of a business to another individual does not relieve a party from liability if the party retains the power to supervise and control the management of the business. Illinois Administrative Hearing ST 15-16 (Oct. 29, 2015) (taxpayer who allowed his father to make decisions for the business was not absolved of liability because liability isn't limited to the “most responsible”person; taxpayer was the president of the business and had acted in that role by signing returns and checks at certain times, even if not all the time); Illinois Administrative Hearing ST 15-07 (Aug. 6, 2015) (taxpayer was a responsible officer even when another person had been contracted to manage the business; taxpayer still retained the power to supervise the business and simply did not do so during the time at issue).

Topic: Administration and Procedure Due Date Filing

20the of the Month The frequency with which a taxpayer must file a return depends on the average monthly tax liability over the preceding four complete calendar quarters. 35 ILCS 120/3, amended by 2015 Ill. S.B. 2884, effective Jan. 27, 2017; see Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.501(a). Beginning Jan. 1, 2018, if the taxpayer's average monthly retailers' occupation tax, use tax, service occupation tax, and service use tax liability is $20,000 or more during the preceding four complete calendar quarters, a return must be filed each month by 20 days following the month. 35 ILCS 120/3, amended by 2015 Ill. S.B. 2884, effective Jan. 27, 2017; see Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.501(a), as amended by 43 Ill. Reg. 5069, effective April 17, 2019 (requirement does not include returns for motor vehicles, watercraft, aircraft, and trailers required to be registered with a state agency). The $20,000 threshold excludes any liability for prepaid sales tax. 35 ILCS 120/3, amended by 2015 Ill. S.B. 2884, effective Jan. 27, 2017. If the due date for a return or payment falls on a weekend or holiday, the return with the payment is due the next business day. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.1205; see also Illinois Publication PUB-113; Illinois Informational Bulletin FY 1998-3 (Nov. 1997). If the retailer's average monthly tax liability does not exceed $200, the department may allow returns to be filed on a quarterly basis. The return is due twenty days after the end each quarter. Thus, quarterly returns are due by April 20 of the current year, July 20 of the current year, Oct. 20 of the current year, and Jan. 20 of the following year. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.502(a). If the average monthly tax liability does not exceed $50, the department may authorize returns to be filed annually. The department's decision to allow annual filing is based upon information, such as registration and audit information, obtained by the department. The annual return is due by Jan. 20 of the following year. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.510(a). BNA-SUTN IL 31.5.1.

Required for Certain Taxpayers A taxpayer who has an annual tax liability of $20,000 or more shall make all payments of that tax to the Illinois Department of Revenue by electronic funds transfer except that any other payments that accompany a tax return (e.g., ST-1-X return payments or 556 return payments) may not be paid by electronic funds transfer. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §750.300; Illinois Publication PUB-113. The term “annual tax liability” shall be the sum of the taxpayer's liability reported on that taxpayer's Form ST-1, Sales and Use Tax and E911 Surcharge Return. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 750.300(b)(1)(E)-(F). The department will only require payments by electronic funds transfer in those circumstances in which it is cost-effective for the department to receive payments by electronic funds transfer and where receipt of payments by electronic funds transfer is consistent with the department's tax processing capabilities. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 750.300(b)(2). BNA-SUTN IL 31.6.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Payment Methods ACH Credit and ACH Debit

Required for Certain Taxpayers There are two options to pay by electronic funds transfer. ACH credit instructs a taxpayer's financial institution to transfer funds from their account to the Department of Revenue's account and ACH debit is the taxpayer's instruction to the Department of Revenue to take payment from a taxpayer's account. Illinois Publication PUB-8. BNA-SUTN IL 31.6.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Vendor Collection Discounts

1.75% Each retailer required or authorized to collect tax must pay the Illinois Department of Revenue the amount of the tax at the time of the return for the period during which such tax was collected, less a discount of 1.75 percent or $5 per calendar year, whichever is greater. 35 ILCS 105/9; 35 ILCS 110/9; 35 ILCS 115/9; 35 ILCS 120/3. This discount is allowed to reimburse the retailer for expenses incurred in collecting the tax, keeping records, preparing and filing returns, remitting the tax and supplying data to the department on request. For retailers who report and pay the tax on a transaction by transaction basis the discount will be taken with each such tax remittance instead of when the retailer files a periodic return. 35 ILCS 105/9; 35 ILCS 110/9; 35 ILCS 115/9; 35 ILCS 120/3.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Resale Exemption Certificates

Accepted A certificate of resale is accepted as prima facie proof that sales covered by it were made for resale. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.1405(b); Illinois Publication PUB-104. Except in the case of sales to totally exempt purchasers, when sales for resale are made, sellers should, for their protection, take a Certificate of Resale from the purchaser. Mere statements by sellers that property was sold for resale will not be accepted by the department without corroborative evidence. Certificates of Resale may be made a part of purchase orders signed by the purchaser. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.1405(a). A Certificate of Resale is a statement signed by the purchaser that the property purchased by him is purchased for purposes of resale. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.1405(b); see also Illinois General Information Letter ST 12-0018-GIL (March 27, 2012). The certificate must include:• the seller's name and address; • the purchaser's name and address; • a description of the items being purchased for resale; • a statement from the purchaser that the items are being purchased for resale; • the purchaser's signature, or the signature of an authorized employee or agent of the purchaser, and date of signing; and • the purchaser's active account ID or resale number issued by the Illinois Department of Revenue, or purchaser statement that the purchaser is an out-of-state purchaser who will always sell and deliver to his or her customers outside Illinois. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.1405(b); Illinois Publication PUB-104. The sale of tangible personal property for purposes of resale in any form as tangible personal property will be exempt so long as the purchaser has an active registration number or active resale number from the department and gives the number to the vendor in connection with certifying to the vendor that the sale to the purchaser is nontaxable on the ground of being a sale for resale. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.120(c). BNA-SUTN IL 31.8.7.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Entity Exemption Certificates

Required To document an exemption for sales to tax exempt entities, such as churches, charities, schools, county fair organizations and certain senior organizations, a seller must request from the purchaser a copy of the purchaser's exemption certificate issued by the Illinois Department of Revenue or the purchaser's “E” number. Illinois Publication PUB-104. If the seller accepts the purchaser's “E” number, the seller must then verify the validity of this number by calling the department or using the department's website. Illinois Publication PUB-104. BNA-SUTN IL 31.8.8.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Use-Based Exemption Certificates

Required A certificate of exemption must be presented to the seller for each transaction where exempt machinery or equipment is purchased stating the facts establishing the exemption for the transaction. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.330(g); Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0036-GIL (June 19, 2015). For farm machinery and equipment, Form “ST-587 - Equipment Exemption Certificate”or other certification containing the information required on that form must be submitted to the seller by the purchaser for each transaction on which the exemption is claimed. If a user has an active registration or resale number, that number may be given in lieu of the Form ST-587. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.330(g); Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0036-GIL (June 19, 2015). The certificate must include the seller's name and address, the purchaser's name and address, a statement that the property purchased will be used primarily in production agriculture or in state or federal agricultural programs, and the purchaser's signature and the date of signing. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.305(m). Manufacturing Machinery and Equipment To document an exemption for manufacturing machinery and equipment, a seller must keep in his or her records one of the following:• the purchaser's active account ID or resale number issued by the Illinois Department of Revenue;or • an exemption certificate containing the seller's name and address, the purchaser's name and address, an identification or description of the items purchased, a statement from the purchaser that the items are being used primarily in manufacturing or assembling items for wholesale or retail sale or lease, and the purchaser's signature and the date of signing. Illinois Publication PUB-104. Enterprise Zones To document an exemption for property used or consumed in an enterprise zone, a seller must keep in its records:• a copy of the current certificate of eligibility issued by the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity; and • a written statement signed by the certified business that the items are being purchased for use or consumption at a location within an enterprise zone. Illinois Publication PUB-104. Once a business has a current copy of the certificate of eligibility and statement of exemption on file, the certified business may claim the exemption on subsequent purchases from a purchaser. The business must indicate on the purchase order that the item or items are exempt by referencing the certificate of eligibility and statement of exemption. The exemption can only be claimed as long as the certificate of eligibility is current and made during the effective period of the certificate of eligibility specified by Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity. Illinois Publication PUB-104. BNA-SUTN IL 31.8.9.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Direct Pay Permits

Authorized Participants in the Illinois direct-payment program may purchase tangible personal property from retailers without paying tax. Rather, the purchaser remits the tax directly to the department. 35 ILCS 105/3-10.5. To qualify for a direct pay permit, applicants must:• demonstrate their ability to comply with the Illinois' sales and use tax laws, including reporting and payment requirements; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2520(a). and • provide a written description of the accounting systems that will be used by the applicant and demonstrate that the accounting systems will reflect the proper amount of tax due; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2520(a). • have a valid business purpose for requesting a permit; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2520(b). and • demonstrate how direct payment will benefit tax compliance. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2520(b). For a permit holder to be relieved of his obligation to pay tax at the time of purchase, the permit holder must provide the retailer with a copy of the permit, unless the retailer already has a copy on file. Once the permit holder uses his permit to be relieved of paying tax to a particular retailer, he must use the permit for all of his purchases of qualifying tangible personal property from that retailer. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2500(c). Use of a permit relieves the permit holder from paying use tax to the retailer at the time of purchase. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2500(a). By using the permit, the permit holder voluntarily agrees to assume the liabilities of the retailer to report and remit retailers' occupation tax direct to the department. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2500(a). Permit holders must make all payments to the department through the use of electronic funds transfer. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2510(d). Payment of tax is due no later than the twentieth day of the month following the month in which the purchase was made. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2510(c). Permit holders purchasing qualifying tangible personal property may take the 1.75 percent retailers' discount. Retailers who are presented a direct pay permit on purchases of qualifying tangible personal property are not allowed the 1.75 percent retailers' discount on those sales. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2500(d). Retailers given a direct pay permit for purchasing qualifying tangible personal property are relieved of their obligation to remit the retailers' occupation tax incurred. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2500(b). The retailers must report the sales as exempt on their sales and use tax return. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2500(b). Qualifying tangible personal property means tangible personal property purchased at retail that is subject to the retailers' occupation tax, use tax, and any local occupations taxes. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2505(c). Only the person to whom the direct pay permit was issued may use the permit. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2505(d). BNA-SUTN IL 31.8.10.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Record-Keeping Requirements

No Specific Time Period Every retailer required or authorized to collect taxes and every person using tangible personal property in Illinois which was purchased at retail from a retailer must keep the records, receipts, invoices and other pertinent books, documents, memoranda and papers as the Illinois Department of Revenue requires and in the form as the department requires. 35 ILCS 105/11; 35 ILCS 110/11; 35 ILCS 115/11; 35 ILCS 120/7. The term “records”means all data maintained by the taxpayer, including data on paper, microfilm, microfiche or any type of machine-sensible data compilation. 35 ILCS 105/11; 35 ILCS 110/11; 35 ILCS 115/11; 35 ILCS 120/7. The Illinois Department of Revenue, or any officer or employee designated by the department in writing by the Director, may hold investigations and hearings and may examine any books, papers, records, documents or memoranda of any retailer or purchaser bearing upon the taxable sales or purchases of tangible personal property, and may require the attendance of such person or any officer or employee of such person, or of any person having knowledge of the facts, and may take testimony and require proof for its information. 35 ILCS 105/11; 35 ILCS 110/11; 35 ILCS 115/11; 35 ILCS 120/7. Retailers must retain cash register tapes and other data which will provide a daily record of their gross amount of sales. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.805(a); Illinois Administrative Hearing ST 17-01 (Feb. 3, 2017). To support deductions made on the tax return on account of receipts from isolated or occasional sales, sales for resale, sales to governmental bodies or other exempted types of purchasers, sales of tangible personal property in interstate commerce, and any other kind of transaction that is not subject the entries in any books, records or other pertinent papers or documents of the taxpayer must detailed sufficient enough to show the name and address of the taxpayer's customer in each such transaction, the character of every such transaction, the date of every such transaction, the amount of receipts realized from every such transaction and such other information as may be necessary to establish the nontaxable character of the transaction. 35 ILCS 120/7. Except in the case of a sale to a purchaser who will always resell and deliver the property to his customers outside of Illinois, anyone claiming that he has made a nontaxable sale for resale must also keep a record of the purchaser's registration number or resale number with the department. 35 ILCS 120/7. BNA-SUTN IL 31.9.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Refunds

Vendor Tax that is paid voluntarily, but erroneously, may be recovered by filing a timely claim for refund. 35 ILCS 120/6; 35 ILCS 105/19; 35 ILCS 110/17; 35 ILCS 115/17. A taxpayer who erroneously pays taxes, penalty, or interest due to either a mistake of fact or law, may file a claim for credit with the department. Only the person who remitted the erroneously paid tax may apply for a refund. To receive a credit, the taxpayer must demonstrate either that it bore the economic burden of the tax or, if the taxpayer is a retailer that collected the tax from its purchasers, that it unconditionally refunded the tax to its purchasers. The unconditional repayment requirement is satisfied if the retailer provides an unconditional promissory note or irrevocable credit memoranda to its purchasers. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.1501(a)(2);Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0039-GIL (June 24, 2015); Illinois General Information Letter ST 14-0006-GIL (March 7, 2014); see also Illinois General Information Letter ST 17-0007-GIL (March 2, 2017) (based on the questions posed in the Bloomberg Tax Survey of State Tax Departments); Illinois General Information Letter ST 17-0002-GIL (Jan. 19, 2017) (purchasers may not obtain refund without going through seller; only party who paid tax may file claim); Illinois General Information Letter 15-0056-GIL (Aug. 28, 2015) (only persons who have actually paid tax to the department can claim a credit; a purchaser who has paid tax to a retailer cannot make a claim). If the department determines that it should issue a credit memorandum or refund, the department may first apply the amount against any tax, penalty, or interest due under the retailers' occupation tax, use tax, service occupation tax, service use tax, or any local occupation or use tax. Otherwise the taxpayer will be issued a credit memorandum or refund. 35 ILCS 120/6. The department will make cash refunds in hardship cases. The two most likely situations are where: • the taxpayer has discontinued business; and • the taxpayer will incur only a small liability to the department in the foreseeable future, but receives a large credit memorandum that will take a long time to liquidate. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.1510. In the event that a cash refund is not allowed in these two situations, the taxpayer is likely to sell the credit memorandum at a loss to realize something from it within any reasonable period of time. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.1510. No claim is allowed for any amount paid to the department if paid in liquidation of an assessment that became final before the claim for credit or refund to recover the amount paid is filed, or if paid in liquidation of a judgment or court order. 35 ILCS 120/6. Any credit or refund allowed will bear interest at the rate determined under 35 ILCS 735/3-2. 35 ILCS 120/6. BNA-SUTN IL 31.10.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Statute of Limitations Refund Requests

3 Years All claims for credit or refund filed on or after each Jan. 1 or July 1 must be made no later than three years after such Jan. 1 and July 1, respectively. When the department and taxpayer have agreed to an extension of time to issue a Notice of Tax Liability a claim may be filed any time prior to the expiration of the extension. 35 ILCS 120/6; Illinois Administrative Hearing ST 18-03 (June 12, 2017). BNA-SUTN IL 31.11.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Statute of Limitations Assessment of Additional Tax

3 Years Generally, no Notice of Tax Liability may be issued on or after each Jan. 1 and July 1 covering gross receipts during any month more than three years prior to such Jan. 1 or July 1. 35 ILCS 120/4; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.815(c). The three-year statute of limitations does not apply where the department has notified the taxpayer of a Notice of Tax within the statute of limitations, even though the return had not been corrected by the department prior to the issuance of the notice. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.815(c). The statute of limitations is tolled any time an Order of any Court has the effect of enjoining or restraining the department from issuing the Notice of Tax Liability. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.815(e). Similarly, when a tax, penalty, or interest is due and payable, and the taxpayer is out of the state, or after the tax becomes due and payable, the taxpayer leaves the state, the Statute of Limitations is tolled for the period of time that the taxpayer is out of the state. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.815(d). If a fraudulent return is filed, or a taxpayer fails to file a return, there is no limitation on the period of time in which the department may issue a Notice of Tax Liability. Moreover, there is no statute of limitations in the case of failure to file a return. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.815(c). The taxpayer may also execute a written waiver to extend the statute of limitations. 35 ILCS 120/4. For purposes of the use tax and service use tax, the statute of limitations runs from the date when the tax is due rather than the date when gross receipts are received. Additionally, for the use tax and service use tax no Notice of Tax Liability can be issued on or after six years from that July 1 or Jan. 1 covering the tax due with the return. 35 ILCS 105/12; 35 ILCS 110/12. Local Statute of Limitations With limited exceptions not applicable to statutes of limitations, local retailers' occupation, service occupation, and use taxes administered by the Illinois Department of Revenue are subject to the same administrative procedures as apply to state retailers'occupation, service occupation, and use taxes. 65 ILCS 5/8-11-1; 65 ILCS 5/8-11-5; 55 ILCS 5/5-1006; 55 ILCS 5/5-1007; 65 ILCS 5/8-11-1.3; 65 ILCS 5/8-11-1.4; 65 ILCS 5/8-11-1.6; 65 ILCS 5/8-11-1.7; 55 ILCS 5/5-1006.5(a), (b); 55 ILCS 5/5-1006.7(a), (b); 70 ILCS 3610/5.01(b), (c); 70 ILCS 1605/30(a), (b). BNA-SUTN IL 31.11.2.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Civil Penalties

Yes Penalties are assessed in accordance with the guidelines of §3-3 of the Uniform Penalty and Interest Act for taxpayers that fail to file and taxpayers that file after the deadline. 35 ILCS 120/5. The penalty for failure to pay tax shown due on a return is:• 2 percent of any amount paid within 30 days; • 10 percent of any amount paid later than 30 days but before the date the Illinois Department of Revenue has initiated an audit or investigation of the taxpayer; • 20 percent of any amount paid after the date the Illinois Department of Revenue initiated an audit or investigation of the taxpayer, but the penalty will be reduced to 15 percent if the entire amount due is paid no later than 30 days after the Illinois Department of Revenue provides the taxpayer with an amended return. 35 ILCS 735/3-3(b-20). Failure to File Penalty A penalty for failure to file a return or to show the full amount of any tax required to be shown on a timely return is imposed at a rate equal to:• 2 percent of any amount of tax shown on a return or amended return up to a maximum of $250, reduced by any tax paid on time or by an allowable credit; and • an additional penalty of the greater of $250 or 2 percent of the tax shown on the return if a return is not filed within 30 days after the notice of nonfiling is mailed by the department. 35 ILCS 735/3-3(a-10). There is an additional penalty of $100 imposed for failure to timely file a transaction reporting return. The penalty is imposed regardless of whether the taxpayer would owe taxes had the return been filed. 35 ILCS 735/3-3(a-15), as amended by 2013 Ill. H.B. 2518, effective Aug. 16, 2013. Fraudulent Filing Additional penalties apply to the filing of fraudulent returns. Unlike penalties for failure to pay or file, fraudulent return penalties need to be proven by the department through sufficiently clear and convincing evidence that the deficiency is the result of fraud. The department bears the burden of proof that fraud actually occurred. Illinois Administrative Hearing ST 13-20 (July 16, 2013). Amnesty-Related Penalty In late 2003, Illinois offered an amnesty program covering tax periods between July 1, 1983, and June 30, 2002. Legislation authorizing the amnesty program also authorizes a special penalty equal to 200 percent of the ordinary penalty and interest charges with respect to any tax liability that was eligible for, but not paid during the amnesty period. 35 ILCS 735/3-2(f). Illinois also imposed a 200 percent penalty for unpaid tax liabilities during an amnesty program covering June 30, 2002 through July 1, 2009. 35 ILCS 735/3-2(g). Reasonable Cause Exception A showing of reasonable cause on the part of the taxpayer may make the penalties inapplicable. Reasonable cause is determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all facts and circumstances. 35 ILCS 735/3-8; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 700.400(b). The most important factor in determining whether the penalty should be abated is the taxpayer's showing that he made a good faith effort to file the return and pay his liability in a timely fashion. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 700.400(b). A good faith effort may be demonstrated by the exercise of ordinary business care and prudence in determining and paying the tax liability. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 700.400(c); see also Illinois Administrative Hearing UT 13-02 (Jan. 28, 2013). The department will consider the taxpayer's filing history and isolated computational or transcriptional errors will not generally indicate a lack of good faith. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 700.400(c). Examples of reasonable cause include:• the department altering or amending a rule that affects the return after it has been filed; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 700.400(e)(1). • the taxpayer, the preparer, or an immediate family member of the taxpayer has died or become seriously ill or incapacitated; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 700.400(e)(2). • unforeseeable circumstances prevented the taxpayer from filing a timely return; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 700.400(e)(3). • inability to timely obtain records necessary to determine the amount of tax due to reasons beyond the taxpayer's control; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 700.400(e)(4). • factors beyond the taxpayer's control, such as fire or natural disaster, destroyed the taxpayer's records; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 700.400(e)(5). • the taxpayer mailed the return in a timely manner but the return was not delivered to the department within the prescribed time period; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 700.400(e)(6). • the taxpayer made an honest mistake and inadvertently mailed the return to another state government office or to the Internal Revenue Service; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 700.400(e)(7). and • an Illinois appellate court decision, a U.S. appellate court decision, or another jurisdiction supports the taxpayer's position. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 700.400(e)(8). Reasonable cause does not exist when a taxpayer is aware of a filing requirement, but unaware of the penalty imposed when there is a failure to file on time. See Illinois Administrative Hearing ST 15-18 (Oct. 20, 2015) (taxpayer had been in business for 68 years and knew about filing requirements but was unaware that the law had changed in 2013 to add a $100 penalty per transaction when there is a failure to timely file; there is no statutory requirement for the department to notify individuals of a change in law and there was also no ambiguity regarding how the penalty would apply to exempt or non-exempt transactions). Corporate Officers and Employees Any employee, officer, agent, or other person who has control, supervision, or responsibility for filing returns and remitting tax payments will be held personally liable for willfully failing to file a return or for filing a fraudulent return. The penalty assessed in such instances is equal to the total amount of tax due, plus penalties and interest. 35 ILCS 120/13.5. The willfulness requirement has been held to be a rebuttable presumption that the taxpayer may overcome with sufficient evidence. That is, the Department of Revenue can establish its prima facie case of willfulness merely by introducing a Notice of Penalty Liability. Branson v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 168 Ill. 2d 247, 659 N.E.2d 961 (Ill. 1995) (the department's only obligation is to establish a prima facie case, not to affirmatively prove willfulness; willfulness is an issue containing both elements of fact and law, and disproving willfulness requires a review of the circumstances of each individual case in its entirety). The Illinois False Claims Act and Qui Tam Actions Illinois allows non-government parties to bring cases under the Illinois False Claims Act, an anti-fraud statute modeled on the federal False Claims Act. See 740 ILCS 175/1 et seq; see, e.g., State ex rel. Schad, Diamond & Shedden, P.C. v. Nat'l Bus. Furniture, LLC, 2016 IL App (1st) 150526, 2016 BL 249483 (Ill. App. Ct. 2016). Pursuant to the Illinois False Claims Act, if a party perpetrates fraud against Illinois, then the party is liable for civil penalties and triple damages. 740 ILCS 175/3(a)(1). Claims can be brought on the State's behalf by the Attorney General or by a private person—referred to as a relator—in a qui tam action. 740 ILCS 175/4(a) - 740 ILCS 175/4(c). In a qui tam action, Illinois can choose to intervene or can let the relator proceed with the litigation. 740 ILCS 175/4(b)(4). The relator is considered a party to the action and is entitled to a percentage of the proceeds or settlement if the suit is successful. 740 ILCS 175/4(a) - 740 ILCS 175/4(c)(1); 740 ILCS 175/4(d). The relator does not need to show that an actual transaction was completed in which tax was not properly collected; allegations creating the probable inference that such fraud occurred is sufficient. Illinois ex rel. Lindblom v. Sears Brands, LLC, 2019 IL App (1st) 180588, 2019 BL 144095 (Ill. App. Ct. April 23, 2019). A relator may not bring suit under the False Claims Act if the subject of the suit is also the subject of a civil suit or an administrative civil money penalty in which the State is a party. 740 ILCS 175/4(e)(3); Illinois ex rel. Lindblom v. Sears Brands, LLC, 2018 IL App (1st) 171468, 2018 BL 135421 (Ill. App. Ct. 2018) (this limitation prohibits “parasitic” actions that duplicate the State's proceedings).

Sears Brands, LLC, 2018 IL App (1st) 171468, 2018 BL 135421 (Ill. App. Ct. 2018) (the “bar”would be triggered by the subject requesting an administrative hearing or initiating a civil suit under the Protest Monies Act). Further, the “public action bar”precludes qui tam suits if the alleged fraud was publicly disclosed prior to the suit being filed, unless the relator was an original source. 740 ILCS 175/4(e)(4)(A); Illinois ex rel. Lindblom v. Sears Brands, LLC, 2019 IL App (1st) 180588, 2019 BL 144095 (Ill. App. Ct. April 23, 2019) (general information letters and private letter rulings which did not name the defendant were not public disclosures of alleged fraudulent activity). In Illinois ex rel. Schad v. My Pillow, the Illinois Appellate Court upheld the trial court's judgment that the taxpayer was liable under the state's False Claims Act for failing to collect and remit sales and use tax on its Illinois telephone and Internet sales. (The trial court did not hold the taxpayer liable for craft show sales made in Illinois.) The appellate court agreed that My Pillow acted with knowing and reckless disregard of the tax law by its failure take the prudent action of inquiring as to its potential tax liability for its telephone and Internet sales, despite the general unsettled nature of use tax law. The court also upheld the award of treble damages against the taxpayer, 30 percent of which is awarded to the relator for handling the lawsuit without the state's intervention, pursuant to Illinois' False Claims Act. However, the appellate court reversed the award of attorney's fees to the relator, a law firm, using its own in-house attorneys to prosecute the false claims suit. The court questioned the “independence” of the lawyers for the relator from the relator itself, because the lead attorney representing the relator, was also the president and final decision-maker for the relator. The circumstances justified denying attorney's fees for “lack of objective, independent counsel.”The court pointed out that the specific relator in this case “has made a business out of filing these false-claims cases as a party-plaintiff,”but noted that its ruling does not prevent the firm from continuing its false claims act practice. The court explained that its ruling simply prevents the relator from recovering attorney's fees for its own legal work where the relator also serves as the client in a matter. Consistently, the court did uphold the trial court's award of attorney's fees for legal work performed on behalf of the relator by outside counsel. State ex rel. Schad, Diamond & Shedden, P.C. v. My Pillow, Inc., No. 1-15-2668, 2017 BL 204809, 2017 IL App (1st) 152668 (Ill. App. Ct. June 15, 2017), affirmed by 2018 IL 122487, 2018 BL 340172 (Ill. 2018). The Illinois Supreme Court affirmed the Appellate Court's ruling, citing the rule that a “lawyer representing himself or herself simply does not incur legal fees.” State ex rel. Schad, Diamond & Shedden, P.C. v. My Pillow, Inc., 2018 IL 122487, 2018 BL 340172 (Ill. 2018) (citing Hamer v. Lentz, 132 Ill.2d 49 (1989)). BNA-SUTN IL 31.12.1.

Yes Civil penalties for filing a return late shall be waived if the taxpayer can demonstrate reasonable cause for the lateness. 35 ILCS 735/3-8; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 700.400(b). Reasonable cause is determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all facts and circumstances. 35 ILCS 735/3-8; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 700.400(b). The most important factor in determining whether the penalty should be abated is the taxpayer's showing that he made a good faith effort to file the return and pay his liability in a timely fashion. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 700.400(b). A good faith effort may be demonstrated by the exercise of ordinary business care and prudence in determining and paying the tax liability. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 700.400(c); see also Illinois Administrative Hearing UT 13-02 (Jan. 28, 2013). The department will consider the taxpayer's filing history and isolated computational or transcriptional errors will not generally indicate a lack of good faith. Ill. Admin.

Federal underpayment rate The Illinois interest rate on underpayments of tax is equal to the federal interest rate on underpayments of tax, which is calculated by adding 3 percent to the federal short-term interest rate. 35 ILCS 735/3-2; I.R.C. § 6621(a)(2). The rate is adjusted twice each year, on Jan. 1 and July 1, and will be the federal rate scheduled to be in effect on those adjustment dates. 35 ILCS 735/3-2(b); see Illinois Publication PUB-103. Interest accrues on underpayments beginning the day after the payment due date through the date the tax is paid. However, if the tax due is paid within 30 days of a notice and demand for payment, interest will not be imposed for the period after the date of such notice and demand. 35 ILCS 735/3-2(c-5); Illinois Publication PUB-103.

Yes Illinois enacted an amnesty bill providing for an amnesty application period from Oct. 1, 2010, through Nov. 8, 2010, applicable to taxable periods from June 30, 2002, through July 1, 2009. Taxpayers that received amnesty under this program were entitled to the abatement of penalties and interest on taxes covered by their amnesty applications. 35 ILCS 745/10, as amended by 2010 Ill. S.B. 377, effective Aug. 16, 2010. Eligible taxpayers who failed to satisfy their liabilities during the five-week amnesty period incurred penalties and interest in an amount that was 200 percent of the penalty and interest that would have otherwise been imposed. 35 ILCS 735/3-2(g). The program followed the previous amnesty program that ran from Oct. 1, 2003, through Nov. 15, 2003. The amnesty program provided that, upon payment by a taxpayer of all taxes due from that taxpayer to the State of Illinois for any taxable period ending after June 30, 1983, and prior to July 1, 2002, the Illinois Department of Revenue would not seek to collect any interest or penalties that were applicable, and the department would not seek civil or criminal prosecution for any taxpayer for the period of time for which amnesty has been granted to the taxpayer. 35 ILCS 745/10. However, failure to pay all taxes due to the State of Illinois for a taxable period would invalidate any amnesty granted. 35 ILCS 745/10.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Voluntary Disclosure Relief

Yes Illinois offers a voluntary disclosure program through which eligible taxpayers who owe back taxes and have not filed related returns can avoid penalties and possible criminal charges. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 210.126, as amended by 43 Ill. Reg. 5315 (May 10, 2019), effective April 24, 2019; Illinois Informational Bulletin FY 2019-13 (October 2018). The voluntary disclosure program is available to taxpayers not yet registered for the tax type for which they are seeking relief and for whom no investigations or collection actions have begun. Eligible taxpayers that come forward voluntarily must file an application for voluntary disclosure on a form prescribed by the PRD. An application is not accepted by the PRD until it has been approved and signed by a member of the Board of Appeals, who may only sign an application when the department has confirmed that it has not initiated an audit or investigation of the taxpayer. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 210.126(b)(1), as amended by 43 Ill. Reg. 5315 (May 10, 2019), effective April 24, 2019; Illinois Informational Bulletin FY 2019-13 (October 2018). Voluntary disclosure applications must be sent to the Illinois Department of Revenue — Problems Resolution Division (PRD) of the Taxpayer Services Program. Prior to August 2018, applications were required to be send to the Board of Appeals. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 210.126(b), as amended by 43 Ill. Reg. 5315 (May 10, 2019), effective April 24, 2019; Illinois Informational Bulletin FY 2019-13 (October 2018). Once the taxpayer is notified that their voluntary disclosure application has been approved and executed, the taxpayer must file returns for the disclosed tax for the last four years and pay all tax and interest within 30 days from the date the board member signed the application. The taxpayer must document the methodology it used to determine its tax liability for the voluntary disclosure period.
