Incidental to Service Michigan uses the “incidental to service” test when categorizing business relationships that involve both the provision of services and the transfer of tangible personal property. See Catalina Mktg. Sales Corp. v. Michigan Dept. of Treas., 470 Mich. 13 (2004) (adopting the incidental to service test and rejecting the “real object test”). Under the incidental to service test, a court looks objectively at the entire transaction to determine whether it is principally a transfer of tangible personal property or a provision of a service. Catalina Mktg. Sales Corp. v. Michigan Dept. of Treas., 470 Mich. 13 (2004) (adopting the incidental to service test and rejecting the “real object test”); see also Thomson Reuters Inc. v. Michigan Dept. of Treas., No. 313825, 2014 BL 134598 (Mich. Ct. App. May 13, 2014) (holding that subscription fees paid for use of the taxpayer's online tax and accounting research program were payments primarily for information services—not tangible personal property—because “subscribers primarily sought access to up-to-date information,” not ownership or responsibility of prewritten computer software). Sales tax does not apply if “the rendering of a service is the object of the transaction, even though tangible personal property is exchanged incidentally.” Catalina Mktg. Sales Corp. v. Michigan Dept. of Treas., 470 Mich. 13 (2004) (adopting the incidental to service test and rejecting the “real object test”); see also Thomson Reuters Inc. v. Michigan Dept. of Treas., No. 313825, 2014 BL 134598 (Mich. Ct. App. May 13, 2014) (holding that subscription fees paid for use of the taxpayer's online tax and accounting research program were payments primarily for information services—not tangible personal property—because “subscribers primarily sought access to up-to-date information,” not ownership or responsibility of prewritten computer software). The incidental to service test involves an analysis of six factors, namely:(1) the buyer's reason for engaging in the transaction; (2) the seller or service provider's business; (3) whether the goods were provided as a retail enterprise with a profit-making motive; (4) whether the tangible goods were available for sale without the service; (5) the extent to which intangible services contributed to the transferred physical item's value; and (6) any other factors relevant to the transaction. Catalina Mktg. Sales Corp. v. Michigan Dept. of Treas., 470 Mich. 13 (2004) (adopting the incidental to service test and rejecting the “real object test”). For transactions where a service provider is strictly engaged in the sale of tangible personal property, and the transaction is not incidental to the service, a taxpayer can be found retroactively liable for sales tax in the event of an audit. Michigan Administrative Decision 448604 (Aug. 28, 2013). BNA-SUTN MI 9.3.1.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Bundled Transactions

Taxable A bundled transaction that contains both taxable and non-taxable items is considered a retail sale subject to tax. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.93a(4)(a). The entire price is subject to tax unless one element of the bundle is a telecommunications service. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.93a(4)(a). In the case of a bundled transaction that includes telecommunication services, if the seller has maintained books and records identifying the portions of the price that are attributable to the distinct and separately identifiable exempt products, then the products are not considered part of a bundled transaction and may be excluded from the sales price subject to tax. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.93a(4)(a). A “bundled transaction” is a taxable retail sale of two or more products, not including real property and services to real property, if the products are distinct and identifiable products and sold for one non-itemized price. A bundled transaction does not include the sale of any products in which the sales price varies, or is negotiable, based on the selection by the purchaser of the products included in the transaction. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.93a(5)(b). Distinct and identifiable products do not include:packaging such as containers, boxes, sacks, bags, and bottles or other materials such as wrapping, labels, tags, and instruction guides that accompany the retail sale of the products and are incidental or immaterial to the retail sale. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.93a(5)(b)(i)(A). Examples of packaging that are incidental or immaterial include grocery sacks, shoeboxes, dry cleaning garment bags, and express delivery envelopes and boxes. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.93a(5)(b)(i)(A). A product provided free-of-charge with the required purchase of another product is also not a distinct and identifiable product. A product is provided free-of-charge if the sales price of the product purchased does not vary depending on the inclusion of the product provided free of charge. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.93a(5)(b)(i)(B). The phrase “one nonitemized price”does not include a price that is separately identified by product on binding sales or other supporting sales-related documentation made available to the customer in paper or electronic form, including an invoice, bill of sale, receipt, contract, service agreement, lease agreement, periodic notice of rates and services, rate card, or price list. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.93a(5)(b)(iv). Transactions Considered to Not Be Bundled Transactions A transaction that otherwise meets the definition of a bundled transaction is not a taxable bundled transaction if the transaction is described by any one of the following statements:• The retail sale of tangible personal property and a service where the tangible personal property is essential to the use of the service, and is provided exclusively in connection with the service, and the true object of the transaction is the service. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.93a(5)(b)(v)(A). • The retail sale of services where one service is provided that is essential to the use or receipt of a second service and the first service is provided exclusively in connection with the second service and the true object of the transaction is the second service. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.93a(5)(b)(v)(B). • A transaction that includes taxable products and nontaxable products and the purchase price or sales price of the taxable products is de minimis: Mich. Comp. Laws §205.93a(5)(b)(v)(C). o De minimis means the seller's purchase price or sales price of the taxable products is 10 percent or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled products. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.93a(5)(b)(v)(C). o Sellers must use either the purchase price or the sales price of the products to determine if the taxable products are de minimis. Sellers may not use a combination of the purchase price and sales price of the products to determine if the taxable products are de minimis. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.93a(5)(b)(v)(C). o Sellers must use the full term of a service contract to determine if the taxable products are de minimis. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.93a(5)(b)(v)(C). • The retail sale of exempt tangible personal property and taxable tangible personal property where: Mich. Comp. Laws §205.93a(5)(b)(v)(D). o the transaction includes food and food ingredients, drugs, durable medical equipment, mobility-enhancing equipment, over-the-counter drugs, prosthetic devices, or medical supplies; Mich. Comp. Laws §205.93a(5)(b)(v)(D)(I). and o if the seller's purchase price or sales price of the taxable tangible personal property is 50 percent or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled tangible personal property. Sellers may not use a combination of the purchase price and sales price of the tangible personal property when making the 50 percent determination for a transaction. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.93a(5)(b)(v)(D)(II). BNA-SUTN MI 9.3.2.
