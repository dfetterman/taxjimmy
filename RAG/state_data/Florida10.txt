Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Leases and Rentals

Destination Tangible Personal Property Florida has not adopted special sourcing rules for leases or rentals of tangible personal property. Fla. Stat. §212.05(1)(d). Generally, Florida uses destination-based sourcing for sales of goods and services. Fla. Stat. §212.054(3)(a)1. Motor Vehicles If a motor vehicle is leased or rented in Florida for a period of less than 12 months, the entire amount of the rental is taxable, even if the vehicle is dropped off in another state.

If a motor vehicle is leased or rented for 12 months or more, sales tax is due on the lease or rental payments if the vehicle is registered in Florida. However, no tax is due if the taxpayer documents use of the vehicle outside the state and tax is being paid on the lease or rental payments in another state. Fla. Stat. §212.05(1)(c)(2).

In addition to state taxes paid, Florida allows a taxpayer to take a credit against Florida state taxes due for local taxes paid as well as taxes paid to the District of Columbia. Fla. Stat. §212.06(7); Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.091(3); see also Florida Tax Brochure No. 00A01-36.

Florida gives a credit on motor vehicles brought into Florida where a like tax has been imposed and paid in another state. If the like tax amount is equal to or greater than the amount imposed by Florida, no additional tax is due. If the amount is less than the amount imposed by Florida, only the difference between the two is due.

Exemption Allowed Motor Vehicles Sold in Florida to Residents of Another State Florida law allows a partial sales and use tax exemption for a motor vehicle purchased by a resident of another state. Florida Tax Information Publication 18A01-01R2 (July 25, 2018); Florida Tax Information Publication 16A01-24 (Dec. 28, 2016). Specifically, the tax imposed in Florida is the amount of state sales tax that would be imposed by the purchaser's home state if the vehicle were purchased in that state; however, the tax imposed must not exceed the Florida 6% tax rate. The tax collected is Florida tax and must be paid to the Florida Department of Revenue. Florida Tax Information Publication 18A01-01R2 (July 25, 2018); Florida Tax Information Publication 18A01-01R (Feb. 28, 2018); Florida Tax Information Publication 16A01-24 (Dec. 28, 2016). The nonresident purchaser is required to complete Form DR-123, Affidavit for Partial Exemption of Motor Vehicle Sold for Licensing in Another State, declaring the intent to license the vehicle in his or her home state within 45 days of the date of purchase. The completed Form DR-123 is provided to the selling dealer or, if purchased from an individual, to the tax collector or private tag agent when purchasing a temporary tag for the vehicle. If the nonresident purchaser licenses the motor vehicle in his or her home state within 45 days from the date of purchase, there is no requirement that the motor vehicle be removed from Florida. Florida Tax Information Publication 18A01-01R (Feb. 28, 2018); Florida Tax Information Publication 16A01-24 (Dec. 28, 2016).

Florida Tax Information Publication 18A01-01R2 (July 25, 2018); Florida Tax Information Publication 18A01-01R (Feb. 28, 2018); Florida Tax Information Publication 16A01-24 (Dec. 28, 2016).

The nonresident purchaser must meet the following requirements:• The nonresident purchaser must sign an affidavit (Form GT-500003) stating that he or she has read the law and rules regarding the specific exemption claimed and agrees to remove the boat from Florida; • A boat of less than 5 net tons of admeasurement must leave Florida within 10 days of purchase or immediately be placed in the care, custody, and control of a registered repair facility for repairs, additions, or alterations. The boat must leave Florida within 20 days after completion of the repairs; • If the boat is 5 net tons of admeasurement or larger, the purchaser may obtain a set of Florida Department of Revenue boat decals, which authorize the boat to remain in Florida waters up to 90 days after the purchase. This period may be extended to 180 days with the purchase of a 90-day extension decal. The decals must be obtained from the selling dealer or broker; • Within 5 days of the date of sale, the dealer or broker must provide the Department with a copy of the invoice, bill of sale, or closing statement, and the original, signed, removal affidavit; • Within 10 days of removing the boat, the nonresident purchaser must furnish the Department with proof that the boat left Florida; • Receipts for fuel, dockage, or repairs purchased outside Florida must identify the boat; • Within 30 days of removal, the nonresident purchaser must provide the Department with written documentation evidencing that the boat was documented, licensed, titled, or registered outside Florida or documentation that the nonresident purchaser has applied for documentation, licensing, titling, or registration of the boat.
