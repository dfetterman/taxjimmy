Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Motor Vehicles, Intrastate or Non-Commercial Use Purchase, Lease, or Rental Transactions

Taxable The retail sale, rental or lease of motor vehicles (e.g., automobiles, motorcycles and trailers) within Kansas is subject to state and local sales and use tax. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3603(a); Kansas Information Guide KS-1526. Vehicles purchased outside of Kansas and subsequently brought into the state and are subject to use tax. When a purchaser pays sales or use tax to another state that is equal to or greater than the Kansas tax due, no Kansas use tax is due when the vehicle is subsequently registered in Kansas. Kansas Information Guide KS-1526. When the sales or use tax rate of another state is less than the Kansas tax rate, the purchaser must pay tax at the rate that is the difference between the rate applied by the other state and the rate applicable in the Kansas location where the vehicle is registered. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3705; Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-30(l)(2); Kansas Information Guide KS-1526. Generally, the base for computing the tax is the actual selling price of the vehicle. However, where the selling price is unknown or bears no reasonable relationship to the fair market value of the vehicle, tax is to be computed on the fair market value. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-30(d). Kansas statutorily defines “motor vehicles”to include every vehicle, other than a motorized bicycle or a motorized wheelchair, which is self-propelled. Kan. Stat. Ann. §8-126(u). (Automobiles and Other Vehicles). Use tax may not be due on a vehicle purchased outside of Kansas if:• when the motor vehicle was purchased, it was intended for bona fide use outside of the state of Kansas; Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-20-13(1). • the first actual use of the automobile was outside of the state of Kansas; Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-20-13(2). • the first actual use of the motor vehicle was substantial and constituted the primary use for which the motor vehicle was purchased. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-20-13(3). Substantial use consists of a minimum of six months of use in the other state. Kansas Information Guide KS-1526. Temporary Presence in State Kansas exempts from sales tax the sale or lease of a motor vehicle, semitrailer, or pole trailer to a bona fide resident of another state, when the vehicle will not be registered in Kansas and will be removed from Kansas within 10 days.

Kansas Information Guide KS-1526. The value of a trade-in to a dealer is an allowable deduction from the gross selling price of the vehicle. A trade-in refers to tangible personal property that will become part of the dealer's inventory for resale. Kansas Information Guide KS-1526. A trade-in allowance is not allowed:• on vehicle transactions between individuals since the trade-in property does not become a part of inventory held for resale; • on transactions where a dealer transfers merchandise in or out of its own resale inventory in exchange for other property is also owns; • when the purchase and trade-in are not part of a single transaction; • for insurance recoveries for damaged or destroyed property assigned or paid to a dealer; and • when the trade-in vehicle is titled to a person or entity that is different from the buyer. Kansas Information Guide KS-1526. An isolated or occasional sale of a motor vehicle or trailer is a sale made between private individuals or other entities that are not retailers registered to collect and remit the sales or use tax on the sale of such a vehicle or trailer at the time of the sale. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-30(a)(1); Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-20-4. Kansas motor vehicle dealers and trailer dealers are considered retailers and cannot make isolated or occasional sales of vehicles or trailers. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-30(a)(2); Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-20-4. Therefore, these dealers are required to collect sales tax at the time of sale on each taxable retail sale of a motor vehicle or trailer. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3603(o); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3703; Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-30(a)(2). However, a person other than a licensed dealer, who makes an isolated or occasional sale of a motor vehicle, is not responsible for collecting and remitting sales tax. Rather, the purchaser is required to pay the sales tax to the Country Treasurer when registering the vehicle. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-30(b); Kansas Information Guide KS-1526. Kansas does not impose tax on the sale or transfer of a vehicle between immediate family members, or on the transfer of a vehicle as a bona fide gift. Kan. Stat.

Lease of Motor Vehicles Vehicle dealers are required to collect sales tax on the total amount of each lease or rental payment made by the lessee. Kansas Information Guide EDU-32A. Kansas treats lease payments as a series of separate sales to the lessee. Kansas Information Guide EDU-32A. There are no deductions for insurance, taxes, services or maintenance contracts, handling or administration charges, late fees, repair or service charges, vehicle trade-ins, or any other charges regardless of how any contract or invoice is stated and whether charges are separately stated or segregated on the same bill. Kansas Information Guide EDU-32A; Kansas Information Guide KS-1526. Moreover, cancellation fees are taxable as part of the final lease payment. Kansas Information Guide EDU-32A. Lease or rental does not include a transfer of possession or control of property under an agreement that requires the transfer of title upon completion of the required payments and payment of any option does not exceed the greater of $100 or 1 percent of the total required payments. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3602(r). Finance leases are treated as sales of tangible personal property and tax is due at the inception of the transaction. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3602(ll)(1); Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-55a; Kansas Information Guide EDU-32A. “Lease or rental” is defined to include Terminal Rental Adjustment Clause agreements covering motor vehicles, which allow the amount of consideration to be increased or decreased by reference to the amount realized upon the sale of disposition of the motor vehicle. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3602(r)(2). As an operating lease, sales tax is to be paid on each periodic lease payment. The exercise of a purchase price option triggers sales and use tax on the purchase price of the motor vehicle. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3602(r); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3602(ll)(1); Kansas Information Guide EDU-32A. This tax is collected and remitted by the lessor, but paid by the lessee. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3604. Rate of Tax: The rate of tax due on leases and rentals of motor vehicles depends on whether or not there are periodic payments for the lease. Kansas Information Guide KS-1526. Lease With Periodic Payments: The lease or rental of a motor vehicle, with recurring periodic payments, is subject to the sales or compensating use tax rate in effect at the motor vehicle's primary location in Kansas. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3603(h); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3670(c)(1); Kansas Information Guide KS-1526; see also Kansas Notice 03-05. If during the term of the lease, the lessee moves to another jurisdiction and registers the vehicle there, the taxes charged on the lease payments will be the rate in effect at the new primary property location (e.g. registration address). Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3670(c)(1); Kansas Information Guide KS-1526; see also Kansas Notice 03-05. Lease Without Periodic Payments: A lease or rental of a motor vehicle that does not require periodic payments is subject to the combined state and local sales or compensating use tax rate in effect at the location where the customer takes delivery of the motor vehicle. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3603(h); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3670(c)(2); Kansas Information Guide KS-1526; see also Kansas Notice 03-05. Lease With Full Payment at Origination: In a scenario where the lessee pays the entire cost of the lease upfront, tax is due on the full amount paid by the lessee to the lessor at the time of the transaction, along with any incidental charges the lessor makes. Kansas Information Guide EDU-32A. Vehicle Rental Excise Tax Motor vehicle rentals not exceeding 28 days with a gross weight less than 12,000 pounds are also subject to a Kansas Vehicle Rental Excise Tax. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-5117(a); Kansas Information Guide KS-1526. The excise tax is in addition to the sales tax, and is computed on the same tax base. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-5117(a); Kansas Information Guide KS-1526. Rebates For sales occurring July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2021, cash rebates granted by a manufacturer to a purchaser or lessee of a new motor vehicle are excluded from the sales price of the motor vehicle if paid directly to the retailer as a result of the original sale. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3602(ll)(3), as amended by 2017 Kan. H.B. 2111, effective July 1, 2018; Kansas Notice 18-02 (July 1, 2018).

Admin. Regs. 92-20-4. A “rebate”is a return of part of the amount paid for a product after the sale, which is commonly obtained by sending proof of purchase to the manufacturer. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3602(ll)(2); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3703; Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-16a(e); Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-20-4. BNA-SUTN KS 29.3.1.
