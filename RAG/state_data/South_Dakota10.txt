Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Services

Destination South Dakota imposes a retail sales tax on business services for any person engaging in any business in which a service is rendered. S.D. Codified Laws Ann. § 10-45-4. Services are subject to sales tax where the service is received, which means where the service is first used by the client. Generally, the service is first used where the client receives the report or results of the service. South Dakota Tax Facts — Architects, Engineers and Surveyors. South Dakota also imposes a use tax for the privilege of using services in South Dakota. S.D. Codified Laws Ann. § 10-46-2.1. This approach results in charging the use tax upon any services used in South Dakota but performed entirely outside South Dakota and charging the sales tax upon taxable services which are performed wholly or partially within South Dakota. See W. Wireless Corp. v. Dept. of Rev., 665 N.W.2d 73 (S.D. 2003) cert. denied, W. Wireless Corp. v. South Dakota Dept. of Rev., 540 U.S. 1074 (2003) where the South Dakota Supreme Court concluded that receipts for billing services provided for a wireless company operating in the state could be sourced to the state for use tax purposes even though the services themselves were provided by personnel located outside South Dakota. Personal care services, including any service performed on the physical human body (e.g., haircut, massage), are taxed where the service is performed, that is, the same location where the purchaser receives the service. Services performed on products, like repair services, are taxed where the product is delivered to the customer. South Dakota Sales and Use Tax Guide—September 2018. S.D. Codified Laws Ann. § 10-46-18.1 provides that to prevent evasion of tax, evidence that a service is used in this state shall be prima facie evidence that the service is subject to tax. S.D. Codified Laws Ann. § 10-46-18.1. Surveying, Construction Management, Architectural and Engineering Services Surveying services are subject to sales tax where the property surveyed is located. Construction management services are subject to sales tax where the project managed is located. South Dakota Tax Facts — Architects, Engineers and Surveyors. For architectural and engineering services, if the client receives the service at the architect or engineer's office, the service is sourced to the architect or engineer's office location. If the client does not receive the service at the architect or engineer's office, the service is sourced to the customer's address. If the bill to the client contains charges for multiple services, not all of which were received at the architect or engineer's office, then the entire bill is taxed based upon the client's address. South Dakota Tax Facts — Architects, Engineers and Surveyors. Telecommunications Services A sale of telecommunications service sold on a basis other than a call-by-call basis is sourced to the customer's place of primary use. S.D. Admin. R. 64:06:02:91.

S.D. Admin. R. 64:06:02:91. “Call-by-call” basis means any method of charging for telecommunications services where the price is measured by individual calls. S.D. Admin. R. 64:06:02:90(3). “Place of primary use” means the street address representative of where the customer's use of the telecommunications service primarily occurs, which must be the residential street address or the primary business street address of the customer.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Credit for Tax Paid to Another Jurisdiction

Yes South Dakota allows a reciprocal use tax credit up to the amount of any sales or use tax paid to another state. S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §10-46-6.1; Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Taxability Matrix, South Dakota (version 2018.0). The amount of use tax owed to South Dakota is reduced by the amount of any sales or use tax paid by the taxpayer with respect to the property to another state or its political subdivisions. S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §10-46-6.1; Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Taxability Matrix, South Dakota (version 2018.0); South Dakota Dept. of Rev., Are Your Online Purchases Subject to Use Tax? (where lower sales tax is paid to another state than would have been paid in South Dakota, use tax is owed on the difference). However, no credit is available unless the state in which the tax was paid provides a reciprocal credit for taxes paid on similar tangible personal property or any product transferred electronically. S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §10-46-6.1. BNA-SUTN SD 4.2.
