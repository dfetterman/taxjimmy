Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Aircraft, Intrastate or Non-Commercial Use Purchase, Lease, or Rental Transactions

Taxable Aircraft purchased for intrastate use within California by a purchaser other than a common carrier are subject to California's sales and use tax. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6051; California Tax Publication 79A; see California Sales and Use Tax Audit Manual, Chapter 6. California defines aircraft as “any contrivance designed for powered navigation in the air except a rocket or missile.” Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1593(a)(1). Temporary Presence in State A rebuttable presumption exists that any aircraft bought outside California and brought into the state within 12 months from the date of purchase was acquired for storage, use, or other consumption within the state and is subject to tax provided certain qualifications occur. For an aircraft, the presumption will exist if the aircraft was subject to property tax in California during the first 12 months of ownership or purchased by a nonresident and used or stored in the state more than one-half of the time during the first 12 months of ownership. Presumption may be rebutted by documentary evidence that the aircraft was brought into the state exclusively for repair service and used or stored in the state for that purpose for 30 days or less. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6248(a); California Tax Publication 79A. California exempts certain items of tangible personal property purchased for use out of state.

Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Motor Vehicles, Intrastate or Non-Commercial Use Purchase, Lease, or Rental Transactions

Taxable The sale or lease of motor vehicles is generally subject to California's sales and use tax. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6051; California Tax Publication 452; see California Sales and Use Tax Audit Manual, Chapter 6. California defines a vehicle as “any device by which any person or property may be propelled, moved or drawn upon a highway, excepting a device moved by human power or used exclusively upon stationary rails or tracks and excepting a device that is not required to be registered under the Vehicle Code. The term “vehicle” does not include a mobile home or commercial coach required to be registered under the Health and Safety Code, but does include trailer coaches which are required to be registered with the Department of Motor Vehicles. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1610(1); California Tax Publication 34 (addressing sales by motor vehicle dealers); California Tax Publication 46 (addressing leases of tangible personal property generally); California Tax Publication 52 (addressing use tax on vehicles and vessels). Leased Vehicles The general rules regarding the application of tax to leases apply to vehicle leases. However, in order for tax to be reported based on rental receipts (or on fair rental value, in the case of mobile transportation equipment), leased vehicles must be registered in the name of the lessor or in the name of the lessor and lessee jointly. If vehicles are registered in the name of the lessee only, tax liability may not be measured by rental receipts. The transaction will be regarded as a retail sale subject to tax. California Tax Publication 46; California Tax Publication 34; California Tax Publication 452. Miscellaneous Charges Associated With Motor Vehicle Leases Some of the charges made by the dealer which are subject to tax are capitalized reduction costs, document preparation charges, bank fees, acquisition fees, and booking fees. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1660(c)(1); California Tax Publication 46; California Tax Publication 34. At the close of the lease, tax applies to charges such as renegotiation fees, assumption fees, deferral fees, and excessive wear and use charges (for instance, as excessive mileage fees). Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1660(c)(1); California Tax Publication 46; California Tax Publication 34. Refundable security deposits are not taxable when received by the dealer at the inception of the lease. California Tax Publication 46; California Tax Publication 34. Title and registration fees are also specifically excluded from tax. While charges for late payments of the lease are not subject to tax, charges for failing to return the vehicle timely are subject to tax as this is a legitimate charge for the use of the vehicle. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1660(c)(1)(E); California Tax Publication 34. Mobile Transportation Equipment Lessors of mobile transportation equipment have the option of paying tax based on the fair rental value of the equipment, or of paying sales or use tax on the purchase price of the equipment. The payment option chosen is irrevocable. California Tax Publication 34. “Mobile transportation equipment”includes equipment for use in transporting persons or property for substantial distances. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1661(a)(1). The following are classified as mobile transportation equipment:• trucks, truck tractors, and truck trailers; • pickup trucks, including smaller pickups; • buses; • vehicles designed for carrying more than ten people including the driver; • panel trucks designed primarily for carrying property; • vans equipped with a front seat only and designed primarily for carrying property; • hearses; • bogies, chassis, and dollies; and • tangible personal property that is or becomes a component of mobile transportation equipment. California Tax Publication 34. Credit for Tax Paid in Another Jurisdiction California allows a reciprocal use tax credit up to, but not exceeding, the amount of any sales or use tax paid to another state before the use, storage, or consumption of the property in California. In addition to state taxes paid, California allows a taxpayer to take a credit against California state taxes due for local taxes paid as well as taxes paid to the District of Columbia. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6406; California Tax Publication 53A. A credit is also available for tax paid “up front” in another jurisdiction. An “up-front tax” is measured by the total dollar amount of all the payments due under the lease and is imposed at lease inception. For “up-front leases,” a credit is available to the lessee to the extent that the lessee paid tax directly to the lease state or paid a separately stated and identified amount of “tax” or “tax reimbursement” to the lessor for the lease payments that are subsequently subject to use tax in California. The lessee's credit will not exceed the amount of tax actually imposed on the lessee's lease payments. The credit is also available to a lessee if the lease state imposed tax on the individual payments as they became due. California Sales and Use Tax Annotation, 570.1659 Credit for Tax Imposed by Other Jurisdictions. To claim the credit, a taxpayer must prove:• the lease state's tax was actually imposed on the lease transaction at issue between the lessor and the lessee; • the lessee directly paid the amount for which credit is claimed to the lease state or paid to the lessor an agreed upon and separately stated amount for that tax or tax reimbursement; and • the lease state's tax for which a credit is claimed was actually imposed on the same lease payments that are subject to California use tax. California Sales and Use Tax Annotation, 570.1659 Credit for Tax Imposed by Other Jurisdictions. Sales of Previously Leased or Rented Vehicles When previously leased or rented vehicles are sold, tax applies to the total selling price, regardless of tax that may have been previously paid on the lease or rental receipts. California Tax Publication 34. Transfer of a Vehicle to a Lessee by a Lessor as a Sale for Resale The sale of a vehicle to a lessee by a lessor may be considered a nontaxable sale for resale. To be considered a non-taxable sale for resale, the lessee must transfer title and registration to a third party within 10 days from the date the lessee acquires title from the lessor at the expiration or termination of a lease. Transfer of title and registration occurs when the lessee endorses the certificate of ownership. California Tax Publication 34. Company Vehicles and Demonstrators Tax applies to the sale of company cars, parts and service department vehicles, tow trucks, demonstrators, and so forth, in the same manner as it applies to other vehicle sales. Vehicles used solely for demonstration and held for resale or leases are not subject to tax until they are sold. If such vehicles are used for any purpose other than demonstration they will be subject to use tax. California Tax Publication 34. Vehicles Purchased for Use Outside California Vehicles purchased in California and delivered for use outside California are not subject to tax. However, evidence must establish that the vehicle was delivered to the purchaser outside California and that the purchaser did not take possession of the vehicle in the state. California Tax Publication 34; California Tax Publication 53A. Repossessed Vehicles The sale of a repossessed vehicle is taxed the same as any other taxable retail sale. California Tax Publication 34. Vehicles Purchased for Out-of-State Use and Brought Into California for Warranty or Repair Service On or after Oct. 1, 2008, California law provides a use tax exclusion for vehicles purchased outside California and brought into this state for the exclusive purpose of warranty or repair work for no more than 30 days. The 30-day period includes any travel time to and from the repair facility. California Tax Publication 34. Vehicles Purchased by Members of the Armed Services Vehicles purchased out-of-state by a member of the armed services on active duty and delivered to the service member out-of-state are not subject to sales tax if the purchase is made before the effective date of discharge from the service and the service member's intention to use the vehicle in California results from official transfer orders to California and not from the service member's own independent determination. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1610(b)(2)(B); California Tax Publication 34. The service member will be found to have made an independent determination to use the vehicle in California if the contract is made to purchase the vehicle after the service member receives official transfer orders to California or if at the time the contract to purchase the vehicle is made the service member arranges to take receipt of the vehicle in California. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1610(b)(2)(B); California Tax Publication 34. Vehicles Purchased by Residents of a Foreign Country New, noncommercial vehicles manufactured in the United States and purchased by a resident of a foreign country are not subject to sales or use tax, provided the following are true:• the foreign resident must have arranged for the purchase through an authorized dealer in the foreign country before coming to the U.S.; • the foreign resident must obtain an in-transit permit from the DMV; and • prior to the expiration of the in-transit permit, the retailer must ship or deliver the vehicle to a point outside the U.S. by means of: • the retailer's own facilities (e.g., having an employee drive the vehicle to the destination); or • a carrier, forwarding agent, export packer, customs broker, or other person engaged in the business of preparing or arranging property for export. California Tax Publication 34. In order to support the exemption, the retailer must retain evidence to support the claim, such as:• bills of lading; • import documents; • employee expense claims; or • fuel purchase receipts and motel receipts. California Tax Publication 34. If there is not sufficient evidence that the vehicle was delivered outside the U.S. before the in-transit permit expired, the retailer will be liable for sales tax on the vehicles, and any applicable fees and penalties. California Tax Publication 34. Vehicles Modified for Handicapped Persons When a vehicle is modified for the benefit of a handicapped individual, the gross receipts of the sale of materials used for the modification is exempt from the sales and use tax. If a previously modified vehicle is resold to a disabled person who qualifies for a distinguishing license plate or placard, then the sale of the portion of the vehicle which has been modified is exempt. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6369.4; see California Tax Publication 34 (discussing sales of vehicles to disabled veterans); California Tax Publication 61; see also California Sales and Use Tax Audit Manual, Chapter 6.

Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Motor Vehicles, Intrastate or Non-Commercial Use Repair and Replacement Parts

Taxable Motor vehicle repair and replacement parts are subject to California's sales and use tax as tangible personal property. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6051; California Tax Publication 25; California Tax Publication 34. Repair and maintenance parts include spark plugs, belts, tires, batteries, PCV valves, and brake shoes or pads. Replacement parts include engines, transmissions, alternators, water pumps, fenders, and bumpers. California Tax Publication 25. If maintenance services are billed as a lump-sum charge, the service provider is considered the consumer of the parts or materials used in the service when the fair selling price of materials constitutes 10 percent or less of the total charge. The service provider is liable for tax on the materials and may not charge such tax to the customer. If the fair selling price of the materials constitutes more than 10 percent of the lump-sum charge, the service providers must collect sales tax on the fair selling price from the customer. California Tax Publication 25; California Tax Publication 34. Motor Vehicle Core Charges If a sale of new or used vehicle parts includes a core charge, then the core charge is taxable. The core charge is an amount added to a part's price that is refunded to a customer who exchanges an old part for the new part. California Tax Publication 25. On sales of reconditioned or rebuilt parts, sales tax applies to the exchange price. The exchange price is the total selling price of the part, including any core charge, less any credit given to the customer for the trade in. If a core charge is refunded to the customer after the original sale, any tax collected on the core charge should also be refunded. California Tax Publication 25. The application of tax to charges for reconditioning or rebuilding a part will depend on whether the seller:• returns to the customer the same part brought in for repair; or • substitutes a different part. California Tax Publication 25. Warranties Charges for mandatory factory warranties are subject to tax, whether or not the charges are separately stated on the invoice. Tax does not apply to charges for repair parts provided under a mandatory warranty. Charges for optional warranties are not subject to tax. The repairer/retailer is considered the consumer of the repair parts provided under an optional warranty and owes use tax. If the customer is required to pay a deductible under either an optional or mandatory warranty, the dealer/repairer must pay sales tax on a portion of the cost. California Tax Publication 119 (describing the calculation method). BNA-SUTN CA 29.3.2.

Taxable Motor vehicle repair and replacement parts are subject to California's sales and use tax as tangible personal property. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6051; California Tax Publication 25; see California Tax Publication 34. Repair and maintenance parts include spark plugs, belts, tires, batteries, PCV valves, and brake shoes or pads. Replacement parts include engines, transmissions, alternators, water pumps, fenders, and bumpers. California Tax Publication 25. If maintenance services are billed as a lump-sum charge, the service provider is considered the consumer of the parts or materials used in the service when the fair selling price of materials constitutes 10 percent or less of the total charge. The service provider is liable for tax on the materials and may not charge such tax to the customer. If the fair selling price of the materials constitutes more than 10 percent of the lump-sum charge, the service providers must collect sales tax on the fair selling price from the customer. California Tax Publication 25. Motor Vehicle Core Charges If a sale of new or used vehicle parts includes a core charge, then the core charge is taxable. The core charge is an amount added to a part's price that is refunded to a customer who exchanges an old part for the new part. California Tax Publication 25. On sales of reconditioned or rebuilt parts, sales tax applies to the exchange price. The exchange price is the total selling price of the part, including any core charge, less any credit given to the customer for the trade in. If a core charge is refunded to the customer after the original sale, any tax collected on the core charge should also be refunded. California Tax Publication 25. The application of tax to charges for reconditioning or rebuilding a part will depend on whether the seller:• returns to the customer the same part brought in for repair; or • substitutes a different part. California Tax Publication 25. Warranties Charges for mandatory factory warranties are subject to tax, whether or not the charges are separately stated on the invoice. Tax does not apply to charges for repair parts provided under a mandatory warranty. Charges for optional warranties are not subject to tax. The repairer/retailer is considered the consumer of the repair parts provided under an optional warranty and owes use tax. If the customer is required to pay a deductible under either an optional or mandatory warranty, the dealer/repairer must pay sales tax on a portion of the cost. California Tax Publication 119 (describing the calculation method). BNA-SUTN CA 29.4.2.

Depends California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority The California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority (CAEATFA) excludes purchases of tangible personal property from sales tax depending on the use of the personal property. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6010.8, as amended by 2018 Cal. A.B. 1547, effective Sept. 21, 2018; Cal. Public Resources Code § 26011.8(a); see California Legislative Analysts Office, Evaluation of a Sales Tax Exemption For Certain Manufacturers. Effective Sept. 21, 2018, the exclusion extends to purchases by contractors of property for use as an integral party of an approved project. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6010.8, as amended by 2018 Cal. A.B. 1547, effective Sept. 21, 2018. Only property that is considered a “project” qualifies for the exclusion. A “project”consists of tangible personal property used within California for the design, manufacture, production, or assembly of advanced transportation technology products, components, or systems. Cal. Public Resources Code § 26011.8(b)(1); California Tax Publication 542—Edition 4; Cal Dept. of Tax & Fee Admin., CAEATFA Sales and Use Exclusion. “Advanced transportation technologies”are emerging, commercially-competitive transportation-related technologies identified by CAEATFA as capable of creating long-term, high value-added jobs for Californians while enhancing California's commitment to energy conservation, pollution, greenhouse gas emissions reduction, and transportation efficiency. Cal. Public Resources Code § 26003(a)(2)(A). Projects required to be undertaken under state or federal law or regulations, air district rules or regulations, memoranda of understanding with a governmental entity, or legally binding agreements or documents are not qualifying advanced transportation technology projects. Cal. Public Resources Code § 26003(a)(2)(B). Applications Entities who wish to participate in the program must apply to CAEATFA. In order to qualify for the exclusion, the proposed project must provide both fiscal and environmental benefits to California. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6010.8, as amended by 2018 Cal. A.B. 1547, effective Sept. 21, 2018 (amendment extending exclusion to contractors); California Tax Publication 542—Edition 4; see California Legislative Analysts Office, Evaluation of a Sales Tax Exemption For Certain Manufacturers. Applications are evaluated based on the following factors:• the extent to which the project develops manufacturing facilities or purchases equipment for manufacturing facilities located within California; Cal. Public Resources Code § 26011.8(d)(1). • the difference between the anticipated benefit to California and the projected benefit to the applicant from the sales and use tax exclusion; Cal. Public Resources Code § 26011.8(d)(2). • whether the project will create new, permanent jobs in California, and, if so, the projected number of new, permanent jobs that will be created; Cal. Public Resources Code § 26011.8(d)(3). • the extent to which the project results in: ○ a reduction of greenhouse gases; Cal. Public Resources Code § 26011.8(d)(4). ○ a reduction in air pollution; Cal. Public Resources Code § 26011.8(d)(4). ○ a reduction in water pollution; Cal. Public Resources Code § 26011.8(d)(4). ○ an increase in energy efficiency; Cal. Public Resources Code § 26011.8(d)(4). or ○ a reduction in energy consumption; Cal. Public Resources Code § 26011.8(d)(4). • the level of unemployment in the proposed location for the project; Cal. Public Resources Code § 26011.8(d)(5). and • any other factor the CAEATFA deems appropriate. Cal. Public Resources Code § 26011.8(d)(6). Contractors Effective Sept. 21, 2018, the exclusion extends to purchases by contractors of property for use as an integral party of an approved project. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6010.8, as amended by 2018 Cal. A.B. 1547, effective Sept. 21, 2018. Prior to Sept. 21, 2018, the exclusion from sales and use tax only applied to tangible personal property transferred to the participating party. Contractors could not issue exemption certificates claiming the advanced manufacturing exclusion. In order to utilize the exclusion, a construction contract for the furnishing and installation of materials must be structured so that title of the materials passes directly to the participating party before any taxable use occurs. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6010.8, as amended by 2018 Cal. A.B. 1547, effective Sept. 21, 2018; Cal Dept. of Tax & Fee Admin., CAEATFA Sales and Use Exclusion; see Cal. Public Resources Code § 26011.8(a); California Tax Publication 542—Edition 4. Prior to Sept. 21, 2018, contracts should be written to sell the materials used and to install the materials sold and should separately state the sales price of the materials from the charges for labor and installation. This requires:• the contractor to be in the business of selling materials or other tangible personal property; • the contract to possess a valid seller's permit; • the contract to explicitly provide for the transfer of title to the materials prior to installation; and • the contract to separately state the price of materials from the charges for labor and installation. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6010.8, as amended by 2018 Cal. A.B. 1547, effective Sept. 21, 2018; Cal Dept. of Tax & Fee Admin., CAEATFA Sales and Use Exclusion; see Cal. Public Resources Code § 26011.8(a); California Tax Publication 542—Edition 4. Prior to Sept. 21, 2018, if the requirements were met, the contractor may purchase the materials as tax-exempt items for resale. The participating party may then issue an exemption certificate claiming the exclusion for alternative energy sources. Otherwise, the contractor must pay tax on the purchases of materials for a qualifying advanced manufacturing project. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6010.8, as amended by 2018 Cal. A.B. 1547, effective Sept. 21, 2018; Cal Dept. of Tax & Fee Admin., CAEATFA Sales and Use Exclusion; see Cal. Public Resources Code § 26011.8(a); California Tax Publication 542—Edition 4.
