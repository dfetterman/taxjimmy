Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Services

Point of Sale There is no general sourcing rule for sales of services because generally, receipts from the sale of services are not subject to the South Carolina sales and use taxes. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-910; 117 S.C. Code Regs. §303; 117 S.C. Code Regs. §308; 117 S.C. Code Regs. §309. However, with respect to sales of services that are specifically subject to tax in South Carolina, such as sales of accommodation services and communication services, the accommodation services are sourced to the location of the point of sale and the telecommunication services are sourced as provided below. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-910; 117 S.C. Code Regs. §303; 117 S.C. Code Regs. §308; 117 S.C. Code Regs. §309. Otherwise, there are no specific provisions relating to sourcing of sales of services that are performed at another location. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-910; 117 S.C. Code Regs. §303; 117 S.C. Code Regs. §308; 117 S.C. Code Regs. §309. Sourcing Rules for Sales of Telecommunications Services The general rule for sales of telecommunications services, except as otherwise specifically provided, is that telecommunications services that are sold on a call-by-call basis are sourced to each level of taxing jurisdiction where the call originates and terminates in that jurisdiction; or to each level of taxing jurisdiction where the call either originates or terminates and in which the service address is also located. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1920(1). Telecommunications services that are sold on a basis other than call-by-call are sourced to the customer's place of primary use. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1920(2). A customer's place of primary use means the street address that is representative of the customer's primary use of the telecommunications service, but must be the residential street address or the primary business street address of the customer. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1910(9). Charges for prepaid wireless calling arrangements are sourced to the location in South Carolina where the over-the-counter sale took place, the shipping address if the sale did not take place at the seller's location and the item is shipped, or either the billing address or location associated with the mobile telephone number if the sale did not take place at the seller's location and no item is shipped. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-910(B)(5)(b); S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1310(B)(5)(b). Sales of post-paid calling service are sourced to the origination point of the telecommunications signal as first identified by either the seller's telecommunications system, or information received by the seller from its service provider where the system used to transport the signals is not that of the seller. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1920(3)(b). Sales of private communication services are sourced in the following manner:• Services for a separate charge related to a customer channel termination point are sourced to each level of taxing jurisdiction in which the customer channel termination points are located. • Services in which all customer termination points are located entirely within one jurisdiction or levels of jurisdiction are sourced in the jurisdiction in which the customer channel termination points are located. • Services for segments of a channel between two customer channel termination points that are located in different jurisdictions and the segments of channel are separately charged are sourced 50 percent in each level of jurisdiction in which the customer channel termination points are located. • Services for segments of a channel located in more than one jurisdiction or levels of jurisdiction when the segments are not separately billed are sourced in each jurisdiction based on the percentage as determined by dividing the number of customer channel termination points in the jurisdiction by the total number of customer channel termination points. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1920(3)(c). Sourcing Rule for Sales of Mobile Telecommunications Services Charges for sales of mobile telecommunications services must be sourced in accordance with the federal Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-910(B)(3)(a); S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1310(B)(3)(a). In compliance with this Act, sales of mobile telecommunications services, other than air-to-ground radiotelegraphic service and prepaid calling services are sourced to the customer's place of primary use. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1920(3)(a). With respect to mobile telecommunications services, a customer's place of primary use means the street address that is representative of the customer's primary use of the telecommunications service, but must be the residential street address or the primary business street address of the customer, and must be within the licensed service area of the home service provider. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1910(9). BNA-SUTN SC 4.1.2.
