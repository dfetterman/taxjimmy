Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

Depends The Iowa Department of Revenue applies the “incidental test”when a transaction involves the transfer of tangible personal property along with an exempt service. Iowa Revenue Policy Letter No. 06300034 (May 17, 2006). See Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-18.34 When the taxable portion is merely incidental to the exempt element of a transaction, the entire transaction is exempt. “Incidental” is interpreted to mean a value of less than 10 percent of the transaction. Iowa Revenue Policy Letter No. 06300034 (May 17, 2006). Iowa applies the predominant service test when a transaction is for a lump sum and the transaction includes both taxable and nontaxable services. If the predominant service being performed is taxable, then the entire fee is subject to sales tax. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-26.1; Iowa Movers & Warehousemen's Ass'n v. Briggs, 237 N.W.2d 759 (1976). BNA-SUTN IA 9.3.1.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Bundled Transactions

Taxable A tax of 6 percent is imposed on the sales price of bundled transactions. Iowa Code Ann. §423.2(8)(a). A “bundled transaction”means the retail sale of two or more distinct and identifiable products, except real property and services to real property that are sold for one non-itemized price. Iowa Code Ann. §423.2(8)(a); Iowa Declaratory Order Docket No. 2017-240-2-0000 (Jan. 4, 2017) (a charge for a membership with a taxable component that is not itemized among its various components causes the membership to become a taxable bundled transaction). Bundled transactions do not include the sale of any products when the sales price varies, or is negotiable, based on the selection by the purchaser of the products included in the transaction. Iowa Code Ann. §423.2(8)(a). “Distinct and identifiable products”do not include any of the following: • packaging or other materials that accompany the retail sale of the products and are incidental or immaterial to the retail sale of the products; Iowa Code Ann. §423.2(8)(b)(1). • a product provided free of charge with the required purchase of another product. A product is “provided free of charge” if the sales price of the product purchased does not vary depending on the inclusion of the product that is provided free of charge; Iowa Code Ann. §423.2(8)(b)(2). and • items included in the definition of “sales price.” Iowa Code Ann. §423.2(8)(b)(3). “One non-itemized price” does not include a price that is separately identified by product on binding sales or other supporting sales-related documentation made available to the customer. Iowa Code Ann. §423.2(8)(c). Effective July 1, 2018, a transaction that otherwise meets the definition of “bundled transaction” is not a bundled transaction if it is any of the following:• the retail sale of tangible personal property and a service where the tangible personal property is essential to the use of the service, and is provided exclusively in connection with the service, and the true object of the transaction is the service; • the retail sale of services where one service is provided that is essential to the use or receipt of a second service and the first service is provided exclusively in connection with the second service and the true object of the transaction is the second service; • a transaction that includes taxable products and nontaxable products and the purchase price or sales price of the taxable products is de minimis, which it will be deemed to be if the seller's purchase or sales price of the taxable products is ten percent or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled products; or • the retail sale of exempt tangible personal property and taxable tangible personal property where both of the following apply: o the transaction includes food and food ingredients, drugs, durable medical equipment, mobility enhancing equipment, prosthetic devices, or medical supplies; and o the seller's purchase price or sales price of the taxable tangible personal property is fifty percent or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled tangible personal property. Iowa Code Ann. §423.2(8)(d), as amended by 2018 Iowa S.F. 2417, §171, effective July 1, 2018. Where the price for one of two distinct items that are sold together is discernible for any purchaser by finding the same or similar item for sale by a retailer, the transaction is not a bundled transaction. Iowa Declaratory Order Docket No. 2018-300-2-0440 (Dec. 7, 2018). Telecommunications Transactions Although Iowa has not enacted specific legislation regarding bundled telecommunications transactions, it did enact a statute that granted authority for the tax director to enter into various agreements, including tax bundling agreements. Iowa Code Ann. §423.8. Iowa Code Ann. § 423.23 states that agreements between competing sellers, or the adoption of appropriate rules and regulations by organizations or associations of sellers to provide uniform methods for adding sales or use tax or the average equivalent thereof, and which do not involve price-fixing agreements otherwise unlawful, are expressly authorized and will be held not to violate the laws of this state. Iowa Code Ann. § 423.23. BNA-SUTN IA 9.3.2.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Local Jurisdictions, Taxability Distinctions

Conforms to State Iowa authorizes counties to impose a sales and use tax of not more than 1 percent on the same basis as the state sales and use tax. Iowa Code Ann. § 422B.8. Sales and services not subject to the state sales and use tax may not be taxed by a county. If a county elects to impose a sales tax, a local excise tax at the same rate must be imposed by the county on the purchase price of natural gas, natural gas service, electricity, and electricity service. Iowa Code Ann. § 422B.8. The county sales tax is applicable to transactions within incorporated and unincorporated areas in the county. All cities contiguous to each other shall be treated as part of one incorporated area and the tax is imposed in these cities by the county in which the majority of those voting in the total area of the contiguous cities favors its imposition. Iowa Code Ann. § 422B.8. BNA-SUTN IA 9.4.
