Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal General Rule for Classification

Depends Tennessee imposes the sales and use tax on the retail sale, use, storage, or consumption of tangible personal property, not real property. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-202(a) as amended by 2019 Tenn. H.B. 931, effective April 12, 2019 (extending Tennessee's compliance with SSUTA until July 1, 2021); Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-203(a) as amended by 2019 Tenn. H.B. 931, effective April 12, 2019 (extending Tennessee's compliance with SSUTA until July 1, 2021). If an item of tangible personal property becomes permanently affixed to real property, then it is treated as real property and statutory exemptions pertaining to real property apply. Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. §1320-5-1-.27(4) effective, beginning September 26, 2016 (Charges made for installing tangible personal property which becomes a part of real property, are not subject to sales and use tax); Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. §1320-5-1-.54(2) (taxable repair services do not include repairs to fixtures attached to real property). On the other hand, tangible personal property that is sold and attached to real property, but is ordinarily removed by the owner or tenant, such as window air conditioning units, curtain and drapery rods, etc. are deemed personal property and are taxable. Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. §1320-5-1-.27(2); Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. §1320-5-1-.27(3) effective, beginning September 26, 2016. Tennessee will consider an item of tangible personal property to become a part of real property to which it is affixed, if it is intended by the parties involved to remain permanently affixed. Magnavox Consumer Elects. v. King, 707 S.W.2d 504 (Tenn. 1986); Gen. Carpet Contractors, Inc. v. Tidwell 511 S.W.2d 241 (Tenn. 1974); Hickman v. Booth, 173 S.W. 438 (Tenn. 1914). Both objective evidence of the parties'intent and the parties' expressed intent, if any, will be considered in making this determination. Hubbard v. Hardeman County Bank, 868 S.W.2d 656 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1993). Objective factors that may be considered include the type of structure involved, the use to which the property is put, and the method of affixation. Harry J. Whelchel Co. v. King, 610 S.W.2d 710 (Tenn. 1980). For instance, if an affixed item cannot be removed without substantially damaging it or the real property to which it is affixed, then this will favor a finding that it has become a part of the real property. Green v. Harper, 700 S.W.2d 565 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1985); Memphis Hous. Auth. v. Memphis Steam Laundry-Cleaners, Inc. 463 S.W.2d 677 (Tenn. 1971). Even if such objective factors favor characterizing an item as real property, a contrary expressed intent of the parties may in some instances cause the item to be deemed to retain its character as tangible personal property. See Hubbard v. Hardeman County Bank, 868 S.W.2d 656 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1993) (leased bank branch buildings retained their character as tangible personal property where they were constructed to be portable and the leases provided that the buildings were not to become fixtures). When property is installed upon real property pursuant to a non-ownership interest in the real property, such as a lease or easement, the key question is whether the parties intend that the owner of the property being installed has the ability to remove the property from the land. Tennessee Letter Ruling No. 17-09 (June 21, 2017). Effective July 1, 2019, Tennessee deems fiber-optic cable to be realty after it is attached to a utility pole, building, or other structure or is installed underground. Tenn.

Depends Tennessee's sales and use tax treatment of construction services and tangible personal property used in rendering these services varies depending on whether the contractor is treated as a retailer or a consumer. Tennessee Sales and Use Tax Guide—September 2018; Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. §1320-5-1-.08. Contractor-Retailers Contractors also engaged in the business of selling building materials and supplies are entitled to purchase all of their materials and supplies using a resale certificate, thus making the transaction exempt from tax. Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. §1320-5-1-.08(1). When a contractor-retailer sells tangible personal property, the contractor must collect, report, and remit sales tax to the state. Likewise, if a contractor uses supplies or materials purchased with a resale certificate in completing a construction contract, the contractor has made a withdrawal from inventory and is responsible for paying the appropriate use tax due to the state. Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. §1320-5-1-.08(2). Contractor-Consumer Contractors engaged in constructing or improving real property, whether on a lump sum or a cost-plus basis, are purchasers and consumers of the materials they use, and are required to pay the sales and use tax on such materials or equipment purchased for use in connection with their contracts. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-209(a); Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-541(a); Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. §1320-5-1-.07(1). BNA-SUTN TN 28.5.

Church Construction When a church purchases the supplies and materials to be used in erecting a church building that is exempt from tax, the contractor's use of these materials and supplies does not create a use tax obligation for the contractor.

R. & Regs. §1320-5-1-.101. Materials Used in or as Part of Electric Generating Plants Materials and equipment purchased or used by a contractor or subcontractor for the construction of or installation in an electric generating plant or distribution system owned or operated by the United States or any of its agencies, by the state of Tennessee, or any of its political subdivisions, or any electric membership corporation or electric cooperative organized pursuant to Tennessee law, are exempt from sales and use tax provided the materials and equipment become a component part of the plant or distribution system. Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. §1320-5-1-.102(1); Tennessee Letter Ruling No. 13-17 (Nov. 19, 2013). The exemption does not apply to tangible personal property or taxable service used in the process of installing the exempt property, when the tangible personal property does not become a component part of the electric generating plant or distribution system. Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. §1320-5-1-.102(1). Contractors and sub-contractors purchasing tangible personal property to be used as a component part of an electric generating plant or distribution system may furnish their supplier an exemption certificate for each purchase in lieu of the sales or use tax.

Additionally, vendors must include in their subcontracts a provision that requires subcontractors to remit sales and use taxes on their taxable sales of goods or services. See Tenn.
