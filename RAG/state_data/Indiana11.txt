Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Use' or 'Storage, Use, or Consumption'

Defined “Use”means the exercise of any right or power of ownership over tangible personal property. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-3-1(a); Asplundh Tree Expert Co. v. Indiana Dept. of Rev., 38 N.E.3d 744, 2015 BL 212241 (Ind. Tax Ct. 2015). “Storage” means the keeping or retention of tangible personal property in Indiana for any purpose except temporary storage. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-3-1(b), as amended by 2015 Ind. H.B. 1472, §6, effective Jan. 1, 2016. Prior to Jan. 1, 2016, “storage”was defined as the keeping or retention of tangible personal property for any purpose except “the subsequent use of that property solely outside Indiana.” No mention of “temporary storage”was made prior to Jan. 1, 2016. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-3-1(b) (2015); see Zimmer, Inc. v. Indiana Dept. of Rev., 72 N.E.3d 1031, 2017 BL 121635 (Ind. Tax Ct. 2017) (interpreting the phrase “solely outside Indiana”). “Temporary storage”means the keeping or retention of tangible personal property in Indiana for a period of not more than 180 days and only for the purpose of the subsequent use of that property solely outside of Indiana. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-3-1(d), as added by 2015 Ind. H.B. 1472, §6, effective July 1, 2015; Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20130229 (May 28, 2014); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20130230 (May 28, 2014). The Indiana Tax Court has held that use tax does not apply to materials purchased and processed into building components outside the state and used to construct buildings within Indiana. In Morton Buildings Inc. v. Indiana Dept. of Rev., the taxpayer, an Illinois company, sold and erected pre-fabricated buildings for use in Indiana and in other states. The taxpayer purchased raw materials outside of the state and made them into building components at factories located outside the state. When a customer ordered a building, the taxpayer withdrew the necessary raw materials from storage and made them into building components. These materials included lumber, nails, cement, staples, insulation and plastic sheeting. The taxpayer sought a refund on all of the use taxes it paid to Indiana for the cost of the raw materials it used at its factories outside the state to make building components used in Indiana. The taxpayer argued that the raw materials in issue were not “purchased from a retailer”because the building components made out of the raw materials were new and different items of tangible personal property. Morton Bldgs. Inc. v. Indiana Dept. of Rev., 819 N.E.2d 913 (Ind. Tax Ct. 2004). In its analysis, the tax court applied the following test to determine if the imposition of use tax on the raw materials in issue was proper:• whether the item of tangible personal property is used, stored, or consumed in Indiana; and • whether the item of personal property is purchased from a retailer (not manufactured by the user). The tax court held that the manufacturing process that was performed upon the raw materials did transform the raw materials into something that was not purchased from a retailer. As a result, the conversion of raw materials into identifiably distinguishable personal property excludes the raw materials from continued taxability under the use tax. Morton Bldgs. Inc. v. Indiana Dept. of Rev., 819 N.E.2d 913 (Ind. Tax Ct. 2004). BNA-SUTN IN 1.4.3.
