Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2703.01(2). • if a purchaser does not receive taxable property or services at a seller's business location, the sale is sourced to the location where the purchaser receives taxable property or services. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2703.01(3). • if the location of a sale cannot be determined under the above rules, the sale is sourced to the purchaser's address as indicated by the seller's business records. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2703.01(4). • if the location of a sale cannot be sourced under any of the above rules, the sale is sourced to the purchaser's address as obtained during the consummation of the sale, such as the address indicated on the purchaser's payment instrument. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2703.01(5). • if the location of a sale cannot be sourced under any of the above rules, the sale is sourced as follows: o if tangible personal property or other taxable property is sold, the sale of such property is sourced to the location from which the property is shipped; Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2703.01(6). o if a digital good or computer software delivered electronically is sold, the sale is sourced to the location from which the digital good or computer software was first available for transmission by the seller, not including any location that merely provided the digital transfer of the product sold; Nebraska Rev.

Transportation Equipment The retail sale, including lease or rental, of transportation equipment shall be sourced as a retail sale under the above general rules. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2703.01(9). Motor Vehicles Purchased by Public Power Districts For sales on or after Jan. 1, 2021, sales of any motor vehicle or trailer operated by a public power district will be sourced for sales tax purposes at the place where the motor vehicle or trailer is stored and kept for the greater portion of the calendar year. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §13-2816, as amended by 2017 Neb. L.B. 1030, effective Jan. 1, 2021; Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2703.01, as amended by 2017 Neb. L.B. 1030, effective Jan. 1, 2021; Nebraska Dept. of Rev., 2018 Nebraska Legislative Changes.

Direct Mail Sales In the case of direct mail sales, a distinction is made between “advertising and promotional direct mail”and “other direct mail.” Advertising and promotional direct mail is primarily used for attracting attention to or attempting to sell, popularize, or secure financial support for a product, person, business, or organization. Other direct mail is any direct mail that is not advertising and promotional direct mail, regardless of whether advertising and promotional direct mail is included in the same mailing. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2703.03(1). When a purchaser provides the seller with information showing the jurisdictions to which the advertising and promotional direct mail is going to be delivered or provides a direct pay permit, authorized exemption certificate, or written statement claiming the exemption is approved by the Tax Commissioner, the sale is sourced to the location to which the direct mail is delivered. If the purchaser does not provide the seller with such information, the sale is sourced to the place of shipment. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2703.03(2). When a purchaser of other direct mail provides the seller with a direct pay permit, an exemption certificate claiming direct mail, or information indicating the appropriate taxing jurisdiction that is the ultimate destination, the sale is sourced to the location to which the other direct mail is delivered. If the purchaser does not provide the seller with such information, the sale will be sourced to the location indicated by an address (or other information) for the purchaser that is available from the regularly kept business records of the seller. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2703.03(3). BNA-SUTN NE 4.1.1.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Leases and Rentals

Destination Except as provided below for leases and rentals of motor vehicles, trailers, semitrailers, and aircraft not constituting “transportation equipment,” the first payment on the lease or rental of taxable property is sourced to the location determined under the above general rules. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2703.01(7)(a). Subsequent periodic payments on the lease or rental, if any, are sourced to the property's primary location as indicated by an address that is provided by the lessee and that is available in records that the lessor maintains in the ordinary course of business. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2703.01(7)(a).

The primary property location shall be as indicated by an address for the property provided by the lessee that is available to the lessor from its records maintained in the ordinary course of business, when use of this address does not constitute bad faith. This location shall not be altered by intermittent use at different locations; Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2703.01(8)(a). and • for a lease or rental that does not require recurring periodic payments, the payment is sourced the same as a retail sale in accordance with the general sourcing rules above.

Same as State The sales and use taxes apply to all retail transactions consummated within a city, municipality, or county imposing a retail sales tax. The sourcing rules of the state of Nebraska apply for sourcing at the local level. For the purposes of sourcing sales, Nebraska follows destination-based sourcing for general retail sales.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Credit for Tax Paid to Another Jurisdiction

Yes If any person who causes property or services to be brought into Nebraska has already paid tax in another state with respect to the sale or use of that property, in an amount that is equal to or more than Nebraska's sales and use tax, then Nebraska's use tax is not due on the property, if the other state, territory, or possession grants a reciprocal exclusion or exemption to similar transactions in Nebraska. Nebraska Rev. Stat. § 77-2704.31; Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-002. If the amount of tax already paid is less than Nebraska's sales and use tax, then Nebraska use tax applies, but at a rate measured by the difference between the Nebraska use tax rate and the rate by which the previous tax on the sale or use was computed. Nebraska Rev. Stat. § 77-2704.31; Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-071. The credit for tax paid to another state is applied first against the amount of any use tax that is due to Nebraska, and any unused portion of the credit is then applied against the amount of any use tax due to a subdivision. Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-071. While use tax is not due if the amount of tax paid to a foreign state and its subdivisions is equal to or exceeds the use tax imposed by Nebraska and its subdivisions, any excess is not refundable and it may also not be used as a credit against the use tax due on any other property or service. Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-071. Additionally, the credit allowed is limited to a credit for the amount of tax actually paid to a foreign state and its subdivisions; the Nebraska credit does not extend to any credits allowed in the other state, any amount that is refundable by the other state, or the incidence of the tax. Meaning, the use tax due in Nebraska may not be extinguished through a tax exemption afforded on the same transaction by a foreign state. Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-071. BNA-SUTN NE 4.2.

Nontaxable The use tax does not apply to transactions where the item purchased has been used for its intended purpose out-of-state. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2704.44(2); Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-002.04D. In the case of a motor vehicle, semitrailer, trailer, or motorboat, the motor vehicle, semitrailer, trailer, or motorboat must be licensed or registered out-of-state prior to being brought into Nebraska in order for the exemption to apply. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2704.44(2)(b); Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2704.44(2)(d). The exemption does not apply to an aircraft brought into Nebraska within one year of purchase if: (1) the aircraft is regularly based within Nebraska; or (2) more than one half of the aircraft's operating hours are within Nebraska. Hours spent operating the aircraft for the purpose of maintenance, repair, or fabrication with subsequent removal from Nebraska will not be considered operating hours within Nebraska. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2704.44(2)(c). BNA-SUTN NE 4.3.1.

Depends When property is sold in Nebraska and the seller is required as a condition of the sale to deliver the property to a point out-of-state, or to a common or contract carrier for transportation to a point out-of-state, sales tax does not apply, provided that the property is not returned to a point within the state. Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-064.02. However, if property is delivered to a purchaser within the state, sales tax applies, even if the purchaser intends to transport the property out-of-state. Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-064.02. BNA-SUTN NE 4.3.3.
