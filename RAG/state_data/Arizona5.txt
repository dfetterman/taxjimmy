Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Real Property

Defined “Real property” includes any improvements, rights or interest in such property. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5069(F)(3). When an item of tangible personal property is affixed to real property, Arizona uses the reasonable person test to determine whether the item becomes part of the real property. Specifically, Arizona examines whether a reasonable person, after considering all the relevant circumstances, would assume that the item belongs to and is a part of the real property on which it is located. If so, the item is considered part of the real property and referred to as a “fixture.” Arizona previously applied a three-part test to determine the character of an item of tangible personal property affixed to real property, but abandoned this test in favor of the more flexible reasonable person test. Arizona Dept. of Rev. v. Ariz. Outdoor Advertisers, Inc., 41 P.3d 631 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2002). Commercial Lease Classification Although Arizona law imposes a transaction privilege tax under the commercial lease classification on the gross proceeds from leasing real property for commercial purposes, the state rate applied to this classification has been reduced to 0 percent, effectively repealing the tax. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5069(A); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5010(A)(4). However, counties and cities may tax commercial leasing. Accordingly, the Arizona Department of Revenue has issued a bulletin indicating that promoters of special events, such as flea markets, fairs or other transient selling events, who charge vendors for renting space at their events may be subject to a county or city transaction privilege tax under the commercial lease classification. Arizona Information Publication 550. The rental of real property for residential or agricultural purposes is subject to the transaction privilege tax. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5069(A); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5010(A)(4); Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Changes &News April 2017. Owner-Builder Classification Prior to Jan. 1, 2015, tax was imposed under the owner builder classification on persons selling improved real property within 24 months of the real property's improvement being substantially completed. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5010(A)(1)(i); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5076(A); see SDC Mgt., Inc. v. Arizona Dept. of Rev., 808 P.2d 1243 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1991) (holding that taxpayers did not act as contractors and were therefore not considered “owner-builders"for the purposes of the transaction privilege tax). The tax imposed under the owner builder classification was repealed effective December 31, 2014. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5076 repealed by 2013 Ariz. H.B. 2111, effective December 31, 2014.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal General Rule for Classification

No Arizona uses the term “fixture” to refer to items of tangible personal property that lose their identity as tangible personal property when affixed to real property. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5001; Arizona Dept. of Rev. v. Ariz. Outdoor Advertisers, Inc., 41 P.3d 631 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2002). An item of personal property becomes a fixture if a reasonable person, after considering all the relevant circumstances, would assume that the item in question belongs to and is a part of the real estate on which it is located. Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Decision No. 200900009-S (July 26, 2010). The common law of fixtures employs a three-prong test to determine whether tangible personal property becomes a fixture:(1) There must be an annexation to the realty or something appurtenant thereto. Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Decision No. 200900009-S (July 26, 2010). (2) The chattel must have adaptability or application as affixed to the use for which the real estate is appropriated. Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Decision No. 200900009-S (July 26, 2010). (3) There must be an intention of the party to make the chattel a permanent accession to the freehold. Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Decision No. 200900009-S (July 26, 2010). In some states, the sale and installation upon real property of complete items of tangible personal property such as kitchen appliances and electronic equipment, sometimes referred to as “fixtures”, is treated as a taxable sale of tangible personal property the same as if these items were sold uninstalled. In contrast to these states, Arizona uses the term “fixture”to refer to items of tangible personal property that lose their identity as tangible personal property when affixed to real property. See Arizona Dept. of Rev. v. Ariz. Outdoor Advertisers, Inc., 41 P.3d 631 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2002). Occasionally it can be difficult to determine whether a person is a retailer or a contractor. A business may be involved in various activities which fall under one or more transaction privilege tax classifications. In that event, an analysis of the individual activity is required in order to make a determination of the tax status of the transaction. Arizona Private Taxpayer Ruling LR94-021 (Dec. 29, 1994). An example of a contracting activity is the installation of new appliances, wallpaper, and other fixtures. Arizona Private Taxpayer Ruling LR94-021 (Dec. 29, 1994). BNA-SUTN AZ 28.2.1.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Construction Materials and Contracts Construction Materials and Contracts, Generally

Taxable Transaction privilege tax is imposed under the prime contracting classification on 65 percent of the gross proceeds derived from the business of prime contracting or the business of selling and installing manufactured buildings. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5075(A); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5075(B). Effective Jan. 1, 2019, the prime contracting classification does not include any work or operation performed by a person that is not required to be licensed by Arizona's registrar of contractors. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5075(A), as amended by 2018 Ariz. S.B. 1409, effective Jan. 1, 2019. “Prime contracting”means engaging in business as a prime contractor. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5075(R)(9). “Prime contractor”means a contractor who supervises, performs or coordinates the modification of any building, highway, road, railroad, excavation, manufactured building or other structure, project, development or improvement, including the contracting, if any, with any subcontractors or specialty contractors, and who is responsible for the completion of the contract. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5075(R)(10); Arizona Private Taxpayer Ruling LR16-003 (April 18, 2016); Arizona Private Taxpayer Ruling LR15-006 (June 4, 2015); Arizona Publication No. 610. The term “prime contractor” is not synonymous with the term “general contractor” as used in the contracting industry. For transaction privilege tax purposes, the prime contractor need only be responsible for the completion of a contract that requires it to supervise, perform, or coordinate a modification. Additionally, a prime contractor does not have to be responsible for the completion of an entire project, it only has to be responsible for the completion of its own contract. A construction project may have more than one prime contractor and a contractor may be taxable as a prime contractor without being the general contractor on a project. Arizona Taxpayer Information Ruling LR17-002 (Jan. 3, 2017). A contractor or developer who owns real property, engages one or more contractors to modify that real property, and does not itself modify that real property is not treated as a prime contractor regardless of the existence of a contract for sale or the subsequent sale of that real property unless either of the following occurs:• the contractor or developer issues Form 5005 to the other contractors on the project indicating to them that it will be responsible for the transaction privilege tax; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5075(E); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5075(R)(10); Arizona Taxpayer Information Ruling LR17-002 (Jan. 3, 2017). or • the contractor or developer receives consideration for modifications it performs after title passes to the customer. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5075(Q); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5075(R)(10); Arizona Taxpayer Information Ruling LR17-002 (Jan. 3, 2017). Only prime contractors are responsible for the transaction privilege tax, and other contractors on a job are not responsible for the tax and are not subject to the tax, if they can demonstrate a job was in the control of a prime contractor. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5075(D); Arizona Publication No. 603; Arizona Private Taxpayer Ruling LR16-003 (April 18, 2016); Arizona Private Taxpayer Ruling LR15-006 (June 4, 2015). Prior to Jan. 1, 2015, taxable prime contracting activities included the construction, alteration, repair, addition, subtraction, improvement, movement, wreckage, or demolition of any building, highway, road, railroad, excavation, manufactured building, or other structure, project, development, or improvement. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5075(Q)(5), amended by 2014 Ariz. H.B. 2389, effective Jan. 1, 2015; Arizona Private Taxpayer Ruling LR15-006 (June 4, 2015). Effective Jan. 1, 2015, prime contracting no longer includes real property maintenance, repair, replacement, or alteration that is not related to taxable “modification”activities. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5075(O), as amended by 2014 Ariz. H.B. 2389, effective Jan. 1, 2015; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5075(B)(20), as amended by 2014 Ariz. S.B. 1301, effective Jan. 1, 2015; Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Notice 15-1 (Revised June 22, 2016).. Design phase and professional services contractors working as prime contractors are exempt if their contract with the property owner was executed before modifications began and its terms, conditions, and pricing are separately stated from the construction services. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5009 as amended by 2013 Ariz. H.B. 2111, enacted June 25, 2013, effective Dec. 31, 2014. “Modification” taxable under the prime contracting classification includes construction, grading and leveling ground, and wreckage and demolition, other than wreckage or demolition of existing property that is necessary as part of nontaxable real property maintenance, repair, replacement, or alteration. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5075(R)(6), as amended by 2015 Ariz. S.B. 1446, effective Feb. 24, 2015. Taxable modification generally includes landscaping activities, but not lawn maintenance. Examples of nontaxable lawn maintenance include:• lawn mowing and edging; • weeding; • repairing sprinkler heads or drip irrigation heads; • seasonal flower replacement; • refreshing gravel; • lawn dethatching; • seeding winter lawns; • leaf and debris collection and removal; • tree or shrub pruning or clipping; • garden and gravel raking; and • applying pesticides and fertilizers. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5075(I), as amended by 2017 Ariz. S.B. 1058, effective July 21, 2017. Taxable landscaping activities include:• installing lawns; • grading or leveling ground; • installing gravel or boulders; • planting trees and other plants; • felling trees; • removing or mulching tree stumps or other imbedded plants; • building irrigation berms; • installing railroad ties; and • installing underground sprinkler or watering systems. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5075(J), as amended by 2015 Ariz. S.B. 1446, effective Feb. 24, 2015; see KLP Enters., Inc. v. Arizona Dept. of Rev., 2014 BL 292666 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2014) (excavating agricultural fields is taxable as prime contracting activity); Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Decision No. 201300197-S (Dec. 3, 2014)(forest clearing and excavation activities are taxable under the prime contracting classification). The sale and installation of floor covering affixed to real property is subject to tax under the prime contractor classification. Ariz. Admin. Code 15-5-613. In Best Laid Floors LLC v. Department of Revenue, the Arizona State Board of Tax Appeals held that a business engaged in carpet installation was subject to the transaction privilege tax under the prime contractor classification, rather than the retailing classification, which exempts installation charges. Arizona Board of Tax Appeals Decision No. 1869-02-S (March 11, 2003). Tangible personal property sold to a prime contractor or a subcontractor to be incorporated into a project subject to transaction privilege tax under the prime contracting classification may be purchased exempt from Arizona's retail transaction privilege tax and use tax. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5061(A)(27); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5159(A)(13)(g), as amended by 2015 Ariz. S.B. 1446, effective Feb. 24, 2015; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5159(A)(13)(h), as amended by 2015 Ariz. S.B. 1446, effective Feb. 24, 2015. For contracts performed on or after Jan. 1, 2015, a prime contractor or subcontractor that incorporates property for which this exemption was claimed into a nontaxable real property maintenance, repair, replacement, or alteration project must pay tax on the property equal to the retail transaction privilege tax or use tax that would otherwise have been due. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5008.01, as added by 2015 Ariz. S.B. 1446, effective Feb. 24, 2015. The following amounts are deducted when determining the gross proceeds subject to transaction privilege tax under the prime contracting classification:• the sales price of land; • amounts derived from the sale and installation of groundwater measuring devices and groundwater monitoring wells required by law; • the sales price of furniture, furnishings, fixtures, appliances and attachments that are not incorporated as component parts to a manufactured building or the setup site; • gross proceeds from the modification of any building, highway, road, railroad, excavation, manufactured building or other structure in a military reuse zone for aviation or aerospace services or for a manufacturer, assembler or fabricator of aviation or aerospace products in a military reuse zone; • gross proceeds from contracts to construct qualified environmental technology manufacturing, producing, or processing facilities, and subsequent contracts that begin within 10 years after the start of initial construction; • gross proceeds from contracts for site preparation or constructing, furnishing, or installing machinery, equipment or other tangible personal property in response to a release or suspected release into the environment of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant from a facility; • gross proceeds from contracts to install, assemble, repair, or maintain machinery, equipment, or other tangible personal property that is exempt from retail transaction privilege tax and use tax under Arizona's manufacturing exemption if the tangible personal property is capable of performing its function without being attached to real property; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5061(B); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5159(B). • gross proceeds attributable to the purchase of machinery, equipment, or other tangible personal property exempt from tax under Arizona's healthcare facility exemptions, nonprofit organization exemption, or manufacturing exemption; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5061(A)(25); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5159(A)(13); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5061(A)(29); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5159(B); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5061(B). • gross proceeds received from contracts for the construction of environmentally controlled facilities used to raise poultry for the production of eggs and to sort, cool, and package eggs; • gross proceeds from contracts entered into with persons engaged in the commercial production of livestock, livestock products or agricultural, horticultural, viticultural, or floricultural crops or products in Arizona for the modification of a building or structure used directly and primarily to prevent, monitor, control, or reduce pollution; • gross proceeds from the installation, assembly, repair, or maintenance of clean rooms used for manufacturing, processing, fabricating, or research and develop of semiconductor products; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5061(B)(16). • gross proceeds from the construction of residential apartment facilities owned by I.R.C. §501(c)(3) nonprofit charitable organizations that qualify for federal housing subsidies for low income persons over 62 years of age; • through Jan. 1, 2017, gross proceeds from the sale and installation of solar energy devices; • gross proceeds from the construction of launch sites, as defined in 14 C.F.R. §401.5; • gross proceeds from the construction of domestic violence shelters owned and operated by I.R.C. §501(c)(3) nonprofit charitable organizations; • gross proceeds from the performance of post-construction treatment of real property for termite and pest control; • gross proceeds from contracts to construct any structure, project, development, or improvement that is owned by a qualified business to harvest or process qualifying forest products, and on which construction begins prior to Jan. 1, 2024; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §41-1516. • gross proceeds attributable to development fees that are imposed to offset public service costs related to a construction contract and that are paid by a prime contractor or subcontractor; and • gross proceeds derived from contracts to construct mixed waste processing facilities that are located on municipal solid waste landfills and constructed to recycle solid waste or produce renewable energy from landfill waste. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5075(B), as amended by 2015 Ariz. S.B. 1446, effective Feb. 24, 2015. If a taxpayer's business operations combine nontaxable professional services and taxable prime contracting, the issue arises whether the taxpayer's total gross proceeds from business operations should be subject to the transaction privilege tax, or whether the taxpayer may exclude the nontaxable professional services income from the gross proceeds subject to tax. The Arizona Supreme Court has found that, depending on the facts and circumstances of the individual case, the taxpayer's professional services will not be merged for tax purposes into the taxable contracting business if certain requirements are met. Arizona Tax Comn. v. Holmes & Narver, Inc., 548 P.2d 1162 (Ariz. 1976). Generally, these include: • the taxpayer must be able to readily ascertain “without substantial difficulty” which portion of the business relates to nontaxable professional services; • the amounts in relation to the company's total taxable Arizona business are not inconsequential;and • the nontaxable professional services “cannot be said to be identical to the contracting business.” Arizona Tax Comn. v. Holmes & Narver, Inc., 548 P.2d 1162 (Ariz. 1976); see also Ebasco Servs. Inc. v. Arizona Tax Comn., 459 P.2d 719 (Ariz. 1969). MRRA Contracts Arizona taxes construction activities under its transaction privilege tax prime contracting classification. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5075. However, as of Jan. 1, 2015, activities that involve projects for maintenance, repair, replacement or alteration of real property (MRRA) are not subject to transaction privilege tax under the prime contracting or retail classifications, and are not subject to tax when the activities are performed directly for the property owner or an authorized party. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5075; Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Notice 15-1 (June 22, 2015). Contractors are subject to tax on tangible personal property incorporated or fabricated into projects in Arizona involving the MRRA of real property or existing real property improvements provided the contract includes no more than a “de minimis” amount of modification activity. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5075, as amended by 2015 Ariz. S.B. 1446, effective retroactively to Jan. 1, 2015; Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Notice 15-1 (June 22, 2015). Thus contractors may be responsible for paying tax on MRRA project materials, as well as paying tax as a prime contractor on other non-MRRA projects. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5075, as amended by 2015 Ariz. S.B. 1446, retroactively repealed by 2015 Ariz. H.B. 2389 effective Jan. 1, 2015. (all previous guidance, including definitions, relates to Arizona H.B. 2389 and not Arizona S.B. 1446). A modification will be considered “de minimis” if the amount attributable to the modification is 15 percent or less of the total receipts from the total contract. Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Notice 15-1 (June 22, 2015). Unless the modification activity meets the 15% or less de minimis test, the entire MRRA contract is subject to prime contracting TPT. Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Notice 15-1 (June 22, 2015). If the modification is 15% or less of receipts from the total contract, the department will interpret the de minimis modification as being of such an inconsequential nature as to be nontaxable, rendering receipts from the entire contract exempt from prime contracting TPT. Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Notice 15-1 (June 22, 2015). Maintenance is defined as the upkeep of property or equipment. Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Notice 15-1 (June 22, 2015). Examples include, but are not limited to:• annual checkup of HVAC systems; • restaining a wood deck; and • refinishing hardwood floors. Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Notice 15-1 (June 22, 2015). Repair is defined as an activity that returns real property to a usable state. This can include a repair from a partial or complete state of nonfunctionality. Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Notice 15-1 (June 22, 2015). Examples include, but are not limited to:• recharging air-conditioners; • fixing a shower leak; • clearing blocked pipes of debris; • readjusting satellite dishes; and • replacing worn washers in a faucet. Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Notice 15-1 (June 22, 2015). Replacement is defined as the removal of a component or a system of existing property or tangible personal property installed in existing property that provides the same, similar, or upgraded design or functionality. Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Notice 15-1 (June 22, 2015). There is no contract amount requirement, nor a requirement that the existing component or tangible personal property be removed. Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Notice 15-1 (June 22, 2015). Examples include, but are not limited to any required removal and installation of:• bathroom fixtures; • tile roof; • sprinkler system; or • HVAC unit. Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Notice 15-1. Alteration is defined as an activity that causes a direct physical change to existing property. Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Notice 15-1 (June 22, 2015). There are different requirements for alterations depending on whether the property is residential or commercial property. Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Notice 15-1 (June 22, 2015). To meet the definition of residential alteration under a MRRA contract, the contract price for the work of a residential property must be 25 percent or less of the property's full cash value. Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Notice 15-1 (June 22, 2015). The property's full cash value is determined by the County Assessor's website or on the Notice of Value issued by the County Assessor. Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Notice 15-1 (June 22, 2015). Prior to Jan. 1, 2019, to meet the definition of commercial alteration under a MRRA contract, the following conditions must be met for commercial property:• the contract amount must be $750,000 or less; • the scope of work must directly relate to 40 percent or less of the existing square footage; and • the scope of work must not involve expanding the square footage of the existing property by more than 10 percent. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5075(R)(1)(b), as amended by 2018 Ariz. S.B. 1409, effective Jan. 1, 2019; Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Notice 15-1 (June 22, 2015). Effective Jan. 1, 2019, these square footage limitations are removed, and a contract may qualify as a commercial alteration so long as the contract amount does not exceed $750,000. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5075(R)(1)(b), as amended by 2018 Ariz. S.B. 1409, effective Jan. 1, 2019. If a project qualifies as an alteration under a MRRA contract at the time the contract is bid or entered into, later increases to the contract amount and/or scope will not disqualify it as an alteration if none of the threshold amounts are exceeded by 25 percent at completion.
