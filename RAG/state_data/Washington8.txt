Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Prepared Food General Rule

Taxable Washington's food and food ingredients exemption does not apply to prepared food. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0293(2); Wash. Rev. Code §82.12.0293(2); Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-244(3)(i); Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Taxability Matrix, Washington (version 2018.0). Prepared food is excluded from the exemptions applicable to food and food ingredients. The term prepared food generally means heated foods, combined foods, or foods sold with utensils provided by the seller. The term does not include food sold by a seller whose proper primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) classification is manufacturing in sector 311, except bakeries (3118), unless the food is sold with utensils provided by the seller. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0293(2)(b)(ii)(A); Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-244(3)(i); Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Taxability Matrix, Washington (version 2018.0). Heated Foods With the exception of bakery items, food or food ingredients sold in a heated state are taxable as “prepared foods.” Food is not treated as being sold in a heated state if it is heated by the customer in a microwave provided by the seller. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0293(2)(b)(i)(A); Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-244(4)(a). Combined Foods Foods or food ingredients are prepared foods if the items sold consist of two or more foods or food ingredients mixed or combined by the seller for sale as a single item, unless the food or food ingredients are any of the following:• bakery items; • items that the seller only cuts, repackages, or pasteurizes; • items that contain eggs, fish, meat, or poultry, in a raw or undercooked state requiring cooking as recommended by the Food and Drug Administration;or • items sold in an unheated state as a single item at a price that varies based on weight or volume. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-244(4)(b). Food Sold With Utensils Food or food ingredients sold with utensils provided by the seller are not exempt. Utensils include plates, knives, spoons, forks, glasses, cups, napkins, and straws. A plate does not include a container or packaging used to transport the food. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-244(4)(c); Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Taxability Matrix, Washington (version 2018.0). If the food or food ingredient is prepackaged with a utensil, the seller is considered to have physically delivered a utensil to the customer, unless the food and utensils are prepackaged together by a food manufacture. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-244(4)(c)(i). Examples of utensils provided by manufacturers include juice boxes that are packaged with drinking straws, and yogurt or ice cream cups that are packaged with wooden or plastic spoons. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-244(4)(c)(i). Individual items are considered to be food and food ingredients sold with utensils provided by the seller if a plate, glass, cup, or bowl is necessary to receive the food or food ingredient and the seller makes those utensils available to customers. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-244(4)(c)(ii). All food and food ingredients sold at an establishment are sold with utensils provided by the seller if the seller makes utensils available to its customers and the seller's gross sale of prepared food equals more than 75 percent of the seller's gross sales of all food and food ingredients, prepared food, soft drinks, and dietary supplements. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-244(4)(c)(iii). However, four servings or more of food or food ingredients packaged for sale as a single item do not count as food sold with utensils, if the seller does not customarily deliver a utensil with the package as part of the transaction. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-244(4)(c)(iii)(A); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0196 (March 31, 2017). Bakery Items Unlike most other foods, bakery items will not be treated as taxable prepared food merely because they are sold in a heated state or consist of two or more foods or food ingredients combined by the seller for sale as a single item. Bakery items will be treated as taxable prepared food if sold with utensils provided by the seller. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0293(2)(b)(i)(B); Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0293(2)(b)(ii)(C); Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-244(4). Examples of bakery items include:• bread; • rolls; • buns; • biscuits; • bagels; • croissants; • pastries; • donuts; • Danishes; • cakes; • tortes; • pies; • tarts; • muffins; • bars; • cookies;and • tortillas. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0293(2)(b)(ii)(C); Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-244(4)(a). The Washington Department of Revenue has adopted the position that savory baked goods, such as meat or vegetable piroshkies, pierogi, pasties, empanadas, samosas, and calzones, do not constitute “pastries” eligible for treatment as bakery items. Therefore, the Department of Revenue generally treats those savory baked goods as taxable prepared food, regardless of whether they are sold with utensils. Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0196 (March 31, 2017); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 09-0280 (Dec. 15, 2010). Food Sold by Restaurants Sales to consumers of meals and prepared foods by restaurants, cocktail bars, taverns, and similar businesses are generally subject to the retail sales tax. This includes meals sold to the employees of a business. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-124(2). However, a retail sales exemption is available for the following meals:• complimentary meals provided to restaurant employees; • prepared meals sold under a state administered nutrition program for the aged as provided in the Older Americans Act; • prepared meals sold to or for senior citizens, disabled persons, or low-income persons by a not-for-profit organization; and • prepared meals sold to the federal government. However, meals sold to federal employees are taxable, even if the federal employee will be reimbursed for the cost of the meals by the federal government. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-124(2); Washington Special Notice June 11, 2015. Food Sold by Food Service Contractors Meals and prepared food sold by food service contractors to customers are subject to retail sales tax. For example, the operation of a cafeteria that provides meals to employees of a manufacturing business is generally a retail activity. The food service contractor is considered to be making retail sales of meals, whether payment for the meals is made by the employees or the business, unless the business itself is reselling the meals to the employees. However, gross proceeds derived from food service management are not subject to retail sales tax. This treatment applies when the food service contractor merely manages the food service operation of an institution or business that is itself selling meals or providing the meals as part of the services the institution or business renders to its customers. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-119(3). Determining Total Sales of Prepared Foods The seller must determine a prepared food sales percentage annually for the seller's establishment in the state based on the prior year of sales. The seller may elect to determine its prepared food sales percentage based on the prior calendar year or fiscal year. A seller must obtain consent from the Department of Revenue to change its elected method. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-244(4)(c)(iii)(B). The seller must determine its annual prepared food sales percentage no later than 90 days after the beginning of the seller's calendar or fiscal year. A seller may make a good faith estimate of its first annual prepared food sales percentage if the seller's records for the prior year are not sufficient to allow the seller to calculate the prepared food sales percentage. The seller must adjust its good faith estimate if its relative sales of prepared foods in the first 90 days of operation materially depart from the seller's estimate. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-244(4)(c)(iii)(B). If prepared food sales are greater than 75 percent of total food sales, sales tax applies to all food sales, with the exception of packages containing four or more servings. Restaurants, fast food outlets, diners, and caterers are examples of businesses whose prepared food usually exceeds 75 percent of total food sales. Washington Special Notice Nov. 5, 2013. For purposes of this rule, taxpayers with multiple establishments within the state may calculate a separate percentage of prepared food sales for each establishment or calculate one percentage combining sales from all establishments within the state. If some of a taxpayer's business establishments within the state are dissimilar from others, the taxpayer may group sales from similar businesses in determining their percentages. Washington Excise Tax Advisory 3184.2013. Example: A taxpayer owns several sandwich franchise locations and sold bagged chips both individually and as a part of single price meal options with other prepared foods. Bagged chips are typically treated as a non-prepared food item exempt from retail sales tax as a food or food ingredient. Result:Because 75 percent or more of the sandwich franchise locations' total sales are non-exempt prepared foods, the bagged chips are treated as non-exempt prepared foods. Therefore, the taxpayer must charge retail sales tax on bagged chips. Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 16-0016 (Jan. 15, 2016). BNA-SUTN WA 11.2.1.
