Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Taxation of Services

Taxable Gross receipts from services performed within New Mexico are subject to gross receipts tax. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-3.5(A)(1). Gross receipts from services performed out-of-state, other than research and development services, are exempt from New Mexico's gross receipts tax. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-13.1(A). Gross receipts from research and development services performed out-of-state are subject to New Mexico's gross receipts tax if the product of the services is initially used in New Mexico. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-3.5(A)(1). Unlike traditional sales and use taxes, which collect a tax directly from the consumer on behalf of the state, the gross receipts tax is imposed on the service vendor. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3 § 2.4.8. New Mexico defines a service as all activities engaged in for other persons, for a consideration, which involve predominantly the performance of a service as distinguished from selling property. This definition of service also includes construction labor related to a construction project. N.M. Stat. Ann. § 7-9-3(M). In addition, the contractor's receipts related to personal property incorporated into real property are taxable. The New Mexico gross receipts and use tax levied on services is unusual in that the tax can be paid twice on property transferred in connection with rendering a taxable service. This appears to be a result of the fact that the gross receipts tax is imposed on the seller as opposed to the consumer. The New Mexico regulations cite several cases where property may not be purchased by a service provider under a nontaxable transaction certificate if it is not industry practice to separately itemize the property when the service provider's customer is billed. Watch repairers cannot purchase repair parts under a nontaxable transaction certificate because it is not customary for watch repairers to bill parts separately to customers. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3 § 2.205.10(A)(8)(F). On the other hand, morticians can purchase caskets, flowers, or burial clothes tax-exempt as sales for resale because those items are generally billed to customers separately from the service. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3 § 2.205.10(A)(8)(E). New Mexico also distinguishes in this manner items sold to lawn care providers and landscapers. The fertilizer and chemicals used in lawn care are generally not separately itemized and therefore are taxable when purchased by the service provider. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3 § 2.205.10(A)(8)(C). The New Mexico Department of Revenue ruled that cleaning products purchased by a janitorial services firm, which are not billed separately to customers, are taxable in In re Maintenance Svcs. Sys.. New Mexico Public Decision No. 99-02 (Jan. 21, 1999). For landscapers, however, trees, shrubs, and ornaments would be separately stated on the bill to the landscaper's customer. The service provider may purchase these items under a nontaxable transaction certificate. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3 § 2.205.10(A)(8)(D). To source the appropriate receipts to the state, cost accounting methods that reasonably allocate all costs to the location of the performance of the service should be used to determine the amount of services performed in New Mexico. If adequate cost accounting records are not kept for the allocation of costs to specific locations, the receipts from performing such services should be prorated based on the percentage of services actually performed within New Mexico. The percentage should be calculated by dividing the time spent by the prime contractor in performing such services in New Mexico by the total contract time spent performing services elsewhere. Other reasonable methods of prorating professional services may be acceptable if approved by the Department of Taxation and Revenue before the services are performed. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-3.5; N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-4; N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-7; N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.1.18(C)(1). Generally, tangible personal property transferred in a taxable service transaction, other than construction, will be deemed to be incorporated into the value of the service sold when the seller is not regularly engaged in selling or leasing the same or similar tangible personal property other than in conjunction with a service and when: • the transaction is primarily the performance of work and the transfer of any property through the transaction is incidental to the performance of the required work; • the transaction requires the performance of work which is substantially greater in value than the value of tangible personal property involved in the transaction; or • the performer of the service has the power to significantly influence the degree of involvement of the tangible personal property in the service. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3 § 2.1.29(D). Construction is also defined as a service under the regulations; however, a person engaging in the construction business may execute a nontaxable transaction certificate for the purchase of tangible personal property which will become an ingredient or component part of the construction project. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3 § 2.1.29(D)(6). Service providers that operate in more than one state may have difficulty arguing that their gross receipts should be apportioned between in-state and out-of-state activities. In ITT Educational Services, Inc. v. Taxation & Revenue Department, a nationwide technical–vocational school argued unsuccessfully that certain receipts were for services performed outside New Mexico and were not subject to the New Mexico gross receipts tax. The court disagreed, emphasizing that ITT's New Mexico facility was in the business of providing teaching services in New Mexico, and the receipts at issue were incidental to its true service, that of teaching in New Mexico. ITT Educ. Svcs., Inc. v. New Mexico Taxn. & Rev. Dept., 959 P.2d 969 (N.M. Ct. App. 1998). The taxpayer relied on the Department's ruling in New Mexico Ruling No. 410-90-2, in which an attorney's receipts attributable to services performed outside of New Mexico were excluded from the calculation of the attorney's New Mexico gross receipts tax. The court said this ruling was distinguishable from ITT's situation because it addressed “services that are clearly apportionable, independent legal services performed in two states.” New Mexico Ruling No. 410-90-2,(March 21, 1990), discussed in ITT Educ. Svcs., Inc. v. New Mexico Taxn. & Rev. Dept., 959 P.2d 969 (N.M. Ct. App. 1998). Prison Operations Receipts paid to a private prison company for prison management and operation services are subject to gross receipts tax. See New Mexico Public Decision No. 14-35 (Nov. 20, 2014) (finding the Operating and Management Agreement between the taxpayer, a private prison company, and the county predominately regarded the performance of taxpayer's services, and did not constitute a license or other piece of tangible personal property that could qualify for deduction from tax; the non-taxable transaction certificate(NTTC) that the taxpayer received was incorrect). Such transactions are for the sale of services, not licenses. New Mexico Public Decision No. 18-21 (July 19, 2018). Franchise Fees Franchise fees are taxable whether received as continual payments or as a lump sum. These fees are taxable even to franchisers located out-of-state. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3 § 2.1.7(E). Trademark licensing royalty fees received by a franchiser from a franchisee in exchange for the franchisee's right to use a limited trademark license as part of a franchise are subject to the gross receipts tax. These fees are taxable as money received from the granting of a franchise right and do not constitute exempt trademark licensing fees. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-3.5(A)(1); ATC Healthcare Svcs., Inc. v. N.M. Taxation & Rev. Dept., No. A-1-CA-36081, 2019 BL 181067 (N.M. Ct. App. May 7, 2019); A&W Rests., Inc. v. New Mexico Taxn. & Rev. Dept., No. A-1-CA-35999, 2018 BL 303733 (N.M. Ct. App. Aug. 22, 2018). Athletic Officials Receipts from refereeing, umpiring, scoring or other officiating at school events sanctioned by the New Mexico activities association are exempt from gross receipts tax. However, receipts of a referee, umpire, scorer, or other similar athletic official from umpiring, refereeing, scoring, or officiating at a sporting event located in New Mexico that was not sanctioned by the New Mexico activities association are receipts derived from the performance of a service and are subject to the gross receipts tax. These receipts will not be exempted from the gross receipts tax as “wages” unless the umpires, referees, scorers and other athletic officials demonstrate to the Department that the receipts are derived from an employment relationship whereby they are employees within the meaning of N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.105.7, which lists the indicia considered to determine whether a person is an employee. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-41.4; N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.1.18(K). Racing Receipts The receipts of horsemen, jockeys, and trainers for race purses and the receipts of vehicle or animal owners from winning purse money at races held in New Mexico are receipts from performing services in New Mexico and are subject to the gross receipts tax if any charge is made for attending, observing, or broadcasting the race. Similarly, receipts of vehicle drivers, animal riders, drivers, and other persons from receiving a percentage of the owner's purse are receipts from performing services in New Mexico and are subject to the gross receipts tax, unless the person receiving the percentage of purse money is considered an “employee” under N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.105.7, of the owner. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.1.18(L). If there is an agreement between the driver, rider, or other person and the owner for distribution of the winning purse, then only the amounts received pursuant to the agreement are gross receipts of the driver, rider, or other person receiving the distribution. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.1.18(L). Racetrack Operators Receipts of operators of racetracks, other than horse racetracks, from gate admission fees and entrance fees paid by drivers are subject to the gross receipts tax. Any portion of these fees paid out by the operator as prizes are not exempt or deductible since the payments are part of the operator's cost of doing business. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.1.18(Z). Allied Company Underwriting Automotive Service Contracts When a New Mexico automotive dealer pays an entity that is allied or affiliated with that dealer (allied company)to undertake all of the dealer's obligations under automotive service contracts on which the dealer is promisor, the undertaking of the allied company does not involve the sale of property in New Mexico or the lease of property employed in New Mexico. The undertaking principally involves an obligation of the allied company to indemnify the dealer by paying the dealer for furnishing parts and labor to fulfill the dealer's obligation to furnish the parts and labor. However, the undertaking also involves the performance of services by the allied company for the dealer since the allied company undertakes to handle the claims of automotive service contract purchasers and otherwise perform the dealer's task under the contract. Absent a showing of a different value by the allied company or the Department, 7.5 percent of the contract amount paid by the dealer to the allied company will be treated as consideration received for services performed in New Mexico. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.1.18(DD). Commissions of Independent Contractors When Another Pays Gross Receipts Tax on the Receipts From the Underlying Transaction Commissions and other consideration received by an independent contractor from performing a sales service in New Mexico with respect to the tangible or intangible personal property of other persons are gross receipts whether or not the other person reports and pays gross receipts tax with respect to the receipts from the sale of the property. This situation involves two separate transactions. The first is the sale of the property by its owner to the customer and the second is the performance of a sales service by the independent contractor for the owner of the property. The receipts from the sale of the property are gross receipts of the person whose property was sold. Receipts, whether in the form of commissions or other remuneration, of the person performing a sales service in New Mexico are gross receipts of the person performing the sales service. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.1.18(HH)(1). Receipts From Winning Contest Receipts of a contestant from winning purse money in a rodeo or an athletic game, match, or tournament held in New Mexico are gross receipts from performing services if any charge is made for attending, observing, or broadcasting the event. These receipts are subject to the gross receipts tax unless an exemption or deduction applies. Where the contestant is a team and there is an agreement among the team members governing distribution of the purse money, then only the amount received by each team member pursuant to the agreement is gross receipts of the team member. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.1.18(II). Reimbursed Expenditures The receipts of any person received as a reimbursement of expenditures incurred in connection with the performance of a service or the sale or lease of property are gross receipts as defined by N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-3.5, unless that person incurs such expense as agent on behalf of a principal while acting in a disclosed agency capacity. An agency relationship exists if a person has the power to bind a principal in a contract with a third party so that the third party can enforce the contractual obligation against the principal. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.1.19(C)(1); see also New Mexico Public Decision No. 14-16 (May 22, 2014) (a taxpayer providing temporary services to the City of Albuquerque, is not a disclosed agent and cannot legally bind the city in contractual agreements). Receipts from the reimbursement of expenses incurred as agent on behalf of a principal while acting in a disclosed agency capacity are not included in the agent's gross receipts if:• the agent accounts for such receipts in the agent's books and records as a reduction of the expense and not as revenue; and • the expenses are separately stated on the agent's billing to the client and are identified in the agent's books and records as reimbursements of expenses incurred on behalf of the principal party. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.1.19(C)(2); Bogle Mgmt. Co., Inc. v. New Mexico Taxn. & Rev. Dept., No. A-1-CA-35641, (N.M. Ct. App. Dec. 5, 2017); see New Mexico Public Decision No. 18-15 (April 27, 2018). If these requirements are not met, the reimbursements of expenses are included in the agent's gross receipts. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.1.19(C)(3). Reimbursement of Expenditures Made to Volunteers A volunteer who contributes time, effort, or talent without expectation of consideration or remuneration is not selling the services performed. When a volunteer receives reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the performance of a service as a volunteer that were directly related to the work volunteered, reimbursement of those expenses is not gross receipts. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.1.19(D)(1). Reimbursement includes per diem amounts set by statute to reimburse uncompensated elected and appointed governmental officials for the expense of carrying out official duties. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.1.19(D)(3). Commissions Received on Sales of Real Estate and Intangible Personal Property Receipts of an insured derived from payments made by an insurer pursuant to an insurance policy are not subject to gross receipts tax. Such receipts are not receipts derived from the sale of property in New Mexico, the leasing of property employed in New Mexico, or the performance of a service. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.1.16(A). Receipts of a person in the business of constructing improvements on real property owned and sold in the ordinary course of that person's construction business do not include amounts retained by financial institutions as prepaid finance charges or discounts, if these amounts are not received by the real estate vendor. It is immaterial whether or not such amounts are included in the quoted real estate sales price. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.1.16(B). The receipts of a person from selling an automotive service contract are not gross receipts. Automotive service contract “means an undertaking, promise or obligation of the promisor, for a consideration separate from the sale price of a motor vehicle, to furnish or to pay for parts and labor to repair specified parts of the covered motor vehicle only if breakdowns (failures) of those specified parts occur within certain time or mileage limits.” N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.1.16(C). The furnishing by the promisor of parts or labor or both to fulfill the promisor's obligation when a breakdown occurs is a taxable event. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.1.16(C). The receipts of a New Mexico automotive dealer from an insurance company are not taxable gross receipts if the payments by the insurance company are to reimburse the dealer, who is promisor under an automotive service contract as that term is defined in N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.1.16(C), for all parts and labor furnished by the dealer pursuant to the contract or for parts and labor furnished by the dealer pursuant to the contract in an amount in excess of a specified reserve established by the dealer under an agreement with the insurance company. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.1.16(D). Receipts from the sale of gift certificates are receipts from the sale of intangible personal property of a type not included in the definition of “property” and, therefore, are not subject to gross receipts tax. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.1.16(E). BNA-SUTN NM 9.2.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

Depends When a transaction is predominantly a service, any tangible personal property transferred in conjunction with the service is incidental to the service, and the value of the property becomes an element of and is incorporated into the value of the service sold. Type 2 nontaxable transaction certificates may not be executed to acquire the property so incorporated. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.1.29(D)(2); N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.205.10(A)(8). When a service provider is also regularly engaged in selling by itself the type of tangible personal property transferred in the transaction, a single transaction may include both the sale of a service and the sale of tangible personal property as distinct and separate parts of the transaction. A Type 2 nontaxable transaction certificate, which covers sales for resale of property, may be used to acquire the tangible personal property resold if the transaction is predominantly the sale of a service. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.1.29(D)(10); N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.205.10(A)(8). A transaction involving both the transfer of tangible personal property to the buyer and the performance of a service is predominantly a service when the seller is not regularly engaged in selling property (other than with services) and one of the following conditions applies:• the transaction is primarily the performance of work and the transfer of any property through the transaction is incidental to the performance of the required work; • the transaction requires the performance of work that is substantially greater in value than the value of the tangible personal property involved in the transaction; or • the performer of the service has the power to influence significantly the degree of involvement of the tangible personal property in the transaction.

Depends New Mexico's statutes and regulations do not expressly address bundled transactions, with the exception of computers, computer related products and computer software. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.242.14. Sales of taxable computers, computer software, and computer related equipment that are bundled with exempt sales during New Mexico's tax holiday, as set forth under N.M. Stat. Ann. § 7-9-95, are subject to sales and use tax unless they are included in the purchase price of the tax exempt item. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.242.14; N.M. Stat. Ann. § 7-9-95.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Local Jurisdictions, Taxability Distinctions

Conforms to State New Mexico law provides that local gross receipts and compensating taxes are generally subject to the same tax base as the state gross receipts tax. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-19D-4(A); N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-20E-4(A); New Mexico Bulletin FYI-C120; New Mexico Bulletin FYI-M121. The local gross receipts taxes are to be combined and collected with the state gross receipts tax. New Mexico Bulletin FYI-C120; New Mexico Bulletin FYI-M121. Local taxes are collected in the same manner as the state gross receipts taxes and subject to the same nexus and sourcing rules. New Mexico Bulletin FYI-C120; New Mexico Bulletin FYI-M121. Prior to July 1, 2021, New Mexico bars the imposition of any local option gross receipts taxes on the transportation of persons or property for hire by railroad, motor vehicle, air transportation or any other means from one point within the municipality to another point outside the municipality. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-19D-5, as amended by 2019 N.M. H.B. 6, §48, effective July 1, 2019. BNA-SUTN NM 9.4.
