Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Local Option Sales and Use Tax

Local Tax Authorized The state of Wyoming has authorized counties to enact a local sales tax and a corresponding use tax for general or specific purposes, in addition to the state sales and use tax. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-202(b); Wyo. Stat. §39-16-202(b); Wyo. Stat. §39-15-204(a); Wyo. Stat. §39-16-204(a); Wyo. Stat. §39-16-202(c); Wyo. Stat. §39-16-202(e). Local county, transit authority, and special district sales and use taxes may also be imposed. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-202(b). Specific Local Option Tax Types County Sales and Use Tax for General Revenue Purposes Wyoming law authorizes counties to impose a sales and corresponding use tax in increments of 0.5 percent, up to 2 percent, upon the retail sales of tangible personal property, admissions, and services provided within the county, and upon the storage, use, and consumption of tangible personal property within the county, for general revenue purposes. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-202(b); Wyo. Stat. §39-16-202(b); Wyo. Stat. §39-15-204(a)(i), as amended by 2017 Wyo. H.B. 82, effective July 1, 2017; Wyo. Stat. §39-16-204(a)(i), as amended by 2017 Wyo.

Stat. §39-15-203(a)(i)(A); Wyo. Stat. §39-16-203(a)(i)(A). Under Wyoming law, if a local sales and use tax is imposed by a county for general revenue purposes, the locally imposed tax will apply to the same transaction types, have the same definitions, and exemptions, and must include provisions identical to those of the Wyoming state tax, in so far as it relates to sales and use taxes.

Stat. §39-16-202(e). To enact the tax, the governing body of the county and the governing bodies of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the incorporated municipalities within the county must approve the proposed tax, setting forth the amount of revenue to be collected and the purpose for which it is collected, before it is submitted to the voters in the county. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-203(a)(iii)(A); Wyo. Stat. §39-16-203(a)(ii)(A). Upon approval of the governing body of the county and at least two-thirds (2/3) of the incorporated municipalities within the county, the tax will be enacted when the proposition is submitted and approved by a majority vote of the electors. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-203(a)(iii)(C); Wyo. Stat. §39-16-203(a)(ii)(C). The revenue from the tax must be used only in the specified amount and for the specific purposes that were authorized by the voters.

Wyo. Stat. §39-15-203(a)(iii)(G); Wyo. Stat. §39-16-203(a)(ii)(G). It is also the sponsoring entities obligation to inform the Wyoming Department of Revenue and the county treasurer that the tax is terminated. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-203(a)(iii)(G); Wyo. Stat. §39-16-203(a)(ii)(G).

Wyo. Stat. §39-16-202(e); Wyo. Stat. §39-16-204(a)(v). The sales and use tax for economic development will be enacted upon approval of a majority of the county electors. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-203(a)(v)(A); Wyo. Stat. §39-16-203(a)(iv)(A).

Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Excise and Replacement Taxes

Yes Excise Taxes Wyoming imposes several excise taxes that function in a manner similar to the state's transactional sales and use tax. Examples of excise taxes include:• the motor vehicle rental surcharge; Wyo. Stat. §31-19-105(a). • the lodging tax; and Wyo. Stat. §39-15-101(a)(ii). • the motor vehicle fuel tax. Wyo. Stat. §39-17-103. Replacement Taxes The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement prohibits member states from imposing a “prohibited replacement tax” which is a tax outside of the sales and use tax that is imposed on products defined in the Agreement. Generally, the Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board will make a finding regarding whether or not a member state has imposed a replacement tax. Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, as amended through Dec. 14, 2018, Section 334; Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board Rules and Procedures, as amended through May 3, 2018, Rule 334.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Historical Information

Est. 1935 Sales tax was first imposed in Wyoming in 1935. See Phil Roberts, A History of the Wyoming Sales Tax: How Lawmakers Chose It from Among Severance Taxes, an Income Tax, Gambling, and a Lottery, U. Wy. L. Rev. 4, 157 (2004); Wyoming Taxpayers Association, Sales and Use Taxes; Sales &Use Tax Exemptions in Wyoming. The governor of Wyoming enacted the “Emergency Sales Tax Act of 1935” to bring in additional revenue during the Great Depression. Wyoming chose to enact sales tax legislation in lieu of imposing an income tax. All retail firms were required to purchase an annual sales tax license at a cost of $2.00. The retail firms were then required to remit a tax of 2 percent on the retail sale of tangible personal property, meals and cover charges, and admission and amusement charges. There were many exemptions written into the legislation, including exemptions for sales of commodities, ingredients, components, power, fuel, animals, seeds and fertilizer, sales to federal and state agencies, and sales to charitable organizations. The initial Act expired on March 31, 1937. On April 1, 1937, the legislature passed a permanent law, known as the “Selective Sales Tax Act of 1937,” which imposed a permanent sales tax rate of 2 percent. The current rate of 4 percent began in 1993. Phil Roberts, See A History of the Wyoming Sales Tax: How Lawmakers Chose It from Among Severance Taxes, an Income Tax, Gambling, and a Lottery, U. Wy. L.

Examples of prepaid wireless communications access include:• prepaid wireless calling cards preloaded with minutes or units of airtime; • prepaid wireless phones that are sold for a single, non-itemized or “bundled”price if they are preloaded with more than 10 minutes of airtime or with more than $5.00 worth of prepaid wireless service; • a recharge or reload of units or minutes of prepaid wireless airtime whether through the seller's website, or over the telephone or in person at the seller's physical location; and • prepaid unlimited use of wireless service for a fixed time period, and such service automatically terminates unless additional payment is made. Wyoming Taxing Issues - December 2015. Wyoming vendors were required to return a survey to the Department of Revenue, indicating whether or not they are retailers of prepaid wireless communications access, by January 31, 2016. Those retailers who have not returned the survey will be presumed to be retailers of prepaid wireless communications access and will be required to file the return for the tax on such access. As of June 2016, the Department was accepting surveys past the January deadline and was requesting that Wyoming vendors complete the survey and submit it as soon as possible, via mail, fax, or e-mail.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Use' or 'Storage, Use, or Consumption'

Defined In Wyoming, “use” is defined as the exercise of any right or power over tangible personal property or specified digital products incident to ownership or by any transaction where possession is given by lease or contract. Wyo. Stat. §39-16-101(a)(ix). The use tax must be determined when tangible personal property is first stored, used, or consumed in the state. Wyo. Regs. ch. 2, §3(h)(i); In re Yellow Book Sales & Dist. Co., Wyoming Administrative Decision 2010-65 (April 29, 2011) (a company's telephone directories that were produced out-of-state, shipped to and stored in Wyoming, and that were first used or consumed in the state when they were delivered to Wyoming businesses and households were subject to use tax). The storage of tangible personal property for sale in the course of business or subsequent use outside the state does not constitute a taxable use. Wyo. Stat. §39-16-101(a)(v); see also In re Range Tel. Coop., Inc., Wyoming Administrative Decision 2014-14 (Sept. 23, 2015) (where a buyer stores and sorts equipment for out-of-state delivery, but does not take title to equipment in Wyoming, the buyer has not made a taxable use of the property). If a taxable service is rendered out-of-state but the customer makes first use of service in Wyoming, then the service is subject to use tax. See Wyoming Sales and Use Tax Bulletin - Use Tax. First Use Generally The use tax does not apply to tangible personal property when it is purchased and first used in another state and used for the purpose for which it was manufactured or assembled, before its use in Wyoming. Wyo. Regs. ch. 2 §3(h)(ii). Admiral Beverage Corp. The so-called “first use” rule was applied in a decision by the Board of Equalization in 2016. There, the taxpayer, Admiral Beverage Corp., purchased an airplane in South Carolina for $4 million. The airplane was purchased for business travel. The taxpayer paid sales tax on the airplane in South Carolina; however, the sales tax on purchases of aircraft in South Carolina is capped at $300, so only a nominal amount of tax was paid compared to the sales price. See S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-2110(A)(1). The airplane was registered upon purchase, as required by the FAA, and the address on the registration was the corporation's address in Wyoming. The airplane was repaired in South Carolina. Subsequently, the airplane was flown from South Carolina to Texas, and then from Texas to Montana (via a stop for fuel in Nebraska) for business purposes. Finally, the corporation's president used the airplane for transportation from Montana to Wyoming. The corporation admitted that the airplane is domiciled within Wyoming. The Department of Revenue issued a determination that the corporation owed Wyoming use tax on the full purchase price of the airplane (or, $4 million). The corporation appealed the matter to the Board of Equalization, arguing that the airplane had been “first used” outside Wyoming, and therefore was not subject to use tax. The department disagreed with the corporation's analysis, asserting that the “first use” rule only applied to nonresidents, giving the example of a nonresident moving to Wyoming with his furniture and other household goods. In that instance, the department stated that it would consider the items first used outside Wyoming and would not impose use tax. The board agreed with the taxpayer corporation that bona fide first use of the airplane had occurred out of state. The board emphasized that “bona fide first use” depended on the property in question being used for its intended purpose, and not on whether the property had been used out of state in attempt to evade taxation. Further, the board found that the department could not restrict application of the first use rule to only nonresidents, as that interpretation is contrary to the language in the statute. The airplane had been use by taxpayer for its intended purpose (transportation)prior to being stored, used, or consumed in Wyoming, and therefore was not subject to use tax. In re Admiral Beverage Corp., Wyoming Administrative Decision 2014-107 (Oct. 19, 2016); see also Wyo. Stat. §39-16-101(a)(ix); Wyo. Stat. §39-16-103(a)(i); Wyo. Stat. §39-16-103(c)(iv). In re Morton Buildings The Wyoming State Board of Equalization has held that use tax applies to materials purchased and processed into building components outside the state and used to construct buildings within Wyoming. In In re Morton Buildings Inc., the taxpayer, an Illinois company, sold and erected pre-fabricated buildings for use in Wyoming and in other states. The taxpayer purchased raw materials outside of the state and made them into building components at factories located outside the state. When a customer ordered a building, the taxpayer withdrew the necessary raw materials from storage and made them into building components. These materials included lumber, nails, cement, staples, insulation, and plastic sheeting. The taxpayer sought a refund on all of the use taxes it paid to Wyoming for the cost of the raw materials it used at its factories outside the state to make building components used in Wyoming. The taxpayer argued that the raw materials in issue were not “purchased from a retailer”because the building components made out of the raw materials were new and different items of tangible personal property. In its analysis, the board of equalization applied the following test to determine if the imposition of use tax on the raw materials at issue was proper:• the activity must have substantial nexus to Wyoming; • the tax must be fairly apportioned; • the tax must not discriminate against interstate commerce; and • the tax must be fairly related to state-provided services. In re Morton Buildings, Inc., Wyoming Administrative Decision A-88-150 (April 4, 1990). The Board of Equalization held that the above test was met, and further that Morton did not make the argument that there was a bona fide first use of the property outside of Wyoming. Therefore, Morton failed to meet the burden of showing that the use tax paid outside of the state was based on a bona fide first use, and tax was due to the state of Wyoming.
