Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Tangible Personal Property

Destination North Dakota sources sales of tangible personal property on a destination basis. However, sourcing rules may vary if the tangible personal property is not delivered to the purchaser's business location. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.4-11(1). Retail sales, excluding lease or rental of a product, are sourced as follows:• when a product is received by the purchaser at a business location of the seller, the sale is sourced to that business location. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.4-11(1)(a). • when a product is not received by the purchaser at a business location of the seller, the sale is sourced to the location where receipt occurs by the purchaser, or the purchaser's donee (who is designated as a donee by the purchaser), and this source includes the location indicated by instructions for delivery to the purchaser or donee when the instructions are known to the seller. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.4-11(1)(b). • when the facts of the two above situations do not apply, the sale is sourced to the address of the purchaser, which is available from the business records of the seller and are maintained in the ordinary course of the seller's business when the use of the address would not constitute bad faith. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.4-11(1)(c). • when the facts of the above three situations do not apply, the sale is sourced to the purchaser's address obtained during consummation of the sale, including the address of the purchaser's payment instrument, if use of this address would not constitute bad faith. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.4-11(1)(d). • when none of the above situations apply to the facts of a sale, including circumstance in which the seller is without sufficient information to apply the above rules, then the sale is sourced to the address from which the item was shipped or from which the service was provided. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.4-11(1)(e). Direct Mail Sourcing A purchaser of direct mail that is not a holder of a direct pay permit must provide the direct mail seller with either a direct mail permit or information showing the jurisdictions where the direct mail will be delivered to recipients. The term direct mail means printed material delivered or distributed by U.S. mail or other delivery service to a mass audience or to addresses on a mailing list provided by the purchaser or at the direction of the purchaser when the cost of the items are not billed directly to the recipients. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-01(8); N.D. Cent. Code § 57-39.4-14(1). Upon receipt of the direct pay permit, a seller is relieved of all obligations to collect, pay, or remit the applicable tax. The purchaser of direct mail becomes obligated to pay or remit the applicable tax on a direct pay basis. A direct pay permit remains in effect for all future sales of direct mail by a seller to a purchaser until it is revoked in writing. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.4-14.1(2). Upon receipt of information from a purchaser showing the jurisdictions to which the direct mail is delivered to recipients, a seller must collect the tax according to the delivery information provided by the purchaser. In the absence of bad faith, a seller is relieved of any further obligation to collect tax on any transaction in which the seller has collected tax pursuant to the delivery information provided by the purchaser. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.4-14(1)(b). If a purchaser of direct mail does not have a direct pay permit and does not provide the seller with either a direct mail permit or delivery information, the seller must collect the tax. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.4-14(2). BNA-SUTN ND 4.1.1.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Local Sourcing

Destination North Dakota follows destination-based sourcing rules for purposes of sales and use taxes imposed by local jurisdictions; thus, the local tax rate that will apply to a sale is based on where the customer takes delivery of a purchased item. North Dakota Sales Tax Newsletter September 2005. Retailers located within a local taxing jurisdiction must collect the local tax when the purchaser takes possession of the goods at the retailer's location or elsewhere within the taxing jurisdiction. However, retailers are not required to collect the local tax for goods delivered in the retailer's own vehicles or by common carrier to the purchaser outside the taxing jurisdiction. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.4-11; N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.4-11-1; North Dakota Guideline—Local Option Taxes by Location, effective Jan. 1, 2016. If the purchaser did not pay a local tax at the time of purchase, the goods will be subject to local use tax if the purchaser takes the goods into a city or county with a local use tax. The tax is due on the cost or fair market value of the goods when they enter the taxing jurisdiction. In these situations, the consumer is responsible to report the purchase and pay the local tax liability. The seller of the goods is not responsible to collect the use tax in this situation. N.D. Cent. Code §57-40.2-06(1); N.D. Cent. Code §57-40.2-07(2); N.D. Cent. Code §57-40.2-07(6); North Dakota Guideline—Local Option Taxes by Location, effective Jan. 1, 2016. A retailer does not have to collect tax if the goods are delivered in the retailer's own vehicles or by common carrier to the purchaser outside the taxing jurisdiction, but a retailer outside the jurisdiction must collect the local tax when the goods are delivered into a local taxing jurisdiction by the retailer's vehicle or common carrier into the jurisdiction if the retailer has sufficient nexus with the taxing jurisdiction. North Dakota Guideline—Local Option Taxes by Location, effective Jan. 1, 2016. In these situations where the retailer is not required to collect the tax, the purchaser, not the retailer, is responsible for reporting and paying the use tax. N.D. Cent. Code §11-09.1-05(2)(a); N.D. Cent. Code §40-05.1-06(16)(a); N.D. Cent. Code §57-40.2-02.1 (use tax paid on items used in the state but not originally purchased in the state); North Dakota Guideline—Local Option Taxes by Location, effective Jan. 1, 2016. The purchaser must pay local sales tax at the time of the purchase must pay local use tax on the fair market value of the goods if the goods are taken into a county or city that imposes a local use tax.

Local Sourcing Rules for Contractors Construction materials are subject to local tax if the materials are purchased from a retailer located in the same taxing jurisdiction as the materials are to be used in. N.D. Cent. Code §11-09.1-05(2)(a); N.D. Cent. Code §40-05.1-06(16)(a); N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-2.1(1)(a); N.D. Cent. Code §57-40.2-02.1(1); North Dakota Guideline—Local Option Taxes by Location, effective Jan. 1, 2016. The contractor may pay the tax to the retailer at the time of the sale or accrue and remit the local tax himself to the state Tax Commissioner. N.D. Cent. Code §11-09.1-05(2)(a); N.D. Cent. Code §40-05.1-06(16)(a); N.D. Cent. Code §57-40.2-3.3(1); N.D. Cent. Code §57-40.2-06(1); N.D. Cent. Code §57-40.2-06(2); North Dakota Guideline—Local Option Taxes by Location, effective Jan. 1, 2016. Some counties and cities provide an exemption from sales tax for materials that are purchased inside the jurisdiction but installed outside that jurisdiction. To qualify for the exemption, the contractor must provide the supplier a construction certificate at the time of the purchase in order to be exempt from both state and local sales taxes and pay state and local use tax when the goods are used. N.D. Cent. Code §11-09.1-05(2)(a); N.D. Cent. Code §40-05.1-06(16)(a); North Dakota Guideline—Contractors (Jan. 2012); North Dakota Guideline—Local Option Taxes by Location, effective Jan. 1, 2016. In situations where a contractor uses a contractor's certificate at the time of the purchase and therefore purchases the materials without paying sales tax, the goods are subject to use tax when and where the goods are installed.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Credit for Tax Paid to Another Jurisdiction

Yes North Dakota allows a reciprocal use tax credit up to the amount of any sales or use tax paid to another state. N.D. Cent. Code § 57-40.2-11; see N.D. Cent. Code § 57-40.2-02.1; Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Taxability Matrix, North Dakota (version 2018.0). If property was previously subject to sales or use tax in another state and the tax was paid, North Dakota use tax will not apply provided that the tax due it is equal to or less than what was already paid in the other jurisdiction. If the North Dakota use tax rate is higher than the rate imposed in the other jurisdiction, North Dakota use tax is due based on the difference of what was previously paid under the other jurisdiction's rate and use tax applies to the fair market value of the property at the time it is brought into North Dakota for use. The other jurisdiction must allow a similar credit for tax paid in North Dakota. N.D. Cent. Code § 57-40.2-11; see N.D. Cent. Code § 57-40.2-02.1; Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Taxability Matrix, North Dakota (version 2018.0). If a North Dakota Indian Tribe enters into an agreement with the governor for the administration of a tribal sales tax, only one single tax will apply to taxable transactions, such that dual taxation by both the tribe and the state will not occur. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.9-01, as added by 2019 N.D. S.B. 2258, effective April 24, 2019; North Dakota Sales Tax Newsletter June 2019. Credit for Local Taxes Paid by Contractors A contractor that uses tangible personal property in the performance of a construction contract in a county or city that imposes a use tax must pay the use tax, unless local sales or use tax has already been paid on the item.
