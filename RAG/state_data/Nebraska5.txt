Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Construction Materials and Contracts Construction Materials and Contracts, Generally

Depends Nebraska law allows contractors and repair persons to elect their tax treatment with respect to building materials used in performing their construction services. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2701.10. Building materials are items that will become real estate or which are annexed to real estate. Nebraska Information Guide No. 6-346-1994. Contractors and repair persons are given the following three options with respect to their tax treatment. See Livingston Enters., Inc., v. Nebraska Dept. of Rev., No. CI 16-2027 (Lancaster Cnty. Dist. Ct., Jan. 25, 2017). They can elect to be taxed as a:• retailer, and therefore will not be considered the final consumer of building materials annexed to real estate; Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2701.10(1). • consumer of building materials with a tax-paid inventory; Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2701.10(2). or • consumer of building materials with a tax-free inventory. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2701.10(3). The choice is made by completing and submitting a Nebraska Revenue Contractor Database and Election, Form 16, to the Department of Revenue. The form must be filed within three months after beginning to operate as a contractor. The selected option applies to all contracts. A contractor may not operate under more than one option at a time. If a Form 16 is not filed, the contractor will be treated as a retailer under the first option for sales and use tax purposes. Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-017.03; see Important Information for Contractors Performing Construction Services in Nebraska; see also Livingston Enters., Inc., v. Nebraska Dept. of Rev., No. CI 16-2027 (Lancaster Cnty. Dist. Ct., Jan. 25, 2017). Contractors may change their option by notifying the Department of Revenue in writing through the submission of a new Form 16 before the change becomes effective. When a change becomes effective, it applies to all contracts in progress and to all new contracts. All changes are effective on the first day of the month. If notified on or before the fifteenth of the month, the change will take effect a month later. Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-017.04. Any contractor who changes from a tax-free inventory(Option 1 or Option 3) to a tax-paid inventory (Option 2) must pay the tax on all building materials in inventory when the new Form 16 is submitted and pay tax on all purchases as of the date of the notification. Option 1 contractors must also pay the tax on any materials that have been incorporated into an ongoing project. Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-017.04B. Any contractor who changes from a tax-paid inventory(Option 2) to a tax-free inventory (Option 1 or Option 3) will receive a credit for the tax previously paid on its building materials provided the contractor submits with its new Form 16, a signed statement that details the amount of credit due to the contractor. The credit will be placed on the contractor's account and can be used as the building materials that were in inventory are annexed and payments become due to the state. The contractor is not entitled to a refund of tax paid. Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-017.04C. Option 1: Those Electing to Be Treated as Retailers Option 1 contractors are treated as retailers of those building materials that become annexed. Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-017.05A.

Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-017.05C. Option 1 contractors will normally not collect sales tax on separately stated labor charges. Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-017.05C.
