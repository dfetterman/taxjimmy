Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Taxation of Property

Taxable Tangible personal property is taxed in several ways under the Retailers' Occupation Tax, the Use Tax; the Service Occupation Tax, and the Service Use Tax, and is generally taxable. 35 ILCS 120/14; 35 ILCS 105/1; 35 ILCS 115/1; 35 ILCS 110/1; Illinois Dept. of Rev., Taxpayer Answer Center. The retailers' occupation tax is imposed upon persons engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail. 35 ILCS 120/2. The use tax compliments the retailers'occupation tax by imposing a tax upon tangible personal property used in Illinois that was purchased at retail. 35 ILCS 105/3. To the extent a seller must remit the retailers' occupation tax, the seller is authorized to collect and retain from its customers the complementary use tax, thereby avoiding double taxation on the associated transactions. 35 ILCS 105/9; see also Illinois v. Buffalo Confectionery Co., 401 N.E.2d 546 (Ill. 1980). The service occupation tax is an occupational tax and its complementary privilege tax is the service use tax. The taxes are applicable to tangible personal property transferred by a service person in connection with rendered services, as opposed to property sold and purchased at retail. The service occupation tax is imposed upon servicemen or service providers engaged in the business of selling services. Property transferred in connection with services is taxed, as opposed to taxing the services. The service use tax is imposed upon the privilege of using real or tangible personal property in Illinois that was received incident to a purchase of a service from a serviceman or service provider. 35 ILCS 115/3; 35 ILCS 110/3.

Depends Retailers'Occupation Tax and Use Tax do not apply to receipts from sales of personal services. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.120(d). Under the Service Occupation Tax Act, servicemen are taxed on tangible personal property transferred incident to sales of service. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §140.101;Illinois Dept. of Rev., Taxpayer Answer Center. When servicemen sell items of tangible personal property to purchasers for use or consumption apart from their rendering of service, they incur Retailers' Occupation Tax liability. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.101; Illinois General Information Letter ST 18-0036-GIL (Dec. 5, 2018). Whether a person incurs a retailers' occupation tax or service occupation tax lability depends upon the nature of the items being produced and the nature of the design work involved. Illinois General Information Letter ST 14-0009-GIL (March 10, 2014). The seller of a special machine, tool, die, jig, pattern, gauge or other similar item is engaged primarily in a service occupation, rather than in the business of selling tangible personal property, and so does not incur retailers' occupation tax liability with respect to the sale, if the following tests for exemption are all met in the transaction:• the purchaser employs the seller primarily for his engineering or other scientific skill to design and produce the property on special order for the purchaser and to meet the particular needs of the purchaser; • the property has use or value only for the specific purpose for which it is produced; and • the property has use or value only to the purchaser. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2115(b); Illinois General Information Letter ST 14-0009-GIL (March 10, 2014). Where sellers of special order property are not subject to retailers' occupation tax in accordance with Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2115, the purchase of tangible personal property transferred to service customers may result in either service occupation tax liability or use tax liability for the servicemen, depending upon which tax base the servicemen use to calculate their liability. Servicemen may calculate their tax base in one of four ways:• separately stated selling price; • 50 percent of the entire bill; • service occupation tax on cost price if they are registered de minimis servicemen;or • use tax on cost price if the servicemen are de minimis, and are not otherwise required to be registered under Section 2a of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2115; Illinois General Information Letter ST 14-0009-GIL (March 10, 2014).

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

Depends A mixed transaction occurs when there is a service being performed that includes property being transferred to the purchaser. In this situation, Illinois typically uses the true object test to determine the tax liability of the parties. Colorcraft Corp. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 493 N.E.2d 1066 (Ill. 1986); Spagat v. Mahin, 277 N.E.2d 834 (Ill. 1971); Illinois General Information Letter ST 04-0091-GIL (June 21, 2004). The true object test is a subjective test to determine what the customer really wants to purchase(i.e., either a service or property). Colorcraft Corp. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 493 N.E.2d 1066 (Ill. 1986); Spagat v. Mahin, 277 N.E.2d 834 (Ill. 1971); Illinois General Information Letter ST 04-0091-GIL (June 21, 2004). If the article sold has no value to the purchaser except as a result of the vendor's services, and if transferring the article to the purchaser is an actual and necessary part of the service rendered, then the vendor has rendered a service and has not sold tangible personal propety. However, if the article sold is the transaction's substance and the service rendered is merely incidental to and an inseparable part of that transfer, then the vendor has sold tangible personal property. Colorcraft Corp. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 493 N.E.2d 1066 (Ill. 1986); Spagat v. Mahin, 277 N.E.2d 834 (Ill. 1971). The true object test is an all-or-nothing test. When a taxing authority uses the true object test, it examines why the buyer entered into the transaction and what it was that the buyer wanted to purchase. In doing so, the taxing authority attempts to determine whether the buyer wanted a service or property. If the taxing authority determines that a service was what the buyer wanted, then it will impose sales or use tax as if the buyer purchased services. Alternatively, if it determines that property was what the buyer wanted, then it will impose sales or use tax as if the buyer purchased property. Colorcraft Corp. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 493 N.E.2d 1066 (Ill. 1986); Spagat v. Mahin, 277 N.E.2d 834 (Ill. 1971); Illinois General Information Letter ST 04-0091-GIL (June 21, 2004). Service Occupation Tax In Illinois, all persons engaged in the business of providing services are subject to the service occupation tax for tangible personal property transferred “incident to” (i.e., as part of) the service. 35 ILCS 115/3; Ill. Admin. Code, tit. 86 § 140.101; see, e.g., Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0012-GIL (Jan. 30, 2015) (explaining the four service occupation tax calculation methods in response to an inquiry from a company that contracts with medical facilities to release medical records to third parties). BNA-SUTN IL 9.3.1.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Bundled Transactions

Depends Illinois law addresses bundled transactions in the context of a nontaxable service bundled with tangible personal property. The department has applied the “true object” test in the context of examining bundled exempt services with tangible personal property or taxable telecommunications services. Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0027-GIL (April 30, 2015). The department has indicated that the true object test is an all-or-nothing test, and it looks at the reason or purpose the buyer entered into the transaction and what the buyer wanted to purchase. If the purpose is to obtain a taxable item, e.g., tangible personal property, the entire transaction is taxable unless the taxable and nontaxable items are separately stated. Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0027-GIL (April 30, 2015). BNA-SUTN IL 9.3.2.

Conforms to State Illinois imposes local sales and use tax which mirrors its state structure. See Illinois Informational Bulletin FY 2017-16 (May 2017). Illinois allows municipalities, counties and other municipal corporations to impose taxes on persons “engaged in the business of selling” in their jurisdictions. 55 ILCS 5/5-1006; 70 ILCS 3615/4.03(e) (authorizing the Regional Transportation Authority to impose a tax on persons “engaged in the business of selling” within a six-county region; Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0001-GIL (Jan. 7, 2015). Regional Transportation Authority Retailers' Occupation Tax and Service Occupation Tax The board of directors of the Regional Transportation Authority (RTA) is authorized to impose a retailers' occupation tax on retailers within the region, which consists of the counties of DuPage, Will, Lake, McHenry, Kane and Cook. If the Regional Transportation Authority imposes a retailers' occupation tax, it must also impose a service occupation tax at the same rate. The rate of tax is 0.75 percent in Cook County for items other than food and drugs; the rate of tax on food and drugs in Cook County is 1 percent. The rate of tax in the surrounding counties is 0.25 percent, regardless of the item. A use tax component is imposed upon purchases made outside the county that are titled or registered with a state agency, typically boats, airplanes and automobiles, with the tax being collected from persons whose address for titling and registration purposes is in the region. 70 ILCS 3615/4.03; Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0047-GIL (July 23, 2015). Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Tax Within specified areas of Chicago and its surroundings, including certain watercraft on Lake Michigan, the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority levies a retailers' occupation tax at a rate of 1 percent on the gross receipts from the sale of food, alcoholic beverages and soft drinks for on-premises or off-premises consumption by retailers whose principal source of receipts comes from the sale of food and beverages prepared for immediate consumption. 70 ILCS 210/13. The Illinois Supreme Court has held taxes on food and beverages are valid under both the Illinois Constitution and the U.S. Constitution. Geja's Cafe v. Metropolitan Pier & Exposition Auth., 153 Ill. 2d 239, 606 N.E.2d 1212 (1992). In addition to the food and beverage taxes, the Authority also imposes a 2.5-percent tax on the gross receipts from the business of renting, leasing or letting hotel rooms within Chicago, excluding proceeds derived from rooms that are rented to permanent residents. Within Cook County, the Authority levies a 6 percent occupation tax on the gross receipts of all persons engaged in the business of renting automobiles in the Chicago metropolitan area, and a 6-percent use tax on the rental price of an automobile that is rented from a renter outside Illinois, titled or registered in the state, and used in the Chicago metropolitan area. The Authority also imposes an occupation tax on persons engaged in the business of providing ground transportation to airline passengers departing from and arriving at “commercial service airports” within the Chicago metropolitan area (i.e., taxi and limousine services). Geja's Cafe v. Metropolitan Pier & Exposition Auth., 153 Ill. 2d 239, 606 N.E.2d 1212 (1992). BNA-SUTN IL 9.4.
