Local Tax Authorized A local sales and use tax may be imposed by a county or city within Kansas. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-4001. The local sales tax applies to the same transactions as the state sales tax. Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-189, as amended by 2019 Kan. H.B. 2140, effective July 1, 2019; Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-21-6.

Specifically, the local sales tax applies to sales of natural gas, electricity, heat and water delivered through mains, lines, or pipes to residential premises for noncommercial use, propane gas, coal, wood, and other fuel sources, as well as all sales of intrastate telephone and telegraph services for noncommercial uses. Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-189a; Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-21-6.

Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-189d. The local compensating use tax is applied at the same rate as the local sales tax. Also, the local use tax is identical in its application and exemptions as the state compensating use tax. All of the laws, rules, and regulations of the state Department of Revenue apply equally to the local use tax insofar as local use tax may be applicable. Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-198(a).

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Sale' and 'Retail Sale'

Defined A “sale”is the exchange of tangible personal property for consideration. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3602(kk). A “retail sale” is a sale that is made for any purpose other than for resale, sublease, or subrent. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3602(jj); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3602(kk). “Sale” includes the furnishing of electrical energy, gas, water, services, or entertainment that is taxable under Kansas law. “Sale” also includes the use of tangible personal property by way of lease, license to use, or rental. However, “sale” does not include the lease or rental of any tangible personal property as a dwelling for more than 28 consecutive days. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3602(kk). BNA-SUTN KS 1.4.1.

==================================================

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Lease'

Defined A “lease or rental” is any transfer of possession or control of tangible personal property for a fixed or indeterminate term for consideration. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3602(r). A “lease or rental”includes future options to purchase or extend a term. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3602(r). A “lease or rental”does not include a transfer of property under a security agreement or deferred payment plan that requires the transfer of title upon completion of the required payments, a transfer of property under an agreement upon completion of the required payments along with a payment of a nominal amount, or the provision of tangible personal property with an operator for a fixed or indeterminate period of time.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Use' or 'Storage, Use, or Consumption'

Defined “Use”is the exercise of any right or power over tangible personal property incident to the ownership of that property. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3702(c). “Use” does not include processing or the sale of property in the regular course of business, or the storage for subsequent use solely outside the state. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3702(c). “Storage” is the keeping or retaining of tangible personal property bought from a retailer in Kansas for any purpose, other than resale, in the regular course of business or subsequent use solely outside Kansas. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3702(d). “Storage” and “use”do not include the keeping, retaining, or the exercising of any right or power over tangible personal property shipped or brought into Kansas for subsequent use solely outside the state or being processed, fabricated, attached, manufactured into, or incorporated into other tangible personal property that will be used solely outside the state. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3702(e). For example, in the case of In re BHCMC, LLC, the taxpayer, a casino, operated electronic gaming machines owned by a state agency, the Kansas Lottery. The Kansas Supreme Court determined that the ownership of the electronic gaming machines ultimately belonged to the State Lottery, and taxpayer's use was therefore not incident to ownership and not subject to use tax. In re BHCMC, LLC, No. 911, 2017 BL 465647 (Kan. Dec. 29, 2017). BNA-SUTN KS 1.4.3.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Retailer' or 'Vendor'

Defined In Kansas, a “retailer” means a seller regularly engaged in the business of selling, leasing, or renting tangible personal property at retail and selling only to the user or consumer and not for resale. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3602(ii). “Retailer”also includes sellers regularly engaged in the business of furnishing electrical energy, gas, water, services or entertainment to the user or consumer. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3602(ii). Additionally, a “retailer"means every person engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property for “use.” However, when deemed necessary for efficient administration in the opinion of the director, the director may regard any salesperson, representatives, truckers, peddlers or canvassers as the agents of the dealers, distributors, supervisors, employers, or persons under whom they operate or from whom they obtain the tangible personal property sold by them, irrespective of whether they are making sales on their own behalf or on behalf of such dealers, distributors, supervisors, employers, or persons, the director may so regard them and may regard the dealers, distributors, supervisors, employers, or persons as retailers. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3702(g). A “seller” means a person making sales, leases or rentals of personal property or services. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3602(mm). The principal nature of a seller's business operation is immaterial in determining whether a person is a retailer. The controlling factors are whether the sale is to the final user or consumer, and whether the transaction is a sale of tangible personal property or service that is subject to tax. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-47. BNA-SUTN KS 1.4.6.
