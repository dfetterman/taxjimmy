Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

True Object Test A transaction that otherwise appears to be a bundled transaction is not a bundled transaction if the “retail sale” is essential to the use of a service and is provided exclusively in connection with a service and the true object of the transaction is the service, or if the “retail sale” is provided exclusively in connection with a second service and the true object of the transaction is a second service. North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Bulletin Section 34-25.D.1.b. In In re EarthData Int'l, Administrative Decision No. 451 (2002), a land surveying company whose corporate office was in North Carolina purchased from subcontractors aerial photography, undeveloped film, contract prints, negatives, diapositives, data tapes, compact disks, and thermal imagery. The taxpayer argued that its purchase of tangible personal property was not the “true object” of the transaction and was incidental to the professional services rendered by the subcontractors. The North Carolina Tax Review Board concluded that the taxpayer purchased tangible personal property for use in providing nontaxable aerial topographical services, and therefore, was subject to use taxes.

Entire Bundle Taxable North Carolina's sales and use tax generally applies to the entire sales price of a bundled transaction. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4D. A bundled transaction is a retail sale of two or more distinct and identifiable products, when at least one of the products is taxable and one of the products is exempt from tax, and the sale is made for one nonitemized price. The term does not apply to real property and services to real property. Products are not sold for one nonitemized price if an invoice or another sales document made available to the purchaser separately identifies the price of each product. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.3(1i), as amended by 2017 N.C. S.B. 628, effective Jan. 1, 2017. A bundled transaction does not include the retail sale of any of the following:• a product and any packaging item that accompanies the product when the packaging is exempt under the exemption provided for packaging items; N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.3(1i)(a), as amended by 2017 N.C. S.B. 628, effective Jan. 1, 2017. • a sale of two or more products whose combined price varies, or is negotiable, depending on the products a purchaser selects; N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.3(1i)(b), as amended by 2017 N.C. S.B. 628, effective Jan. 1, 2017. • a sale of a product accompanied by a transfer of another product with no additional consideration; N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.3(1i)(c), as amended by 2017 N.C. S.B. 628, effective Jan. 1, 2017. • a product and the delivery or installation of the product; N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.3(1i)(d), as amended by 2017 N.C. S.B. 628, effective Jan. 1, 2017. and • a product and any service necessary to complete the sale. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.3(1i)(e), as amended by 2017 N.C. S.B. 628, effective Jan. 1, 2017. The term “bundled transaction” does not apply to real property and services to real property. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.3(1i); North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Form E-505 (09-17). Tax does not apply to the entire sales price of a bundled transaction if the conditions described below exist. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4D. Fifty Percent Test Tax will not apply if all the following requirements are met:• all of the products in the bundle are tangible personal property; • the bundle includes one or more of the following exempt products: o food that is exempt under N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.13B;or o a drug that is exempt under N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.13(13); or o medical devices, equipment, or supplies that are exempt under N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.13(12); and • the price of the taxable products in the bundle does not exceed 50 percent of the price of the bundle. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4D(a)(1); North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Bulletin Section 34-25.C.1. When Allocation of Tax to Portions of the Bundle is Allowed Sales and use tax applies to the sales price of a bundled transaction unless the bundle includes a service and the retailer determines an allocated price for each product in the bundle based on a reasonable allocation of revenue that is supported by the retailer's business records kept in the ordinary course of business. In this circumstance, tax applies to the allocated price of each taxable product in the bundle. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4D(a)(2); N.C. Sales and Use Technical Bulletin 34-25.C.2. If a taxable telecommunications service is bundled with a service that is not taxable, then tax applies to the gross receipts from the taxable service in the bundle as follows:• If a service provider offers all of the services in the bundle on an unbundled basis, tax is due on the unbundled price of the taxable service, less the discount resulting from the bundling. The discount for a service as the result of bundling is the proportionate price decrease of the service, determined on the basis of the total unbundled price of all the services in the bundle compared to the bundled price of the services. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4D(a)(2); N.C. Sales and Use Technical Bulletin 34-25.C.3. • If a service provider does not offer one or more of the services in the bundle on an unbundled basis, tax is due on the taxable service based on a reasonable allocation of revenue to this service. If the service provider maintains an account for revenue from a taxable service, the service provider's allocation of revenue to that service for the purpose of determining the tax due on the service must reflect its accounting allocation of revenue to that service. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4D(a)(2). Ten Percent Test If the Fifty Percent and Allocation tests do not apply and if the price of a taxable product in the bundle does not exceed 10 percent of the price of the bundle, then tax does not apply to the sales price of the bundled transaction. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4D(a)(3); N.C. Sales and Use Technical Bulletin 34-25.C.3. A retailer of a bundled transaction may use either the retailer's cost price or the retailer's sales price to determine whether the transaction meets any of the tests described above. If the Ten Percent Test is used and the bundle includes a service contract, the retailer must use the full term of the contract in determining whether the transaction meets the test. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4D(b); N.C. Sales and Use Technical Bulletin 34-25.C.4. BNA-SUTN NC 9.3.2.
