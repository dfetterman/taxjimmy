Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-702(a)(1) as added by 2007 Tenn. S.B. 2223, §164, effective July 1, 2009, as amended by 2019 Tenn. H.B. 931, effective April 12, 2019 (extending Tennessee's compliance with SSUTA until July 1, 2021). Incorporated cities or towns may levy a sales and use tax through ordinance authorized by the governing body. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-702(a)(1) as added by 2007 Tenn. S.B. 2223, §164, effective July 1, 2009, as amended by 2019 Tenn. H.B. 931, effective April 12, 2019 (extending Tennessee's compliance with SSUTA until July 1, 2021). A local sales and use tax will create a local tax jurisdiction. “Local tax jurisdiction”means a geographic area where the same local option tax, either county tax or a combination of county and municipal tax, applies. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-102(51) (effective July 1, 2021, the definition for “local tax jurisdiction”is located in Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-102(53)). Voters must approve a resolution or ordinance that proposes to levy a sales and use tax. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-705(a); Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-706(a)(1). Furthermore, voters must approve a proposed amendment to an existing sales and use tax. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-705(c). An existing local sales and use tax must be amended in the same manner it was adopted (through ordinance or resolution). Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-705(c). Voters may petition the legislative body or governing body of a county, city, or town to levy a sales and use tax. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-707(1). A petition to levy a sales and use tax in a county, city or, town must be signed by at least 10 percent of the total number of registered voters in the taxing jurisdiction on the date the petition is filed with a county clerk or chief clerical officer of the city or town. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-707(2). A local sales and use tax ordinance or resolution may be repealed, but if it is repealed, it must be repealed in the same manner in which it was adopted (e.g. through ordinance or resolution and voter approval). Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-709. Water Rates: For water sold to or used by manufacturers at the state tax rate of 1 percent as authorized in §67-6-206, the local tax will be imposed at the rate of one third of one percent whenever the local tax rate does not exceed 1 percent and at the rate of 0.5 percent whenever the local rate exceeds 1 percent. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-702(b) as added by 2007 Tenn. S.B. 2223, §164, effective July 1, 2009, and as amended by 2019 Tenn. H.B. 931, effective April 12, 2019 (extending Tennessee's compliance with SSUTA until July 1, 2021). Motor Vehicle Rentals: Certain counties may levy an additional 2 percent tax on gross proceeds derived from the lease or rental of any motor vehicle, truck, or trailer that is leased or rented by a motor vehicle rental business. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-4-1907(a). Tennessee law authorizes counties, incorporated cities, and towns to levy a sales and use tax that applies in the same manner as the state sales and use tax on transactions occurring within that county, city, or town. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-702(a)(1) as added by 2007 Tenn. S.B. 2223, §164, effective July 1, 2009, as amended by 2019 Tenn. H.B. 931, effective April 12, 2019 (extending Tennessee's compliance with SSUTA until July 1, 2021); Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-202, as amended by 2019 Tenn. H.B. 931, effective April 12, 2019 (extending Tennessee's compliance with SSUTA until July 1, 2021). See also Mast Adv. & Pub., Inc. v. Moyers, 865 S.W.2d 900 (Tenn. 1993) (held that the elements of a taxable sale are (1) transfer of title or possession, or both, of (2) tangible personal property, for (3) consideration). Rate Range Any locally imposed sales and use tax may not exceed 2.75 percent. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-702(a)(1) as added by 2007 Tenn. S.B. 2223, §164, effective July 1, 2009, as amended by 2019 Tenn. H.B. 931, effective April 12, 2019 (extending Tennessee's compliance with SSUTA until July 1, 2021); Tennessee Dept. of Rev., Local Tax Rate List (Feb. 1, 2017). The levy of a sales and use tax at the county level precludes a city or town within the county from enacting a sales and use tax at rate that when combined with the county tax rate would exceed 2.75 percent. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-703(a)(1). Therefore, a city or town may only enact a sales and use tax at a rate equal to the difference between the sales and use tax rate of the county where the city or town is located and the maximum 2.75 percent local sales and use tax. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-703(a)(1). A city or town located within two counties may impose a sales or use tax equal to the difference between the lowest operative county rate (based on counties in which the city or town is located) and the 2.75 percent maximum local sales and use tax. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-703(a)(2). However, when a city or town located in more than one county has a sales and use tax rate that when combined with the tax rate of a county where it sits causes the maximum local rate to exceed 2.75 percent, only the tax equaling the difference between the county rate and the maximum local rate will apply in the territory of the town or city located in the county where the maximum local rate would be exceeded. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-703(a)(2). In addition to the local option sales and use tax, Tennessee authorizes local taxes on hotels, motels, and tourist accommodations. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-4-1402(a); Tenn. Code Ann. §7-4-102(a)(1); Tenn. Code Ann. §7-4-102(a)(2). Remote Sales Effective Oct. 1, 2019, out-of-state dealers may no longer elect to apply a standard 2.25 percent local rate in place of the specific local sales tax rate in effect for the jurisdiction into which a sale is shipped or delivered. Instead, out-of-state dealers must apply the specific local sales tax rate in effect for the city or county jurisdiction into which the sale was shipped or delivered. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-702(f), as repealed by 2019 Tenn. H.B. 326, effective Oct. 1, 2019; Tennessee Notice No. 19-05 (June 2019). BNA-SUTN TN 1.1.3.

Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Excise and Replacement Taxes

Yes Excise Taxes Tennessee imposes several types of excise taxes such as the gasoline tax, tobacco tax, and the hotel occupancy tax. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-3-201 (gasoline tax); Tenn. Code Ann. §67-4-1002 (tobacco tax); Tenn. Code Ann. §67-4-1402 (hotel occupancy tax). Replacement Taxes The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement prohibits member states from imposing a “prohibited replacement tax” which is a tax outside of the sales and use tax that is imposed on products defined in the Agreement. Generally, the Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board will make a finding regarding whether or not a member state has imposed a replacement tax. Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, as amended through Dec. 14, 2018, Section 334 and Rule 334 of the Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board; Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board Rules and Procedures, as amended through May 3, 2018; see 2019 Tenn. H.B. 931, effective April 12, 2019 (extending Tennessee's compliance with SSUTA until July 1, 2021). Tennessee is an associate member of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, but not a full member, which means the state substantially complies with the SSUTA taken as a whole, but not necessarily with each provision. Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, State Info; see 2019 Tenn. H.B. 931, effective April 12, 2019 (extending Tennessee's compliance with SSUTA until July 1, 2021).
