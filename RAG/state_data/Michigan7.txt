Depends Items used or consumed by a restaurant or other food establishment in operation of the business are taxable. Such items include utensils, cookware, dishes, glassware utensils, tablecloths, dishwashers, and stoves. Michigan Letter Ruling LR 1987-32 (May 12, 1987). Items that become an ingredient or component part of the prepared food or beverage may be purchased tax exempt as a sale for resale. Items in this category would include all carry-out or to-go containers, paper napkins, wetnaps, doggie bags, foam cups/containers, lids, and straws. Michigan Letter Ruling LR 1987-32 (May 12, 1987). Local governments in Michigan are prohibited from imposing an additional tax on “auxiliary containers” and from regulating the use, disposition, or sale of auxiliary containers. Therefore, although containers such as bags and to-go containers are subject to sales tax, localities may not impose any additional tax or fee on containers (e.g., a $0.05 tax on the use of plastic bags) or ban their use. 2016 Mich. S.B. 853, effective March 28, 2017. “Auxiliary containers” include bags, cups, bottles, and other packaging that meet both of the following requirements:• are made of cloth, paper, plastic, cardboard, corrugated material, aluminium, glass, post-consumer recycled material, or similar materials, including coated, laminated, or multi-layered substances; and • are designed for transporting, consuming, or protecting merchandise, food, or beverages from or at a food service or retail facility. 2016 Mich.
