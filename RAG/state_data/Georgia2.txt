Topic: Administration and Procedure Vendor/Seller Registration

Required A vendor or seller must file an application for a certificate of registration for each place of business. Likewise, every person who contracts to furnish tangible personal property and perform services in constructing, altering, remodeling, or improving property within the State of Georgia is required to file an application for a certificate of registration. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-59(a)(1); Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-1-.09(2). Each certificate of registration that is issued must be conspicuously displayed at the corresponding place of business. Certificates of registration are not transferable and may only be used at the place designated on the certificate. However, each person whose business spans two or more counties within the state is required to secure only one certificate of registration. This certificate will cover all the business operations throughout Georgia. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-59; Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-1-.09(4) – Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-1-.09(5). All dealers conducting business in Georgia are required to register for a sales and use tax number regardless of whether they make only exempt sales into Georgia. Georgia Letter Ruling LR SUT-2018-10-Software (Aug. 7, 2018). The Department of Revenue may revoke a taxpayer's certificate of registration if any of the following occur:• the taxpayer fails to file required returns; • the taxpayer files a false or fraudulent return; • the taxpayer fails to collect or remit the required tax; and • the taxpayer provides materially false information in the application for a certificate of registration or fails to inform the Department of a material change to the information provided in such application. Ga. Comp. R. Regs. r. 560-12-1-.37(4). BNA-SUTN GA 31.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Tax Collection and Remittance

Vendor In Georgia, every purchaser of tangible personal property at retail is liable for sales tax on the purchase. Furthermore, the owner of property purchased out-of-state is deemed a dealer upon the first instance of use, consumption, distribution, or storage of the property within Georgia and is liable for use tax. No retail sale is taxable to the retailer or dealer if it is not taxable to the purchaser at retail. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-30(b)and (c). Vendor/Seller Liability Dealers must collect sales and use tax from purchasers or consumers at the time of the sale or purchase. Dealers are required to remit the sums collected directly to the Commissioner as provided by law. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-33. Dealers who fail to collect the appropriate amount of sales and use tax are liable for, and must pay, the deficient amount. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-35. Dealers are also liable for stolen, lost, or misplaced taxes, regardless of fault. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-30; Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-33; Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-34(a); Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-35; Georgia Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-1-.30. BNA-SUTN GA 31.3.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Purchaser Liability

Yes In Georgia, every purchaser of tangible personal property at retail is liable for sales tax on the purchase. Furthermore, the owner of property purchased out-of-state is deemed a dealer upon the first instance of use, consumption, distribution, or storage of the property within Georgia and is liable for use tax. No retail sale is taxable to the retailer or dealer if it is not taxable to the purchaser at retail. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-30(b)and (c). Use tax is imposed on certain services and tangible personal property purchased outside of Georgia for use and consumption within Georgia. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-34(b). BNA-SUTN GA 31.3.2.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Business Owners, Operators

Yes A corporate officer responsible for collecting or paying sales tax may be personally liable for any deficient amounts if he or she willfully fails to collect taxes; fails to truthfully account for and pay taxes to the Commissioner; or willfully attempts to evade an obligation imposed by law. Ga. Code Ann. §48-2-52(a); Ga. Dept. of Rev. v. Moore, 2013 BL 304310 (Ga. 2013). Successor Liability A dealer's successor or assignees must withhold a sufficient amount of the purchase money to cover the amount of taxes, interest, and penalties due and unpaid, until the former owner produces either:• a receipt from the Commissioner showing that the taxes, interest, and penalties have been paid, or • a certificate from the Commissioner stating that no sales and use taxes, interest, or penalties are due. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-46. Failure of a successor to withhold the required amount will result in the successor's personal liability. Successors are not relieved from this liability even if the Department of Revenue fails to record a lien against the seller's business. Therefore, the responsibility of inquiring into a seller's tax liability rests solely on the potential buyer. Furthermore, successors do not need to buy all of the business assets to incur liability for the tax. Sales of inventory, fixtures, furniture, vehicles and equipment can constitute a sale of the “stock and goods or equipment.” JD Design Group Inc. v. Graham, 646 S.E.2d 227 (Ga. 2007). There is no statute of limitations on successor liability and any personal liability imposed upon the successor is subject to the original statute of limitations period that began once the tax was properly assessed against the original taxpayer.

However, Georgia will grant taxpayers a credit against the taxpayer's Georgia use tax liability equal to any amount of sales or use tax previously paid to another state. If the amount of sales or use tax previously paid to another state is not sufficient to cover the use tax due in Georgia, the taxpayer will be required to pay an amount equal to the difference between the two taxes to the Georgia Department of Revenue. Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-1-.32(1)and (3). Dealers who import or cause to be imported tangible personal property from other states or foreign countries for use or consumption in Georgia must file use tax returns relating to the imported tangible personal property and pay the use tax to the Georgia Department of Revenue.

An exemption certificate is accepted in good faith when the seller obtains from the purchaser:• a certificate that is fully completed; • a certificate that is in a form appropriate for the type of exemption claimed; • a certificate claiming an exemption that is statutorily available on the date of the transaction in the jurisdiction to which the transaction is sourced; • a certificate that is claiming an exemption that could be applicable to the item being purchased; and • a certificate that is claiming an exemption that is reasonable for the purchaser's type of business. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-38(b); see Georgia Letter Ruling SUT 2017-16 Exemption Documentation (Nov. 30, 2017). For resale certificates, good faith additionally requires that the seller acquires a properly completed certificate from the purchaser and that:• the purchaser is engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property; • the purchaser has a valid sales tax registration number at the time of purchase and includes that registration number on the certificate;and • the seller has no reason to believe that the purchaser does not intend to resell the items purchased in his or her regular course of business. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-38(c); see Georgia Letter Ruling SUT 2017-16 Exemption Documentation (Nov. 30, 2017). Prior to March 5, 2013, sellers were relieved of liability for transactions when they accepted fully completed exemption certificates from manufacturers. After March 5, 2013, all sellers must exercise good faith when accepting exemption certificates. Georgia Letter Ruling SUT 2013-10-04-01 Documentation Issues (Oct. 4, 2013). BNA-SUTN GA 31.8.4.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Direct Pay Permits

Authorized When the Commissioner deems it impractical or inequitable for a taxpayer to pay sales and use tax separately, the taxpayer may be given a direct-pay permit. Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-1-.16. Prior to Jan. 1, 2017, there is no state specific application form. Instead, the permit is obtained by a written application whereby the taxpayer obligates itself to report and pay sales and use taxes on all taxable purchases of property and services directly to the Commissioner. Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-1-.16. However, permits issued prior to Dec. 31, 2016 that are not issued through the Georgia Tax Center will expire and cannot be used to make purchases after that date. Direct pay permits issued through the Tax Center will become effective on Jan. 1, 2017, or the date of issuance, whichever is later. Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-1-.16(2), effective April 24, 2016. Taxpayers must satisfy the following conditions to obtain a direct pay permit through the Georgia Tax Center:• have purchased more than $2 million of tangible personal property in the 12 months prior to the application, or have purchased an annual average amount exceeding $2 million of tangible personal property during the 36 months prior to the application; • be classified on the previous year's federal income tax return under one of nine North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)codes: ○ National Industry Code 517110 - Wired Telecommunications Carriers, ○ National Industry Code 517210 - Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite), ○ National Industry Code 517410 - Satellite Telecommunications, ○ NAICS Industry Code 48111 - Scheduled Air Transportation, ○ NAICS Industry Code 48211 - Rail Transportation, ○ Industry Group Code 4841 - General Freight Trucking, ○ Economic Sector Code 21 - Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction, ○ Economic Sector Code 22 - Utilities, or ○ Economic Sector Codes 31 - 33, Manufacturing. • complete the application form online; • agree to waive interest on refunds of sales and use tax remitted for purchases made on or after Jan. 1, 2017 without the payment of tax to a vendor;and • attest that the taxpayer can comply with sales and use tax laws and reporting requirements, is not delinquent on any tax filings, that direct payment will benefit the taxpayer's compliance and reduce administrative work regarding collection, verification, calculation or remittance of the tax, and that direct payment will improve overall compliance and result in improved accuracy. Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-1-.16(3), effective April 24, 2016. Beginning Jan. 1, 2017, taxpayers permitted to report under this rule will furnish each seller of tangible personal property or taxable services with a photographic copy of its permit, unless the taxpayer has previously furnished the permit to the vendor and that permit if valid at the time of re-application. Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-1-.16(7), effective April 24, 2016. Direct pay permits may not be used for the following beginning Jan. 1, 2017:• purchases of fuel subject to prepaid local tax defined in Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-2; • purchases of meals, beverages or tobacco; • purchases of local telephone services, transportation of persons, or lodging accommodations and associated ancillary charges; • purchases of admissions to places of amusement, entertainment, athletic events, displays or exhibitions, participation in games or sports, or charges for amusement devices; and • rental charges for periods of 31 or fewer consecutive days of motor vehicles.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Record-Keeping Requirements

3 Years Georgia law requires every vendor to maintain sales records for a period of no less than three years. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-52(a)(1); Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-1-.23. Vendors are required to keep and preserve:• suitable records of taxable sales and purchases; • other books of account which are necessary to determine the amount of tax due; • other information as required by the Commissioner; • a complete inventory of the stock on hand and it value, taken at least once a year; and • for a period of three years, all invoices and other records of goods, ware, merchandise, and other taxable items. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-52(a)(1); Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-1-.23. All records and books must be available for examination by the Commissioner or any of his authorized agents. If the vendor has imported tangible personal property and did not keep adequate records, the Commissioner will determine the purchase price in any manner and then assess and collect the tax on the true purchase price of the property. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-52. Wholesale Dealer Records Every wholesale dealer or jobber in Georgia must keep a record of all sales of tangible personal property made in Georgia whether the sales are for cash or on terms of credit. The record must contain the name and address of the purchaser, the date of the purchase, the article purchase, and the price at which the article is sold to the purchaser. The records are to be kept for three years and open to inspection by the Commissioner or any of his authorized agents. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-53. BNA-SUTN GA 31.9.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Refunds

Both A dealer may file a claim for refund of erroneously or illegally assessed and collected taxes within the three-year statute of limitations from the date of payment of tax. Ga. Code Ann. §48-2-35(c). In order to secure a refund, a dealer must affirmatively show that the tax was paid by the dealer and not by the consumer or that such tax was collected from the consumer as tax and will be refunded to the consumer before the dealer receives the refund from the state. The Supreme Court of Georgia has ruled that the term “secure a refund” should not be construed to mean “apply for a refund” but rather means “acquire a repayment.”Based on this construction, a dealer is not required to repay funds prior to filing a refund claim on behalf of its consumers, but must repay funds prior to receiving repayment from the state. Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-1-.25(2). See, e.g. New Cingular Wireless Pcs. LLC v. Georgia Dept. of Rev., Ga. Ct. App., No. S17G1256., 2018 BL 132688, April 16, 2018, reversing in part, vacating in part, and remanding with direction New Cingular Wireless Pcs. LLC v. Georgia Dept. of Rev., Ga. Ct. App., No. A16A2003., 2017 BL 52012, Feb. 21, 2017. Dealers should use Form ST-12 to request a refund. Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-3-.17. Taxpayers required to file and pay their taxes electronically must also file refund claims electronically. Ga. Code Ann. §48-2-35(g), as added by 2015 Ga. H.B. 960, effective July 1, 2016; Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-3-2-.26(7)(d), effective July 1, 2016. See Georgia Policy Bulletin SUT-2016-02. In addition, any person that has mistakenly or illegally paid sales taxes to a dealer that remitted the taxes to the state may file a claim for refund either initially with the commissioner or, alternatively, elect to seek a refund from the dealer, by submitting a written request for refund to the dealer, and file a claim for refund with the commissioner after being unable to obtain a refund from such dealer. The taxpayer must submit a notarized form attesting to the fact that the dealer will not seek a refund or credit of the taxes at issue. The dealer must also agree to provide all of the necessary documentation to verify that the dealer has remitted the tax at issue to the state. Ga. Code Ann. §48-2-35.1(d), as amended by 2013 Ga. S.B. 137, effective May 6, 2013. Cause of Action If a claim is denied or is not decided by the Commissioner within one year from the date of filing the claim, resident taxpayers may file a cause of action in a Superior Court of the county in which the taxpayer resides. Public utilities and nonresidents may file a cause of action in the county in which the taxpayer's principle place of business, or office of the highest corporate employee, within the state is located. Nonresident individuals and foreign corporations may only file a cause of action within Fulton County or in the Superior Court of the county in which the Commissioner in office at the time of the action is filed resides. Ga. Code Ann. §48-2-35(c)(4). No action or proceeding may be brought for the recovery of a refund before one year passes from the date of filing a claim for such refund, unless the Commissioner or the Commissioner's delegate renders a decision on the claim for refund within the year's time. Furthermore, no action or proceeding may be commenced after the later of:• the expiration of two years from the date the claim for refund was denied; or • if a valid protest is filed protesting the denial of the refund, 30 days after the Department of Revenue's ruling on such protest. Ga. Code Ann. §48-2-35(c)(6)(A). However, the statute of limitations may be extended by a time mutually agreeable to both the taxpayer and the Commissioner of Revenue. Such agreement must be in writing and be completed prior to the running of the statute of limitations or any extension thereto. Ga. Code Ann. §48-2-35(c)(6)(B); Collins v. Columbus Foundries Inc., 425 S.E.2d 281 (Ga. 1993). Interest on Refund Amounts Beginning July 1, 2016, all refund amounts will include interest at annual rate equal to the bank prime loan rate as posted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, plus 3 percent. Interest accrues monthly, beginning on the date the tax was paid. Prior to July 1, 2016, interest was refunded at the rate of 1 percent per month. Ga. Code Ann. §48-2-35(a), as amended by 2015 Ga. H.B. 960, effective July 1, 2016. However, if a certificate or exemption determination letter issued by the Commissioner certifying that the purchaser is entitled to purchase tangible personal property or taxable services without the payment of sales and use tax has not been obtained and used prior to purchasing such tangible personal property or taxable services, a refund of sales and use taxes will be made without interest. Ga. Code Ann. §48-2-35.1(a). The Georgia Tax Tribunal On Jan. 1, 2013, the Georgia Tax Tribunal (GTT)began its operations to handle state tax disputes that cannot be resolved informally before the Department of Revenue. The Tribunal is completely separate from and independent of the Department of Revenue and while the Tribunal may resemble a judicial court, it is actually part of the executive branch of state government. A small claims case election is available if certain threshold amounts are not exceeded. Filing a petition with the GTT generally operates as a stay of enforcement or collection activity until the case is finalized. All decisions of the Tribunal (with the exception of small claims cases) may be appealed to the Superior Court of Fulton County. Ga. Code Ann. §48-2-59, as amended by 2012 Ga. H.B. 100, effective Jan. 1, 2013 (cases pending on Jan. 1, 2013 are governed by the law in effect on Dec. 31, 2012); Ga. Code Ann. §50–13A-2, as added by 2012 Ga. H.B. 100, effective July 1, 2012 (applicable to proceedings beginning after Jan. 1, 2013). Tourism Development Refund A refund of state and local sales and use tax remitted is available to approved companies that build new tourism attractions or expand existing attractions in Georgia pursuant to the Tourism Development Act. An approved company is one that has entered an agreement with the Department of Community Affairs to undertake a Tourism Attraction Project that has opened to the public and has become operational as a tourism attraction. Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-2-.116. For new attractions, an annual sales and use tax refund is available for state and local taxes remitted during the calendar year immediately preceding the date of filing the refund claim. Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-2-.116(3)(a); Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-2-.116(2)(b). For an expansion of an existing tourism attraction, an incremental sales and use tax refund is available for taxes remitted. The incremental sales and use tax refund is calculated as the difference between a) post-expansion sales tax remitted from the date of completion of expansion construction through the end of the calendar year immediately preceding the date of filing the incremental sales and use tax refund claim, and b) pre-expansion sales tax remitted for that portion of the 12-month period preceding the commencement of expansion construction that corresponds to the post-expansion period. Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-2-.116(3)(a); Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-2-.116(2)(g). A tourism development refund is granted to an approved company for a period of ten years commencing on the date a new tourism attraction opens for business and begins collecting sales and use taxes or, for an expansion of an attraction, the date construction is completed. Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-2-.116(3)(c). BNA-SUTN GA 31.10.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Statute of Limitations Assessment of Additional Tax

3 Years Additional sales and use taxes must be assessed within three years after the return is filed. However, the taxpayer and the Commissioner may agree to extend the three year statute of limitations. Ga. Code Ann. §48-2-49(b)and (d). This agreement must be in writing, stating the duration of the additional time, and must be reached prior to the running of the statute of limitations to assess additional sales tax. This additional period may be extended, if need be, by subsequent agreements between the Commissioner and the tax payer. Furthermore, additional assessments may be made at any time if the taxpayer fails to file a return or if the taxpayer files a false or fraudulent return with the intent to evade tax. For purposes of this rule, any returns filed early are deemed filed on the last day prescribed for the filing of the return. Ga. Code Ann. §48-2-49(b)-(d). BNA-SUTN GA 31.11.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Civil Penalties

Yes Georgia may imposes a range of civil penalties for violation of the rules and regulations relating to sales and use taxes. Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-1-.22(7); Ga. Code Ann. §48-2-32(e)(1); Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-66. Untimely Filing Any return or remittance that is deemed delinquent will result in the loss of vendor's compensation and will accrue penalties and interest. Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-1-.22(7). If a dealer fails to file a return, or pay the full amount of tax, a penalty is added to the tax of 5 percent or $5, whichever is greater. This penalty accrues every 30 days, or fraction of 30 days during which the failure continues. However, the penalty for any single violation shall not exceed 25 percent or $25 in the aggregate, whichever is greater. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-66. On occasion vendors will be unable to file a timely return as the result of providential causes out of the vendor's control. In this event, the vendor should attach an affidavit to the return that sets forth the facts and circumstances relating to the failure to file. Georgia has not defined what providential causes will excuse an untimely filing. However, the statute generally states that so long as the return is filed within 10 days, and the Commissioner finds the affidavit satisfactory, the return may be accepted exclusive of penalties and interest. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-66. Bad Checks When a check or money order is not paid, a penalty of 2 percent of the amount of the check or money order is charged. If, however, the amount for the check or money order is less than$1,250 then the penalty is $25. This penalty is in addition to any other penalties provided by law. Ga. Code Ann. §48-2-32(e)(1). Good Faith Exception The bad check penalty will not apply if the vendor can establish, to the Commissioner's satisfaction, that the check or money order was tendered in good faith and with reasonable cause to believe it would be duly paid. Ga. Code Ann. §48-2-32(e)(2). False or Fraudulent Returns In the case of false or fraudulent return, a penalty of 50 percent of the tax due is assessed. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-66. Frivolous Refund Claims Any taxpayer who frivolously files a sales and use tax claim for refund will be subject to a penalty of 20 percent of the excessive amount. Generally, the most important factor in determining whether a taxpayer filed the claim for refund in good faith is the extent of the taxpayer's effort to assess the taxpayer's proper tax liability. Circumstances that may indicate good faith include an honest misunderstanding of fact or law that is reasonable in light of all the facts and circumstances relevant to the taxpayer, including experience, knowledge, and education. Further, an isolated computational or transcriptional error generally is not inconsistent with good faith. Ga. Code Ann. §48-2-35.1(c)(2). Collection Costs The Department will assess a collection fee equaling 20 percent of the assessed liability, in addition to other penalties and fees, when issuing a Notice of State Tax Execution. Ga. Code Ann. §48-16-10(a); Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-1-2-.02. BNA-SUTN GA 31.12.1.

Code Ann. §48-8-9. Tax Absorption No retailer may represent to the public, directly or indirectly, that the vendor will either absorb all or any part of the tax due upon sale, or relieve the purchaser of the payment of all or any part of the tax imposed under law. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-36. Any person who does so will be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, will be punished by a fine ranging from $25 to $250. In addition, the vendor may be imprisoned in the county jail for up to three months. Any person who is convicted of a second or subsequent violation of this rule will be punished by a fine of $500 and may be imprisoned for up to six months. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-37(b). Failure to Collect Tax Where a dealer knowingly and willfully fails or refuses to collect sales and use tax either by him- or herself or through agents, the dealer may be guilty of a misdemeanor of a high and aggravated nature. In addition to the penalty of being liable for and paying the tax, the dealer, upon conviction, may be punished with a fine of not more than $5,000 and imprisonment for not more than one year. Subsequent convictions will be for a felony and may result in a fine up to $10,000 or imprisonment for up to five years, or both. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-7. Failure to File a Return It is unlawful for any dealer to knowingly and willfully fail or refuse to furnish a return, supplemental return, or other data required by the commissioner. Vendors who fail to furnish the required return materials may be guilty of a misdemeanor of a high and aggravated nature. If convicted, the dealer may be punished with a fine of not more than $5,000 and may be imprisoned for up to one year, or both. Subsequent convictions will be for a felony and may result in a fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment up to five years, or both. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-9. Additionally, a penalty of 50 percent of the tax due may be assessed, which is payable to the Department of Revenue. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-66. Failure to Keep Records If a dealer, wholesale dealer, or jobber fails to keep records or open its records for inspection the dealer may be guilty of a misdemeanor. Ga. Code Ann. §§48-8-53, 54. Frivolous Refund Claims Any taxpayer who frivolously files a sales and use tax claim for refund will be subject to a penalty of 20 percent of the excessive amount. Generally, the most important factor in determining whether a taxpayer filed the claim for refund in good faith is the extent of the taxpayer's effort to assess the taxpayer's proper tax liability. Ga. Code Ann. §48-2-35.1(c)(2). Circumstances that may indicate good faith include an honest misunderstanding of fact or law that is reasonable in light of all the facts and circumstances relevant to the taxpayer, including experience, knowledge, and education. Further, an isolated computational or transcriptional error generally is not inconsistent with good faith. Ga. Code Ann. §48-2-35.1(c)(2). Refund Claims Filed in Bad Faith In addition to penalties imposed for frivolous refunds, when all or part of the excessive amount of the claim for refund is based upon a position which is knowingly and willfully advanced in bad faith and is patently improper, the taxpayer is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, may be punished by a fine up to$1,000.

Yes Effective Jan. 1, 2011, Georgia became an associate member of the Streamlined Sales Tax Agreement. Under this Agreement, a seller who registered to pay or to collect and remit applicable sales or use tax on sales made to purchasers in Georgia in accordance with the terms of the Agreement was relieved from the obligation to remit uncollected sales tax, provided that the seller was not registered to collect and remit sales or use tax in Georgia in the 12-month period preceding the effective date of the state's participation in the Agreement. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-76(a)-(f);Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Important Documents, Georgia. This amnesty precluded an assessment for uncollected or unpaid sales tax together with penalty or interest for sales made during the period the seller was not registered in the state, provided that the registration occurred within 12 months of the effective date of the state's participation in the agreement. This amnesty relief was subject to the following provisions:• Amnesty was not available to a seller with respect to any matter for which the seller received notice of the commencement of an audit which had to be resolved, including any related administrative and judicial processes. • Amnesty was not available with regard to sales or use taxes already paid or remitted to Georgia or to taxes collected by the seller. • Amnesty was fully effective, absent fraud or intentional misrepresentation, so long as the seller continued registration and continued payment or collection and remittance of applicable sales or use taxes for a period of at least 36 months. The statute of limitations applicable to asserting a tax liability was tolled during this 36 month period. • Amnesty was only applicable to sales or use taxes due from a seller in its capacity as a seller and not to sales or use taxes due from a seller in its capacity as a buyer. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-76(a)-(f);Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Important Documents, Georgia. While it may have been to a seller's benefit to take advantage of amnesty in Georgia, it could have resulted in exposure in other states. A Voluntary Disclosure Agreement may have provided the same benefits as participation in the amnesty program. If a company did not participate in the Georgia amnesty program, the company would've had to register and comply with other states participating in the Streamlined Sales Tax Agreement.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Voluntary Disclosure Relief

Yes The Georgia Department of Revenue has implemented a voluntary disclosure program. See Georgia Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Agreements (last visited Oct. 1, 2018). The voluntary disclosure program is administered by the Department of Revenue's Compliance Research Unit. To determine if a person is eligible for the program, the Department requires a look-back period. A look-back period is normally three years, but it depends on the nature of the company's or individual's activities and the size of past year's potential tax liabilities submitted on the application. Whether the penalties for taxes due for the period of non-filing are waived depends on the certainty of nexus, the size of the liability, and the explanation for the failure to file. However, the interest on the amount due for taxes for the look-back period cannot be waived. See Georgia Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Agreements (last visited Oct. 1, 2018). BNA-SUTN GA 31.15.1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Voluntary Disclosure Look-Back Periods

3 years The Georgia look-back period will usually be for a minimum of three years for all tax types. However, the length of the look-back period will depend on the nature of the company's activities and the size of past years' potential tax liabilities as submitted in the application. For corporate income tax, the look-back period also depends upon the existence of a net operating loss during the period. Ga. Code Ann. §48-2-49;Georgia Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Agreements (last visited Oct. 1, 2018). BNA-SUTN GA 31.15.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Voluntary Disclosure Multistate Tax Commission (MTC) Program

Participates Georgia participates in the Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program (MVDP)which allows taxpayers with outstanding tax liabilities in multiple states to negotiate settlements via a process coordinated by the National Nexus Program (NNP) staff of the MTC. Multistate Tax Commission, Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program. To participate in the MVDP, the taxpayer must:• have a minimum good-faith tax liability estimate of $500 or more; • not have been contacted by a state or commission regarding taxes due;and • submit a completed Voluntary Disclosure Agreement (VDA) including taxpayer's contact information, tax year, list of states to receive the proposed VDA, description of taxpayer's activities in each state, and estimate of taxes due. Multistate Tax Commission, Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program. Georgia may have additional requirements for participation in the MVDP. The program is intended to incentivize taxpayers to begin filing and paying taxes in all of the states in which they have substantial nexus. Upon entering into a voluntary disclosure agreement with a state, taxpayers will be required to file returns, pay the tax due and accrued interest on the returns, and register with the state in exchange for waiver of penalties for the entire look-back period. Taxpayers are not charged to participate in the MVDP. BNA-SUTN GA 31.15.3.
