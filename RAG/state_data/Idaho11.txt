Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Sales Tax

Yes The Idaho sales tax is an excise tax that applies to the sales price of each sale at retail and to specified services. Idaho Code §63-3619. The Idaho sales tax applies to sales for all purposes other than resale sales, leases, or rentals in the regular course of business. Taxable sales include any transfer of title, exchange, barter, or transfer of possession of tangible personal property for consideration. Also included is any transaction involving the transfer of possession of property with title remaining with the seller as security. Idaho Code §63-3609; Idaho Code §63-3612(1); Idaho Code §63-3612(2)(c); Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.011. A presumption exists that all sales are taxable and that tangible personal property shipped or brought into the state of Idaho by a purchaser is to be stored, used, or otherwise consumed in Idaho. Idaho Code §63-3621(h); Idaho Code §63-3621(i); see also Gracie, LLC v. Idaho State Tax Comn., 237 P.3d 1196, 2010 BL 146708 (Idaho 2010). The burden of proving that a sale is not subject to tax is on the seller. Idaho Code §63-3621(e); Idaho Code §63-3622(a). The legal incidence of the sales tax is on the consumer. However, retailers are responsible for collecting the sales tax. Idaho Code §63-3619(b); Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.068.02; Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.068.07. Idaho prohibits retailers from advertising or holding out that they will assume or absorb sales tax, or that sales tax will not be added to the sales price. Idaho Code §63-3619(d). Once collected, sales tax becomes “state money,”and at no point belongs to the retailer.

Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Use Tax

Yes The Idaho use tax is an excise tax that applies to the privilege of storing, using, or consuming tangible personal property in Idaho. Idaho Code §63-3621; Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.072(01). The Idaho use tax is also imposed on property purchased outside of Idaho or from a retailer not subject to Idaho's jurisdiction, if that item is used, stored, or consumed in Idaho. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.072.06. Although a purchaser storing, using, or otherwise consuming tangible personal property in Idaho is responsible for remitting the use tax, a retailer engaged in business in Idaho is charged with collecting the tax from the purchaser. Idaho Code §63-3621(b). The use tax is imposed upon the value of tangible personal property. A recent sales price is evidence of the value. In the absence of a recent sales price, the value of the property will be the fair market value at the time of first use in the state. Special rules apply for property present in the state for a cumulative period of time totaling not more than 90 days in any consecutive 12-month period. Idaho Code §63-3621A; see Idaho Commission Decisions Docket No. 1-075-163-136 (April 27, 2017). The use tax is inapplicable when the sales tax is paid to the retailer for property purchased from an Idaho retailer. Idaho Code §63-3621(c); Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.072.05. Consumers who make purchases online, by telephone, or by mail order catalogue are responsible for remitting use tax for purchases, if the seller does not collect sales tax. Use tax may be paid when the consumer files an annual tax return or by filing an Idaho Individual Income Tax Return. Idaho Sales and Use Tax Publication 2. A retailer engaged in business in Idaho is required to file an application for a seller's permit with the State Tax Commission prior to conducting business in Idaho. Idaho Code §63-3620(a); Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.070. The Idaho State Tax Commission is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the sales and use taxes. The State Tax Commission may prescribe and adopt rules and regulations and may delegate duties to deputies and employees that act on behalf of the State Tax Commission. Idaho Code §63-3038; Idaho Code §63-3039; Idaho Code §63-3624(a); Idaho Code §63-3635. The Idaho legislature is authorized by the state constitution to raise revenue and impose taxes on persons doing business in Idaho. Idaho Const. art. VII, §2. BNA-SUTN ID 1.1.2.

Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Local Option Sales and Use Tax

Local Tax Authorized The Idaho legislature has provided the authority for certain counties, special authorities, and districts to levy local sales and use taxes in limited circumstances. See, e.g., Idaho Code §50-1044. Current Local Sales Tax Authority A local sales tax can be imposed upon part or all of the sales subject to taxation at the state level. Idaho Code §50-1046(c). Subject to approval by 60 percent of voters, cities that derive a major portion of their economic well-being from tourism may impose an occupancy tax on hotel and other sleeping accommodations for a period of 30 days or less. Idaho Code §50-1044; Idaho Code §50-1048; Idaho Code §50-1046(a). The occupancy tax rate ranges from 0.5 percent to 5 percent amongst local taxing jurisdictions. Idaho Code §67-4917B. Further, a tax may be imposed on liquor by-the-drink, wine, and beer sold at retail for consumption on the licensed premises. Idaho Code §50-1046(b). Prior County Sales Tax Authority The state of Idaho previously authorized counties to enact local sales and use taxes. The original statutes authorizing the levy of these taxes were found by the Idaho Supreme Court to be unconstitutional. Concerned Taxpayers of Kootenai Cnty. v. Kootenai Cnty., Idaho, 137 Idaho 496, 50 P.3d 991 (Idaho 2002). In response to the court's decision, the Idaho legislature repealed these statutes and enacted a new set of statutes to allow county sales and use taxes. See generally 2003 Idaho H. 428, effective May 8, 2003. Under these new statutes, the authority to enact the county tax was only available beginning on May 8, 2003, and ending on Dec. 31, 2009. See generally 2003 Idaho H. 428, effective May 8, 2003. Any ordinance enacted under this authority could only be in effect for a period of ten years from the date it was enacted. 2003 Idaho H. 428, effective May 8, 2003 (was formerly Idaho Code §63-2602). However, a county enacting the tax had the discretion to impose the tax for less than 10 years. 2003 Idaho H. 428, effective May 8, 2003 (was formerly Idaho Code §63-2604). After Dec. 31, 2009, the authorizing statute expired. 2003 Idaho H. 428, effective May 8, 2003 (was formerly Idaho Code §63-2605). The now expired statute permitted county voters, by a two-third vote, to authorize their county government to enact a sales and use tax applicable to all items subject to the state sales and use tax. 2003 Idaho H. 428, effective May 8, 2003 (was formerly Idaho Code §63-2602). In authorizing the county government to enact an ordinance, the voters would determine the rate of the tax, the duration of the tax, and the purpose for which the tax proceeds would be used. The tax could not be imposed at a rate of greater than 0.5 percent or for a period in excess of 10 years. Moreover, the only dedicated uses of the tax proceeds could be county property tax relief and the retirement of debts for detention facility expansion. 2003 Idaho H. 428, effective May 8, 2003 (was formerly Idaho Code §63-2602). Any county sales and use tax imposition ordinance enacted prior to the expiration of the county sales and use tax authorization statute must have included the rate of the tax and the method of collection. Any county imposing a county sales and use tax must have established a property tax relief fund into which at least 50 percent of the revenue received from the county tax is deposited. 2003 Idaho H. 428, effective May 8, 2003 (was formerly Idaho Code §63-2603). Resort City Local Sales and Use Tax The state of Idaho has authorized resort city governments to enact a local sales and use tax at a rate within the city's discretion on any of the following: • part or all sales subject to state sales tax; • short-term occupancy in a hotel, motel, or other accommodation; or • the sale of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises where sold. Idaho Code §50-1044; Idaho Code §50-1045; Idaho Code §50-1046. The resort city tax has both a sales and use tax component. See Idaho Code §50-1046; see also Sun Valley City Code of Ord. tit. 3 ch. 1 §3(A)(2)(B). However, not all jurisdictions enact the use tax component. See Driggs City Code tit. 3 ch. 2 §4(A). A “resort city” is a city with a population of 10,000 or less, according to the most recent census, organized under the laws of the state, special charter, or incorporation act, that derives the major portion of its economic well-being from the business of catering to recreational needs and meeting the needs of people traveling to the city for an extended period of time. Idaho Code §50-1044; Idaho Code §50-1047. To enact the resort city local sales and use tax, 60 percent of the voters of a city seeking to impose the tax must approve the tax. Idaho Code §50-1046; Idaho Code §50-1047. BNA-SUTN ID 1.1.3.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Pending and Trending Developments

Food, Special Aircraft Food In March 2017, Idaho's legislature passed a bill providing a sales and use tax exemption for food for human consumption, which was vetoed by the governor on April 11, 2017. Idaho Legislature, House Bill 67 Information. Members of the legislature filed an action seeking a writ of mandamus to compel the Idaho Secretary of State to certify the bill as law, despite the veto. The legislators claimed that because the governor had not issued his veto by the constitutionally imposed deadline (10 days after presentment), the bill became law. The Idaho Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Secretary of State and did not issue the writ of mandamus. The court reasoned that because the bill had not been presented to the governor prior to the legislature adjourning sine die for the session, the bill was invalid regardless of the governor's actions. Nate v. Denney, 2017 BL 247829 (Idaho 2017). Special Aircraft Effective June 30, 2016, Idaho enacted legislation that exempts the sale, lease, purchase, or use of a fixed-wing aircraft, if the aircraft is primarily used as an air tactical group supervisor platform, under contract with a government entity for wildfire activity. Idaho Code §63-3622GG(5) as added by 2016 Idaho H. 540, effective June 30, 2016. Economic Nexus and Marketplace Facilitators Effective June 1, 2019, Idaho enacted legislation which imposes a tax collection and remittance requirement on remote sellers who in the previous or current calendar year have cumulative gross receipts from sales delivered into Idaho in excess of $100,000. Idaho Code §63-3611(3)(h), as added by 2019 Idaho H. 259, effective June 1, 2019. In addition, Effective June 1, 2019, marketplace facilitators must collect sales and use taxes on retail sales they facilitate if they have physical presence in Idaho or its sales combined with the sales it facilitates exceed $100,000. Idaho Code §63-3620E, as added by 2019 Idaho H. 259, effective June 1, 2019. BNA-SUTN ID 1.3.
