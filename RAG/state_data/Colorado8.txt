Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Food and Food Ingredients General Rule

Exempt The sale, storage, use, or consumption of food is exempt from Colorado sales and use tax. Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-707(1)(e); Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-707(2)(d); Colorado FYI Sales 4; see also Colorado Private Letter Ruling PLR-16-013 (April 25, 2016); Colorado Private Letter Ruling PLR-12-006 (Dec. 12, 2012). Generally, Colorado follows the United States Food and Drug Administration guidelines for determining what is classified as food. Most items that carry a Nutrition Facts label are considered exempt food items, while items that carry a Supplement Facts label are considered taxable dietary supplements. Colorado General Information Letter GIL-13-017 (May 14, 2013). For purposes of this rule, exempt food does not include: carbonated water sold in containers, chewing gum, seeds or plants to grow food, prepared salads, food items purchased from salad bars, cold sandwiches, deli trays, or hot or cold beverages served in unsealed containers that are vended through machines. Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-102(4.5), as amended by 2012 Colo. S.B. 94, effective July 1, 2012 (clarifying the definition of food so that the tax treatment of food for domestic home consumption does not change when food is marketed as convenience food); Colorado FYI Sales 4. Local Sales and Use Taxes on Food At the local level, state administered taxing jurisdictions have the option of imposing a sales and use tax upon food. If a local state administered jurisdiction elects to exempt food from the local sales and use tax, the local jurisdiction's exemption must mirror the state exemption in terms of which foods are exempt. State administered local jurisdictions also have the option to exempt food sold through vending machines from sales and use tax. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(1)(d)(I)(C); Colorado FYI Sales 4; see also Colorado Private Letter Ruling PLR-12-006 (Dec. 12, 2012). Home rule jurisdictions are not subject to the restrictions imposed upon state administered local taxing jurisdictions and are free to tax or exempt food and food products as they see fit. See Colo. Const. art. XX § 6; Colo. Rev. Stat. §30-35-201(5); DR 1002 Colorado Sales/Use Tax Rates. BNA-SUTN CO 11.1.1.

Depends Retirement Communities Beginning July 1, 2016, Colorado exempts from sales and use tax qualified sales to a retirement community of food, food products, beverages, and meals. See Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-707(1)(f)(I)(A) and Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-707(2)(e)(I)(A), as enacted by 2016 Colo. H.B. 1187 §2, effective July 1, 2016. To qualify, the items must be provided for consumption on the premises of a retirement community by the retirement community's residents. See Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-707(1)(f)(I)(A) and Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-707(2)(e)(I)(A), as enacted by 2016 Colo. H.B. 1187 §2, effective July 1, 2016. Likewise, Colorado exempts sales directly to the retirement community for those purposes. See Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-707(1)(f)(I)(B) and Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-707(2)(e)(I)(B), as enacted by 2016 Colo. H.B. 1187 §2, effective July 1, 2016. Colorado also exempts related sales of containers or bags to package the food. See Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-707(1)(f)(I)(C), Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-707(1)(f)(I)(D), Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-707(2)(e)(I)(C), and Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-707(2)(e)(I)(D), as enacted by 2016 Colo. H.B. 1187 §2, effective July 1, 2016. Colorado defines “food” for these purposes to include prepared salads, salad bars, and packaged or unpackaged sandwiches. See Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-707(1)(f)(II) and Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-707(2)(e)(II), as enacted by 2016 Colo. H.B. 1187 §2, effective July 1, 2016. Before July 1, 2016, Colorado imposed sales tax on food purchased and provided as part of a meal plan to the retirement community's residents. As 2016 Colo. H.B. 1187 recognizes, though, “[i]n general the retirement community industry has not been collecting and remitting sales or use tax for these items.” 2016 Colo. H.B. 1187 §1, effective July 1, 2016; see also Colorado Private Letter Ruling PLR-14-006 (Oct. 2, 2014) (determining that meals a retirement community provides to residents are taxable as food prepared for immediate consumption). Farmers Markets Persons engaged exclusively in the business of selling commodities that are exempt from state sales tax, such as vegetables, fruit or rice for home consumption, in state-collected tax jurisdictions are not required to get a Colorado sales tax license. However, if the farmer or retailer at a farmers market sells prepared or ready-to-eat food or other tangible property, that business should have its own Colorado sales tax license. Colorado Dept. of Rev., It's the Season for Farmers Markets. Additionally, if the location of the farmers market is in a jurisdiction that taxes food for home consumption, farmers or retailers should collect and pay the local tax either on their own sales tax license account or through the account of the market organizer if the farmer/retailer is not required to have a sales tax license. If the farmers market organizer is only collecting applicable local sales tax, because state sales tax is not required, the organizer can request to not pay the $50 state sales tax deposit normally required by the Colorado Department of Revenue for a retail sales tax license. Colorado Dept. of Rev., It's the Season for Farmers Markets. BNA-SUTN CO 11.10.
