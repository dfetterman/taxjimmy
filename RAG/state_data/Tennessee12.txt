Topic: Interstate Agreements Streamlined Sales Tax Conformity to Agreement

In Compliance On Oct. 25, 2017, the Compliance Review and Interpretations Committee issued a report finding that Tennessee was not out-of-compliance with the requirements of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement as an Associate Member State. Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, 2017 Compliance Review Report (Oct. 25, 2017); see also Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, 2016 Compliance Review Report (Nov. 22, 2016). As an Associate Member state, Tennessee substantially complies with the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement (SSUTA)taken as a whole, but not necessarily with each provision. Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, State Info. However, to further comply Tennessee addressed the issue of multiple rates by creating a “special user privilege tax” on those items that were taxed at rates different from the general rate see Tenn. Code Ann. §67-4-2301 through Tenn. Code Ann. §67-4-2307. The new tax, imposed at different rates, was to be paid by the purchaser, user, or consumer, and applied to water and energy fuel sold to manufacturers, energy purchased from a metropolitan energy resource facility, tangible personal property sold and delivered to a common carrier, diesel fuel sold to a common carrier, aviation fuel, dyed diesel fuel, and cable television and direct-to-home satellite services. In addition to providing local rate and boundary change notification requirements, Tennessee removed the single article cap which became effective January 1, 2006, except for motor vehicles, aircraft, watercraft, modular homes, and manufactured homes. Additionally, certain purchases became eligible for a refund of a portion of the additional tax attributable to the removal of the single article cap. Tennessee will become a Full Member of the SSUTA when its enacted conforming legislation takes effect. In 2007, Tennessee enacted conforming legislation that became effective for most provisions on Jan. 1, 2008, and July 1, 2008. However, additional changes remained necessary for Tennessee to comply with the SSUTA fully. The legislation that would make these changes was initially scheduled to become effective on July 1, 2009. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-801; Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-802; Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-803; Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-804; Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-805; Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-806. See Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Recertification Letter, Tennessee. Initially on June 16, 2003, Tennessee enacted S.B. 899 in order to bring the state into compliance with the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement. The streamlined changes were to take effect July 1, 2007. Tennessee enacted cleanup legislation (S.B. 3454) on June 15, 2004. Additional cleanup legislation(S.B. 2310) enacted June 22, 2005, was to take effect July 1, 2007. The bulk of Tennessee's conforming changes were scheduled to take effect July 1, 2005. However, H.B. 2088, enacted June 6, 2005, further delayed the effective date. BNA-SUTN TN 2.1.2.
