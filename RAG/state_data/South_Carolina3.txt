Topic: Utilities, Fuel, Mining and Natural Resource Extraction, Production, Sale Utilities Electricity

Depends In South Carolina, sales of electricity are included within the definition of tangible personal property and are taxable. However, sales of electricity for residential purposes are exempt from sales and use tax. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-60; S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-910(B)(2). Residential Purposes An exemption from tax applies for electricity used for residential purposes. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-2120(33); 117 S.C. Code Regs. §323. To determine the applicability of this exemption, the term “residential purposes” means any space or area occupied by one or more individuals with the intent that the space serves as a residence, house, dwelling, or abode. The exemption applies to single family houses, duplexes, condominium units, apartments, and mobile homes. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-2120(33); 117 S.C. Code Regs. §323. The exemption also applies to sales of electricity or other combustible heating materials to duplexes, condominium units, apartments, or permanent mobile homes if the fuel is centrally metered or delivered to a central storage tank (or area), and is billed as such. Under these circumstances, the fuel is considered used for residential purposes. 117 S.C. Code Regs. §323. Sales of electricity are taxable when made to hotels, motels, dormitories, summer camps, resort lodges, and nursing homes, and other temporary or transient dwellings. 117 S.C. Code Regs. §323. Tax is not imposed on any interest, fee, or other charge associated with a customer's late payment, even if the underlying electricity bill is subject to South Carolina sales tax. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-90(2)(i). “Residential” pertains to more than just a house serving as a residence. It includes a space or area connected with the house. Thus, the sales tax exemption applies to the sale of electricity to power home area lights used for security that is located on a lot where a personal home is also located. South Carolina Technical Advice Memorandum No. TAM 87-5 (April 29, 1987). Where a single family home owner has additional buildings on his property, sales of electricity for use in a pool house, storage shed, or other recreational area, each of which is separately metered, are exempt. The term “residential purposes”encompasses the entire space or area connected with the house. However, if the garage is used to conduct business, such as an auto repair shop, the separately metered electricity for the garage is subject to tax. South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 17-1 (Feb. 21, 2017). Where electricity is sold under a utility account in the name of a homeowners' association for common areas of the neighborhood or subdivision, such as guard houses or overhead lights in a parking area, or metered service to a club house, swimming pool, or tennis court, the sale is subject to tax. These common areas do not serve “as a residence, house, dwelling, or abode,” and thus, sales of electricity used for such areas are not exempt from sales and use tax. South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 17-1 (Feb. 21, 2017). With respect to sales of electricity to apartment complexes used exclusively as a residence, the following are exempt from sales and use tax:• electricity provided to individual apartment units; • electricity provided to common areas which are integral and necessary to the individual apartment units' residential use, such as hallways, parking lots, trash compactors, and entrance gates; • electricity provided to residential apartment amenities, such as laundry facilities, pool and club houses, and tennis courts, if the amenities are (1)used exclusively for domestic purposes, and (2) used only by apartment residents and their non-paying guests; and • electricity provided for use in business related areas of the apartment complex(e.g., office area, maintenance facilities, and repair facilities), if the electricity for the entire apartment complex is centrally metered and billed as such. South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 92-4 (June 1992). Taxable sales of electricity to apartment complexes used exclusively as a residence include:• electricity provided to residential apartment amenities which are available for a business purpose or available to non-residents of the apartment complex for a fee (e.g., an apartment complex that sells food and beverage in a lounge located at the complex is using the area for a business purpose); and • electricity provided for use in business related areas of the apartment complex(e.g., office area, maintenance facilities, and repair facilities), if the electricity for the entire apartment complex is not centrally metered and billed as such. South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 92-4 (June 1992). Sales of electricity to nursing homes, dormitories, healthcare facilities, and prisons are taxable, as such facilities do not constitute residences. South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 17-4 (Aug. 28, 2017). However, the application of the sales and use tax on sales of electricity to an assisted living facility is similar to the application of the sales and use tax on sales of electricity to apartment complexes. Accordingly, the following sales of electricity to an assisted living facility are exempt from sales and use tax:• electricity provided to an individual assisted living apartment in the assisted living facility; • electricity provided to common areas which are integral and necessary to the individual assisted living apartment's residential use, such as hallways, parking lots, trash compactors and entrance gates; • electricity provided to residential assisted living facility amenities, such as a pool or club house, if the amenities are (1) used exclusively for domestic purposes, and (2) used only by assisted living apartment residents and their non-paying guests; and • electricity provided for use in business related areas of the assisted living facility, if the assisted living facility's sole purpose is to provide independent residential living with only basic personal care support services and the electricity is centrally metered and billed as such. South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 17-4 (Aug. 28, 2017). The following sales of electricity to an assisted living facility are subject to sales tax:• electricity provided to residential assisted facility amenities which are available for a business purpose or available to non-residents of the assisted living facility complex for a fee; • electricity provided for use in business related areas of the assisted living facility, if the electricity for the entire assisted living facility is not centrally metered and billed as such; and • electricity provided to any area of the facility that provides healthcare or supervised care in a manner similar to a nursing home, rehabilitation center, psychiatric care facility, drug treatment facility, alcohol treatment facility, hospice care center, or any other similar facility. South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 17-4 (Aug. 28, 2017). BNA-SUTN SC 30.2.1.
