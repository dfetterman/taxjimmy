Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Sales Tax

Yes Sales tax applies to the retail sale, rental, lease, or license to use tangible personal property and certain services in Florida, unless the transaction is specifically exempt. Fla. Stat. §212.05. For the privilege of engaging in business in Florida, a dealer must add sales tax to the price of taxable goods or services sold and collect the tax from the purchaser of the goods or services. Fla. Stat. §212.07(1)(a); Fla. Stat. §212.07(2); Florida Tax Brochure GT-800013; Florida Tax Brochure GT-300015; see also Florida Tax Brochure GT-800029 (addressing the five most common taxes that Florida imposes on businesses). The Florida sales tax must be separately stated on any charge ticket, sales slip, invoice, or other tangible evidence of sale produced in connection with a sale. Fla. Stat. §212.07(2); see Florida Technical Assistance Advisement 15A-019 (Nov. 23, 2015) (taxpayer who both sells and installs doors and door frames must separately state sales tax due on contracts that are for materials only). The amount of the sales tax separately stated will constitute a debt, recoverable in the same manner as other debts, from the purchaser of the taxable goods or services to the dealer, until paid. Fla. Stat. §212.07(2). However, if the dealer fails to separately state the sales tax on the charge ticket, sales slip, invoice, or other tangible evidence of sale produced in connection with a sale, then no debt for payment of the sales tax is incurred by the purchaser, and the dealer may not recover the amount of the sales tax due on the sale from the purchaser in court. Fla. Stat. §212.07(2); Donoghue v. Wallach, 455 So. 2d 1085 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1984); see also Advanced Mobilehome Sys. of Tampa, Inc. v. Alumax Fabricated Prods., Inc., 666 So. 2d 166 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1995) (where front of invoice contained a box entitled “tax” in which the word “no” was printed, statement on back of invoice that buyer was responsible for all taxes on sale was insufficient to create a debt from buyer to dealer for sales tax due on sale under either Fla. Stat. §212.07(2) or state contract law). Even when the purchaser does incur a debt to the dealer for the tax due on a sale, the dealer is not relieved from liability for payment of the tax, but only acquires a cause of action against the purchaser for collection of the tax. Fla. Stat. §212.07(2); Florida Final Order DOR 1997-1-FOF (Jan. 7, 1997). When the dealer neglects, fails, or refuses to collect the tax from the purchaser, the dealer commits a misdemeanor and is liable for payment of the tax to the Department of Revenue. Fla. Stat. §212.07(2). On Nov. 6, 2018, Florida voters approved a ballot initiative amending the state constitution to require a two-thirds supermajority to create or increase any state sales or use tax. No state sales or use tax may be created and no rate may be raised unless approved by a two-thirds supermajority of each house of the legislature. Fla. Const. art. VII, §19, as added by 2018 Fla. H.J.R. 7001, effective Jan. 8, 2019 (as approved by voters on Nov. 6, 2018). A rate “raise” includes any decrease or elimination of a state sales or use tax exemption or credit. Fla. Const. art. VII, §19, as added by 2018 Fla. H.J.R. 7001, effective Jan. 8, 2019 (as approved by voters on Nov. 6, 2018). BNA-SUTN FL 1.1.1.

Yes A compensating use tax generally applies to every person who uses, consumes, distributes, and stores tangible personal property for use or consumption in Florida that would have been subject to Florida sales tax, but sales tax was not collected at the time of purchase. Fla. Stat. §212.05. However, use tax is not imposed if a similar tax equal to the use tax was paid in another state (e.g., sales tax was paid when an item was purchased in another state). If the amount of tax paid in another state on the purchase of tangible personal property is less than the amount due for Florida use tax, the taxpayer must pay the difference between the tax paid in the other state and the Florida use tax. Fla. Stat. §212.06(7); Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.091(3). BNA-SUTN FL 1.1.2.

Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Local Option Sales and Use Tax

Local Tax Authorized Most counties impose a discretionary sales surtax, sometimes referred to as a county tax, on transactions that are subject to sales and use tax. See, e.g., Fla. Stat. §212.054. The list of counties levying the surtax is subject to frequent revision. An up-to-date list of counties levying the surtax and their respective surtax rates can be found in Florida Tax Information Publication DR-15DSS. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-15.001(2); Fla. Stat. §212.055; see also Florida Tax Information Publication GT-300015; Florida v. Osceola County, 752 So. 2d 530 (Fla. 1999); Alachua County v. Adams, 702 So. 2d 1253 (Fla. 1997);Florida Dept. of Rev., Common Sales Tax Brackets. Discretionary sales surtax must be collected when the transaction occurs in, or delivery is made into, a county that imposes surtax, and the sale is subject to sales and use tax. Florida Tax Brochure GT-300015. Surtax Limitation The surtax does not apply to the sales amount above $5,000 on any item of tangible personal property. Fla. Stat. §212.054(2)(b)(1); Florida Tax Brochure GT-800019. However, the surtax does apply to the first $5,000 of the sales amount on the sale, use, lease, rental, or license to use any item of tangible personal property, including electric power or energy. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-15.004(2)(a). The $5,000 limit does not apply to sales of admissions; sales and uses of services; sales of service warranties; charges for prepaid calling arrangements; leases, rentals, and licenses to use real property or transient accommodations;leases or rentals of parking or storage space for motor vehicles in parking lots or garages, docking or storage space in boat docks and marinas, and tie-down or storage space for aircraft; and all other transactions subject to the discretionary sales surtax. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-15.004(2)(a); Florida Tax Brochure GT-800029. When multiple items of tangible personal property are sold by a dealer to the same purchaser at the same time, the $5,000 limitation applies when the sale or purchase is a single sale and is a sale of items normally sold in bulk or items that comprise a working unit, or a part of a working unit. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-15.004(3). Single Sale The sale or purchase of multiple items of tangible personal property must be a single sale in which the purchaser buys all items of tangible personal property from the dealer at the same time. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-15.004(3)(a). There must be an invoice, sales slip, charge ticket, written purchase order or agreement, or other tangible evidence of sale that establishes the items were sold in a single sale. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-15.004(3)(a)(1); Florida Technical Assistance Advisement 18A-018 (Nov. 27, 2018) (invoice established that multiple items sold in specific quantities and delivered at the same time was a single sale). A single sale of items of tangible personal property that is documented by a written purchase order or written agreement executed between a purchaser and the selling dealer should:• provide for a specific quantity of tangible personal property; Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-15.004(3)(a)(2)(a). and • if delivery of all items does not occur at the same time, provide for a specific time period within which delivery of the tangible personal property to the purchaser must be made. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-15.004(3)(a)(2)(b). Each delivery of items of tangible personal property will be treated as a single sale, when a written purchase order or written agreement does not specify the quantity and the time period during which delivery of the property will occur. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-15.004(3)(a)(3). Items Normally Sold in Bulk or Items That Comprise a Working Unit A single sale must be a sale of items of tangible personal property that meets at least one of the following conditions, the items are:• multiple quantities of a single item that the dealer normally sells in multiple quantities in the normal course of the dealer's business or that the purchaser normally buys in multiple quantities in the normal course of the purchaser's business; • normally sold as a set or a unit and the utility of each for its intended purposes is dependent on the set being complete; • normally sold in single sale by the seller to the purchaser for use in the normal business practice of the purchaser as an integrated unit; or • component parts that have no utility unless assembled with each other to form a working unit or part of a working unit. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-15.004(3)(b). Multiple Items of Tangible Personal Property in a Single Sale Multiple items of tangible personal property sold or purchased under a single sales transaction that are not normally sold in bulk or that, when assembled, will not comprise a working unit, part of a working unit, or comprise an integrated unit to be used in the purchaser's normal business practice, cannot be aggregated into a single sale for purposes of the surtax limitation.
