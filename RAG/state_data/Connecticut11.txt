Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Excise and Replacement Taxes

Yes Excise Taxes Connecticut imposes several excise taxes that function in a manner similar to the state's sales and use tax. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-433 through Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-454; Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-285 through Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-326h; Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-202; Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-210; Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-458d.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Historical Information

Est. 1947 Connecticut first imposed a sales and use tax in 1947 at the rate of 3 percent. Other states had already begun imposing these taxes earlier in response to property tax revenues falling significantly during the Great Depression.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Pending and Trending Developments

Economic Nexus/Clothing Exemption Effective Dec. 1, 2018, Connecticut requires online retailers that lack a physical presence to collect and remit sales and use tax if they have at least$250,000 in annual in-state sales and 200 separate transactions. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(12)(G), as amended by 2018 Conn. S.B. 417, effective Dec. 1, 2018; Connecticut Special Notice SN 2018(5) (June 26, 2018). Effective July 1, 2019, the economic nexus threshold for requiring remote sellers to collect and remit sales tax is reduced to $100,000 of sales and 200 or more transactions. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(12)(G), as amended by 2018 Conn. S.B. 417, effective Dec. 1, 2018, and by 2019 Conn. H.B. 7424, §327, effective July 1, 2019; Connecticut Special Notice SN 2018(5) (June 26, 2018). Previously, on April 26, 2017, the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services released a statement indicating that it will pursue out-of-state sellers that have a substantial economic presence in the state. Connecticut Dept. of Rev. Svcs., Connecticut Pursues Sales Taxes Not Paid by On-Line Retailers (April 26, 2017). Specifically, on April 26, 2017, the department stated that the “current state law requires out-of-state sellers of goods that have a substantial economic presence in the state to collect and remit sales tax.” Connecticut Dept. of Rev. Svcs., Connecticut Pursues Sales Taxes Not Paid by On-Line Retailers (April 26, 2017). See Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(15)(A)(v). Additionally, following the Connecticut Department of Revenue's issuance of notification letters to taxpayers that they owe use tax for purchases made through online retailers, several non-collecting online retailers have provided the department with sales records covering several years and those customers have been notified that they owe use tax, as of March 12, 2018. Connecticut Dept. of Rev. Svcs., Notification Letters Sent to Online Purchasers Who Owe CT Use Tax. For more information about economic nexus, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Connecticut 3.1.2.4. Repealed Clothing Exemption Connecticut has changed the taxability of clothing several times. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-412(47). Prior to July 1, 2011, a single article of clothing or footwear with a cost of less than$50 per article was exempt from Connecticut's sales tax. However, on July 1, 2011, that exemption was repealed and such items became taxable, except during the sales tax holiday. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-412(47); Connecticut Special Notice SN 2015(5) (July 17, 2015); Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2015(22) (Aug. 6, 2015). See also 2011 Conn. Pub. Acts 11-6 §166, as enacted by 2011 Conn. S.B. 1239, effective July 1, 2011. Currently, Connecticut imposes sales tax on sales of clothing at the general rate of 6.35 percent; however, articles of clothing with a cost of more than $1,000 are taxed at the rate of 7.75 percent. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-408(1)(A); Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-408(1)(H)(iii). In 2014, legislation was enacted which would have reinstated the $50 exemption from sales tax for any single article of clothing or footwear. 2014 Conn. Pub. Acts 14-47 §§47-49; 2014 Conn. Pub. Acts 130, §15; 2014 Conn. Pub. Acts 155, §14; 2014 Conn. Pub. Acts 217, §§196, 223, 225. However, the reinstatement, which was to be effective on July 1, 2015, was repealed. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-412(119), as repealed by 2015 Conn. Pub. Acts 244, §222. Although clothing and footwear remain taxable, such items are exempt from Connecticut sales tax during the annual sales tax holiday. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407e(a)(2), as amended by 2015 Conn. H.B. 7061, §71, effective July 1, 2015. Annual Summary of Legislative Changes Connecticut's Department of Revenue Services publishes an annual summary of each year's legislative tax changes. For example, in 2015, car wash services, a water company's purchases, and motor vehicle parking in seasonal lots having 30 or more spaces are all taxable as of July 1, 2015. See, e.g., Connecticut Dept. of Rev. Svcs., Summary of 2015 Tax Legislation (summarizing the 2015 legislation that affected all tax types). The Connecticut Department of Revenue's published summary of 2016 legislative changes included a new sales tax exemption to be effective July 1, 2018, for feminine hygiene products and disposable or reusable diapers; a provision effective January 1, 2017, preventing the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services from issuing or renewing a seller's permit, if the taxpayer has any outstanding unfiled sales or use tax returns; and an exclusion from sales tax, effective May 17, 2016, of charges for any motor vehicle parking service provided by the federal government, state of Connecticut or its political subdivisions and charges for the provision of space in municipally owned parking lots.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Sale' and 'Retail Sale'

Defined “Retail sale” and “sale at retail” are defined as a sale of tangible personal property for any purpose, other than resale in the regular course of business, or a transfer for consideration of the occupancy of any room in a hotel or lodging house for a period of 30 consecutive calendar days or less, or the rendering of any taxable service. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(3)(A). “Sale” and “selling”are defined as and include:• a transfer of title, exchange, or barter of tangible personal property for a consideration; • withdrawal of tangible personal property from the place where it is located for delivery to a point in Connecticut for the purpose of the transfer of title, exchange, or barter of the property for a consideration; • the producing, fabricating, processing, printing, or imprinting of tangible personal property, for consideration, for consumers who furnish the materials used in the producing, fabricating, processing, printing, or imprinting, including, but not limited to, sign construction, photofinishing, duplicating, and photocopying; • the furnishing and distributing of tangible personal property for a consideration by social clubs and fraternal organizations to their members or others; • the furnishing, preparing, or serving, for consideration, of food, meals, or drinks; • a transaction whereby the possession of property is transferred but the seller retains the title as security for the payment of the price; and • a transfer for consideration of the title of tangible personal property that has been produced, fabricated, or printed to the special order of the customer, or of any publication, including, but not limited to, sign construction, photofinishing, duplicating, and photocopying. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(2)(A) through Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(2)(G). “Sale” and “selling”are also defined as and include:• a transfer for consideration of the occupancy of any room in a hotel or lodging house for a period of 30 consecutive calendar days or less; • the rendering of certain services, telecommunications service, community antenna television service, or competitive video service (defined in §§12-407(a)(37); (26); (27); and (39), respectively)for consideration, exclusive of any such service rendered by an employee for the employer of such employee; • the leasing or rental of tangible personal property of any kind, except the lease or rental of a motion picture film to the owner or operator of a motion picture theater for display at the theater; • the transfer for consideration of space or the right to use any space for the purpose of storage or mooring of any noncommercial vessel, exclusive of dry or wet storage or mooring of the vessel during the period beginning on the first day of November in any year to, and including, the 30th day of April of the next year; • the sale of naming rights to any place of amusement, entertainment, or recreation within the meaning of Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-540(3); • the transfer for consideration of a prepaid telephone calling service and the recharge of a prepaid telephone calling service; Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(2)(H) through Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(2)(O). See also Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(34) (defining the term “prepaid telephone calling service”). and • the furnishing by any person, for consideration, of space for storage of tangible personal property when the person is engaged in the business of furnishing such space. However, “sale” and “selling”do not mean or include the furnishing of space that is used by a person for residential purposes. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(2)(P). Under the Connecticut drop-shipment rule, a “retail sale” also includes the delivery in Connecticut of tangible personal property by an owner or former owner thereof or by a factor, if the delivery is to a consumer pursuant to a retail sale made by a retailer not engaged in business in Connecticut, and is treated as a retail sale in Connecticut by the person making the delivery Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(3)(A); see also the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Connecticut 7.6. BNA-SUTN CT 1.4.1.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Lease'

Not Defined Connecticut does not define “lease.” See Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(2)(J); Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-426-25. However, Connecticut's definition of the terms “sale” and “selling”include leases and rentals of tangible personal property “of any kind whatsoever.” Thus, in Connecticut a lease of tangible personal property for consideration is a taxable sale. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(2)(J); Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-426-25. Certain types of leases are excluded from the definition of “retail sale” and “sale at retail.” For example, sales and use taxes do not apply to a sale and leaseback arrangement, if within 120 days from the original sale the original purchaser sells or contracts to sell the property to a retailer that will lease it back to the original purchaser in a taxable lease. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(9); Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2015(12) (Jan. 2015) (replacing Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2006(11) (April 2007)). BNA-SUTN CT 1.4.2.

==================================================

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Use' or 'Storage, Use, or Consumption'

Defined “Use”includes the exercise of any right or power over tangible personal property incident to the ownership of that property, except for sales conducted in the regular course of business. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(5). “Storage” is considered a form of use, and includes any keeping or retention in Connecticut for any purpose, except sale in the regular course of business or later use outside Connecticut of tangible personal property purchased from a retailer. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(4). The terms “storage”and “use” do not include keeping, retaining, or exercising any right or power over tangible personal property shipped or brought into Connecticut for the purpose of subsequently transporting it outside the state for use outside the state, or for the purpose of being processed, fabricated, or manufactured into, attached to or incorporated into, other tangible personal property to be transported outside the state for use outside the state. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(6)(A). “Storage” and “use”also do not include keeping, retaining, or exercising any right or power over tangible personal property acquired by the customer of a commercial printer while the property is located at the premises of the commercial printer in Connecticut under a contract with the printer for printing and distribution of printed material if the commercial printer could have acquired the property free of sales or use tax. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(6)(B). Morton Buildings v. Bannon The Connecticut Supreme Court has held that use tax does not apply to materials purchased and processed into building components outside the state and used to construct buildings within Connecticut. In Morton Buildings, Inc. v. Bannon, the taxpayer, an Illinois company, sold and erected pre-fabricated buildings for use in Connecticut and in other states. The taxpayer purchased raw materials outside of the state and made them into building components at factories located outside the state. When a customer ordered a building, the taxpayer withdrew the necessary raw materials from storage and made them into building components. These materials included lumber, nails, cement, staples, insulation, and plastic sheeting. The taxpayer sought a refund on all of the use taxes it paid to Connecticut for the cost of the raw materials it used at its factories outside the state to make building components used in Connecticut. The taxpayer argued that the raw materials in issue were not “purchased from a retailer” because the building components made out of the raw materials were new and different items of tangible personal property. Morton Bldgs., Inc. v. Bannon, 607 A.2d 424, 222 Conn. 49 (Conn. 1992). In its analysis, the Supreme Court of Connecticut applied the following test to determine if the imposition of use tax on the raw materials in issue was proper:• whether the item of tangible personal property is used, stored or consumed in Connecticut; • whether the item of personal property is purchased (not manufactured by the user);and • whether the purchase of the item of personal property is for use, storage, or consumption in Connecticut. The Supreme Court held that the manufacturing process that was performed upon the raw materials did transform the raw materials into something that was not purchased from a retailer. As a result, the conversion of raw materials into identifiably distinguishable personal property excludes the raw materials from continued taxability under the use tax. Morton Bldgs., Inc. v. Bannon, 607 A.2d 424, 222 Conn. 49 (Conn. 1992). BNA-SUTN CT 1.4.3.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Tangible Personal Property'

Defined In Connecticut, “tangible personal property” means personal property which may be seen, weighed, measured, felt, touched, or which is in any other manner perceptible to the senses, including canned or prewritten computer software. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(13). “Tangible personal property” also includes the distribution, generation, and transmission of electricity. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(13). BNA-SUTN CT 1.4.4.

==================================================

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Intangible Property'

Not Defined Connecticut does not define the term “intangible property.” See Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407. However, Connecticut's case history and rulings indicate that utilizing the “true object test” helps to determine which items may qualify as nontaxable, intangible property or intangible rights. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407. In the case of Dine Out Tonight Club v. Connecticut Department of Revenue Services, a dining membership club solicits members by offering certain perks if applicants pay the membership fee to join the club. Namely, in consideration of the payment of a membership fee, an applicant receives a membership card that entitles the person to one free meal with the purchase of a second meal of equal or greater value at restaurants that participate in the club's plan. The applicant also receives a directory of participating restaurants. Utilizing the “true object test,” the Connecticut Supreme Court found that the true object of the transaction between the club and its applicants/members is essentially the conveyance of an intangible right to free meals;thus, there was no transfer of tangible personal property for consideration, which would trigger the sales tax. The membership card and directory are merely indicia of that intangible right and incidental to its exercise. Dine Out Tonight Club v. Connecticut Dept. of Rev. Svcs., 556 A.2d 580, 210 Conn. 567 (Conn. 1989). See also Connecticut Ruling 1992-4 (Mar. 31, 1992) (similar conclusion reached by the Connecticut Department of Revenue involving a retail/wholesale membership company and the payment of membership fees for a membership badge, which provided its members with the intangible right to shop at the company's stores). In Connecticut Ruling 1992-13, a Connecticut town entered into a contract with a regional resources recovery authority for the disposal of solid waste at their facility. The town enacted a “pay-as-you-throw” ordinance under which the trash of its resident homeowners will only be collected if it is placed in a specially colored and marked disposal bag, which the town makes available. The fee charged for the specially colored and marked bags are substantially more expensive than plain trash bags. The use of the specially colored and marked disposal bags enables the recovery authority to determine how much of the solid waste being disposed of at the facility is generated by the town's residents. The recovery authority then charges the town on a pro-rata basis for their share of the costs of operating the facility. The question at issue in the case is whether the distribution of the specially colored and marked trash bags for a fee to town residents was a sale of tangible personal property or an incidental indication of an intangible right. Utilizing the “true object test,” the Connecticut Department of Revenue found that the true object of the transaction between the town and the recovery authority is essentially the conveyance of an intangible right to dispose of their trash at the recovery authority's facility; thus, there was no transfer of tangible personal property for consideration, which would trigger the sales tax. If the town residents were merely concerned with purchasing trash bags to hold their garbage, they could purchase plain bags at a lower price. Instead, the specially colored and marked disposal bags are intended to indicate to the trash collectors that the homeowner has purchased the right of access to the recovery authority's facility in advance. Connecticut Ruling 1992-13 (July 21, 1992). In Connecticut Ruling 1990-48, the question at issue was whether the sales of tour packages, which included tickets to an event and transportation, were subject to sales and use tax. The transaction involved a corporation that sold tour packages consisting of tickets and passenger services, such as transportation to and attendance at events such as rock concerts. Transportation usually included bus transportation and, on occasion, chartered flights. However, the corporation neither acted as a promoter or primary ticket agent of a concert facility, nor did the corporation provide lodging, meals, or memorabilia. Looking to Dine Out Tonight Club v. Connecticut Department of Revenue Services, which utilized the “true object test,”the Connecticut Department of Revenue found that the sale of a concert ticket constitutes the sale of an intangible right, which is not subject to Connecticut's sales tax. The Department of Revenue also noted that the corporation had already paid all corresponding sales taxes and admissions tax when it purchased all the components of its packages. Connecticut Ruling 1990-48 (May 14, 1990). For more information about the true object test, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Connecticut 9.3.1. BNA-SUTN CT 1.4.5.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Retailer' or 'Vendor'

Defined Connecticut has an expansive definition of “retailer.” Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(12). Connecticut defines a “retailer”as:• every person engaged in the business of making sales at retail or in the business of making retail sales at auction of tangible personal property owned by the person or others; Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(12)(A). • every person engaged in the business of making sales for storage, use or other consumption or in the business of making sales at auction of tangible personal property owned by the person or others for storage, use or other consumption; Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(12)(B). • every operator, which means any person operating a hotel or lodging house in the state, including, but not limited to, the owner or proprietor of such premises, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any other person otherwise operating such hotel or lodging house; Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(12)(C); Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(18). and • every seller rendering any taxable service. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(12)(D); Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(2). Connecticut also considers the following to be a “retailer” for sales and use tax purposes:• every person under whom any salesman, representative, peddler, or canvasser operates in Connecticut, or from whom such salesman, representative, peddler, or canvasser obtains the tangible personal property that is sold; • every person with whose assistance any seller is enabled to solicit orders within Connecticut; • any person owned or controlled, either directly or indirectly, by a retailer engaged in business in Connecticut which is the same as or similar to the line of business in which such person is engaged; • any person owned or controlled, either directly or indirectly, by the same interests that own or control, either directly or indirectly, a retailer engaged in business in Connecticut which is the same as or similar to the line of business in which the person is engaged; • any assignee of a person engaged in the business of leasing tangible personal property to others, where the person's taxable leased property is situated within Connecticut and the assignee has a security interest in the property; • every person making retail sales of tangible personal property from outside Connecticut to a destination within Connecticut and not maintaining a place of business in Connecticut who directly or indirectly repairs or services such items, under a warranty, in Connecticut; and • every person making sales of tangible personal property or services through an agreement with another person located in Connecticut, under which such person, for a commission or other consideration that is based upon the retailer's sale of tangible personal property or services, directly or indirectly refers potential customers. This includes referrals by a link on an internet web site or otherwise, to the retailer, provided the cumulative gross receipts from sales by the retailer to customers in the state who are referred to the retailer by all such persons with this type of an agreement with the retailer, is in excess of$2,000 during the preceding four quarterly periods ending on the last day of March, June, September, and December. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(12)(E) through Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(12)(L). Effective July 1, 2019, Connecticut does not require a business to engage in regular or systematic solicitation of sales to be considered a retailer that is required to collect and remit sales taxes. Prior to July 1, 2019, Connecticut also included in its definition of retailer every person making retail sales from outside Connecticut to a destination within the state and not maintaining a place of business in the state who engages in regular or systematic solicitation of sales of tangible personal property in Connecticut:(i) by the display of advertisements on billboards or other outdoor advertising in Connecticut; (ii) by the distribution of catalogs, periodicals, advertising flyers or other advertising by means of print, radio, or television media; or (iii) by mail, telegraphy, telephone, computer database, cable, optic, microwave or other communication system, for the purpose of effecting retail sales of tangible personal property provided such person has gross receipts of $100,000 and made 200 or more retail sales into Connecticut. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(12)(G), as amended by 2019 Conn. H.B. 7424, §327, effective July 1, 2019. Connecticut was one of the first states to enact legislation which expanded the definition of a retailer engaged in business in Connecticut, to include out-of-state retailers who contract with in-state marketing affiliates that refer customers to the out-of-state(also referred to as “remote”) retailer's online store. This provision is often referred to as a “click-through”or “web-linking” nexus provision. See generally Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(12).
