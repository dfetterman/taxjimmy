Topic: Utilities, Fuel, Mining and Natural Resource Extraction, Production, Sale Mining, Timber, Natural Resource Extraction Timber

Depends Purchases of depreciable machinery and equipment used for commercial wood harvesting purposes are exempt from sales and use tax. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §2013(1)(A); Code Me. R. §18-125-323.05; Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 59 (Jan. 1, 2017). To qualify for the exemption, the machinery and equipment must meet three tests. It must be:• used directly in a qualified activity; Code Me. R. §18-125-323.01(2); Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 59 (Jan. 1, 2017). • used primarily (50% or more) in a qualified activity; Code Me. R. §18-125-323.01(5); Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 59 (Jan. 1, 2017). and • depreciable for federal income tax purposes. Code Me. R. §18-125-323.01(1); Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 59 (Jan. 1, 2017); see also Great N. Nekoosa Corp. v. Maine State Tax Assessor, 540 A.2d 770 (Me. 1988) (holding in 1988 that delimber-bunchers, machinery used for delimbing trees, purchased and used by a pulp and paper manufacturer did not qualify for the manufacturing exemption because the equipment was used in wood harvesting operations, which is excluded from the definition of production). Examples of machinery and equipment typically used for commercial wood harvesting purposes includes:• chainsaws; • chippers; • delimbers; • feller bunchers; • felling heads; • forwarders; • harvesters; But see Maine Administrative Decision BTA-2015-17 (June 20, 2016) (Maine Board of Tax Appeals held that tree harvesting machines taxpayer purchased prior to this exemption becoming effective were subject to sales and use tax). • mulchers; • skidders;and • slashers. Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 59 (Jan. 1, 2017). “Commercial Wood Harvesting”Defined Commercial wood harvesting is the commercial severance and yarding of trees for sale or further processing that will result in sales of forest products. Commercial wood harvesting begins with the severance of trees and includes all activities thereafter that are an integral and essential part of commercial wood harvesting up to, but not including, the loading of forest products for transport to market. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §2013(B-1); Code Me. R. §18-125-323.05; Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 59 (Jan. 1, 2017). Commercial wood harvesting includes the construction and maintenance of skid roads, skid trails, and winter haul roads. A “skid road” or “skid trail” is a route that is primarily used for hauling or dragging forest products from the stump to the yard or landing and requires minimal excavation for construction. A “winter haul road” is a route or track across frozen ground or compacted snow and ice that is used primarily for access to a yard or landing, but does not include a road with a gravel surface. Code Me. R. §18-125-323.05; Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 59 (Jan. 1, 2017). The construction and maintenance of land management and travel roads is not commercial wood harvesting. “Land management and travel roads” consist of a bed of exposed soil or gravel with other improvements which may include ditching, culverts, or bridges. These roads are at least semi-permanent and maintained to provide various uses including transport of forest products, forest management, agricultural, recreational, and other transport activities. Construction equipment purchased for constructing and maintaining land management and travel roads is not equipment traditionally used in wood harvesting. Code Me. R. §18-125-323.05; Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 59 (Jan. 1, 2017). Previously, two activities specifically excluded from the meaning of commercial agricultural production were: engaging in forestry and lumber operations of any sort; and tree farming (other than farming of fruit-bearing trees). Purchases by a person engaging in commercial timber activities were not eligible for the exemption from the sales and use tax for machinery and equipment, electricity, and products used in agricultural activities. Code Me. R. §18-125-323. Electricity Used in a Qualifying Commercial Wood Harvesting Activity or Support Operation Maine exempts electricity used in qualifying commercial wood harvesting activities or support operations. The exemption is applied on a meter-by-meter basis. If a single meter supplies electricity to be used in both qualifying and non-qualifying activities, then tax must be paid to the utility provider, and the purchaser must apply directly for a refund based on a prorated portion of the electricity used in qualified activities. Code Me. R. §18-125-323.06; Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 59 (Jan. 1, 2017). Support activities include storage operations, maintenance operations, and related administrative activities. Support activities do not include activities conducted by a separate business, reselling products procured or produced by someone else, retail store operations, or unrelated administrative activities. Code Me. R. §18-125-323.06; Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 59 (Jan. 1, 2017). Other Commercial Wood Harvesting Exemptions For sales on or after Jan. 1, 2017, fuel used by commercial wood harvesters in their commercial activities or support operations may be purchased exempt from sales tax. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §2013, as amended by 2016 Me. S.P. 647, effective April 16, 2016. Maine also exempts sales of tree seedlings for use in commercial forestry activities. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1760(73). Additionally, a trade-in credit is allowed for lumber harvesting equipment that qualifies as “special mobile equipment.” The credit reduces the value of the sale price for purposes of determining sales tax. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1765(7); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1752(14-B). BNA-SUTN ME 30.3.3.
