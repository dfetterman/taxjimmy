Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Real Property

Nontaxable West Virginia does not impose sales tax on the sale of real property. W. Va. Code §11-15-3. Installation of Tangible Personal Property onto Real Property Charges for installing tangible personal property onto real property can either be taxable or nontaxable. Charges for installing tangible personal property are taxable, unless the installation results in a capital improvement to the real property or is new construction. An installation of tangible personal property is not a capital improvement when the tangible personal property can be removed without causing damage to itself or the structure from which it is being removed, when it does not bear any weight of the structure, and is not an integral part of the structure. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-111. Charges for a capital improvement to real property are nontaxable because they are for a contracting service. Alternatively, charges for a non-capital improvement are taxable, but purchases of the materials used may be eligible for a resale exemption. West Virginia Publication TSD-310 (providing further guidance and a thorough list of examples of capital improvements). BNA-SUTN WV 28.1.

Depends The sale and incidental installation of tangible personal property is taxable to the consumer. The retail dealer who sells such property with incidental connection may purchase the property exempt from tax as a purchase for resale. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-114; West Virginia Publication TSD-325. The sale and installation of window air conditioning units, dishwashers, clothing washing machines or dryers, or other household appliances is considered a retail sale. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-114. The incidental installation rule applies where the product is sold by a retail dealer who maintains an inventory of the product or similar products, the product is installed by the retailer or their agent, and the installation is incidental to the sale of the product. In such a situation, the retailer must collect and remit sales tax on the sale of the product and any labor and materials charge. West Virginia Publication TSD-325.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal Sale and Installation of Plumbing Fixtures

Depends Whether the sale and installation of plumbing fixtures is taxable depends on whether the service being provided is a repair, maintenance, or installation of real property or a capital improvement. West Virginia Publication TSD-310. Persons in the construction trades making capital improvements for their customers are not required to collect sales tax from those customers. However, contractors making capital improvements must generally pay sales or use tax on all machinery, equipment, tools, and materials they purchase for use in their business and for use or consumption in making the capital improvements. West Virginia Publication TSD-310 (providing further guidance and a thorough list of examples of capital improvements). Persons who make alterations, repairs, improvements or decorations to buildings, structures or real property that are not capital improvements are providing “taxable services” and must collect the sales tax from their customers on both the labor and materials used in providing the taxable services. West Virginia Publication TSD-310 (providing further guidance and a thorough list of examples of capital improvements). With respect to plumbing, the installation or replacement of sprinkler systems, water pumps, water softeners, sinks, shower stalls, sinks, toilets, tub enclosures, and tubs are tax exempt capital improvements. The replacement of faucets or shower heads is a taxable installation of tangible personal property. West Virginia Publication TSD-310 (providing further guidance and a thorough list of examples of capital improvements).

West Virginia Publication TSD-325; West Virginia Publication TSD-310. The sale and installation of wall-to-wall carpeting, floor tiles, hardwood floors, linoleum, drapery rods, venetian blinds, window shades, and canvas awnings are taxable when sold and installed by a retailer. West Virginia Publication TSD-325. The incidental installation rule applies where the product is sold by a retail dealer who maintains an inventory of the product or similar products, the product is installed by the retailer or their agent, and the installation is incidental to the sale of the product. In such a situation, the retailer must collect and remit sales tax on the sale of the product and any labor and materials charge. West Virginia Publication TSD-325. If the product is not sold by a retailer, the complete installation of a tile floor, hardwood floor, linoleum, or wall-to-wall carpet is a tax exempt capital improvement. West Virginia Publication TSD-310 (providing further guidance and a thorough list of examples of capital improvements).

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal Sale and Installation of Signage

Depends Whether the sale and installation of signage is taxable depends on whether the signs require foundations or other means of permanent attachment. See, e.g., West Virginia Office of Tax Appeals Decision Docket No. 02-534 U (March 27, 2003). Signage that requires foundations or other means of permanent attachment is a tax exempt capital improvement.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Construction Materials and Contracts Construction Materials and Contracts, Generally

Taxable Generally, West Virginia imposes sales and use taxes on purchases by a contractor or subcontractor of tangible personal property or services used or consumed while providing a contracting service. W. Va. Code §11-15-8a(a); W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-107.2.10.1. Purchases by Contractors and Subcontractors For purposes of the sales and use taxes, leases of equipment, tools, or machinery used in completing contracting services are considered sales, and thus, are taxable. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-107.2.6. Contractors may not pass the taxes through to customers, but are entitled by law to consider sales and use taxes when bidding on construction work. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-107.4.1. Charges for contracting activities are not taxable to the consumer. The contractor is required to pay tax on purchases of materials used in performing such services. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, § 110-15-115.5. In contrast, when the service is deemed a general repair, contractors are required to collect tax on charges for the service. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, § 110-15-115.4. Further, the consumer of the service may be liable for use tax on the charge. See, e.g., West Virginia Office of Tax Appeals Decision Docket No. 49-268 U (July 29, 1998)(purchaser of contract maintenance services must pay use tax on taxable repair and maintenance services such as sign painting and gardening work). When contracting services do not result in a capital improvement, purchase of certain construction materials may be eligible for a resale exemption. If the services involve strictly repairs or improvements to machinery or equipment, the analysis will turn on whether the items became affixed to real property to the extent that removal would cause material damage to the item being removed or to the original building/structure. Such affixation results in capital improvement, and purchases of the materials used are subject to tax. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-107.3.3; West Virginia Office of Tax Appeals Decision Docket No. 09-276 U (Nov. 2, 2012). In West Virginia Office of Tax Appeals Decision Docket No. 09-276 U, a series of electrical installations was deemed sufficiently temporary/impermanent that they were not capital improvements. Instead, the ruling concluded that the electrical work constituted “repairs or improvements to machinery or equipment in an industrial setting,” and therefore purchases of the materials used were not subject to tax because they were purchases for resale. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-107.3.3; West Virginia Office of Tax Appeals Decision Docket No. 09-276 U (Nov. 2, 2012). Sales of Construction and Maintenance Materials Used in Construction or Maintenance of a Highway Project West Virginia exempts from tax the sale of construction and maintenance materials acquired by a second party for use in constructing or maintaining a highway project. W. Va. Code §11-15-9(b)(6). Construction or Expansion of a Warehouse or Distribution Facility West Virginia also exempts purchases of computers, software, primary material handling equipment, racking and racking systems, building materials, and tangible personal property used in constructing or expanding a warehouse or distribution facility. The exemption is available during the facility's expansion period, which begins one year prior to the start of construction and ends one year after construction of the facility has been substantially completed. The exemption applies to purchases by either the owner, lessor, or lessee of the warehouse facility. To qualify for the exemption, the warehouse facility must employ, when the expansion period is completed, at least 300 full-time, West Virginia residents domiciled in the state, and at least $50 million in real and personal property must be invested in the facility during the expansion period. W. Va. Code § 11-15-9n, as added by 2011 W. Va. S.B. 247, effective March 12, 2011. Regarding the warehouse facility exemption, contractors may assert the exemption if the purchaser of contracting services is entitled to claim the exemption. However, the liability for any assessed taxes is on the purchaser of the contracting services, not the contractor. W. Va. Code § 11-15-8d(b), as amended by 2011 W. Va. S.B. 247, effective March 12, 2011. The Integrated Manufacturer/Contractor Rule Producers or manufacturers of goods that are later used by the producer or manufacturers in contracting activities must pay the use tax on the “gross value” of such goods. West Virginia Publication TSD-355. “Gross value” means the gross proceeds that the producer or manufacturer would receive for selling a similar item in an arms-length transaction. Gross value is determined by applying the following rules in the order stated:• the gross value of the natural resource or manufactured product consumed or used in contracting shall be equal to the selling price, at the place of consumption or use, of similar products of like quality and character offered for sale in similar quantities by persons unrelated to the taxpayer; • in the absence of sales of similar products by other persons, gross value shall be equal to the average price at which sales of the same of similar products are made during the taxable year to customers of the producer or manufacturer;or • in the absence of sales to customers of the producer or manufacturer as a guide to value, gross value shall be determined by first deterring the cost of the product and then adding the average markup realized by the producer or manufacturer of the product being produced. The cost of the product shall include every item of cost attributable to that particular product including all direct and indirect overhead costs. West Virginia Publication TSD-355. However, if the production or manufacturing takes place at the job site, the producer or manufacturer is treated solely as a contractor, and use tax is calculated on the materials and equipment consumed or used in the manufacturing process. West Virginia Publication TSD-355. More information on the taxation of construction contractors is available at 1840 T.M., State Taxation of Construction Contractors. BNA-SUTN WV 28.3.1.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Services to Real Property Real Property Repair, Service

Depends Gross proceeds from maintaining, servicing, repairing, altering, improving, or decorating buildings, structures, or real property are taxable unless the service involves contracting, i.e., either an activity that results in a capital improvement or that is performed on or connected with new construction, reconstruction, expansion, or remodeling that results in a capital improvement. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, § 110-15-116.1. Determining whether consumers sales and service tax is due depends on the type of activity. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, § 110-15-116. Sales of Service: A person who provides a service that is not contracting must collect and remit consumers sales and service tax from the customer or obtain an exemption certificate or direct pay permit. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, § 110-15-116. Sales of Contracting: A person who engages in contracting does not charge consumers sales and service tax to the customer. The sale of contracting is not taxable. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, § 110-15-116.

Depends Whether or not the billing separately states parts and materials charges, a person providing contracting services, including real property repair services that qualify as contracting, does not collect sales and use taxes from the customer on the gross proceeds from providing such service. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, § 110-15-107.1.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Services to Real Property Real Property Installation

Depends Installation of tangible personal property that results in a capital improvement to a building or other structure or to real property is considered contracting and such charges are not taxable. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-111.1. Charges for installation that does not constitute a capital improvement are taxable. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-111.4. A capital improvement occurs when either the service performed substantially increases the capital value of the structure or results in an appreciable increase in the original useful life of the structure. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-111.2; West Virginia Office of Tax Appeals Decision Docket No. 09-276 U (Nov. 2, 2012). Factors For Determination of Capital Improvement If either of the following criteria is met, the installation will be considered a capital improvement to a building, structure, or real property, and will be considered contracting.(1) If the installation results in a significant increase in the capital value of the building or structure and the tangible personal property is permanently affixed to the real property. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-111.2.1. (2) If the installation results in an appreciable increase in the original useful life of the building/structure/real property and the tangible personal property is permanently affixed to the real property. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-111.2.2. New Construction, Reconstruction, Alteration, Expansion or Remodeling The installation of tangible personal property is contracting when it is “on or connected with“ new construction, reconstruction, alteration, expansion or remodeling of real property or structures that itself results in a capital improvement to a building, structure, or real property. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-111.3. “On or connected with” is broad and conveys its generally accepted meaning. However, “on or connected with” does not connote that things connected have to be primary or subsidiary to the construction, reconstruction, alteration, expansion, or remodeling of the building or other structure or real property. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-111.3.1 The following is a non-exclusive list of examples of property that becomes a part of realty, and thus, is a capital improvement, and the installation of which is contracting:• boilers and furnaces for space heating; • built-in household items such as kitchen cabinets, dishwashers, sinks (including faucets), fans, garbage disposals, and incinerators; • buildings and structural and other improvements to buildings, including awnings, canopies, foundations, for machinery, floors (including computer room floors), walls, general wiring and lighting facilities, roofs, stairways, stairlifts, sprinkler systems, storm doors and windows, door controls, air curtains, loading platforms, central air conditioning units, building elevators, sanitation and plumbing systems, and heating, cooling and ventilation systems; • fixed year-round wharfs and docks; • improvements to land including retaining walls, roads, walks, bridges, fencing, railway switch tracks, ponds, dams, ditches, wells, underground irrigation systems, drainage, storm and sanitary sewers, and water supply lines for drinking water, sanitary purposes and fire protections; • telephone switching equipment and wiring; • residential water heaters, water softeners, intercoms, garage door opening equipment when it satisfies the requirements of Section 117.8 of these regulations, pneumatic tub systems and music and sound equipment (except portable equipment); • drive-up and walk-up windows, night depository equipment, remote TVs, autoteller systems, vault and vault doors, and camera security equipment (except portable equipment); • seating in auditoriums and theatres and theatre stage lights (except portable seating and lighting); • silos and grain storage bins; • storage tanks constructed on site; • swimming pools; • truck platform scale foundations; and • walk-in cold storage units becoming a component part of a building. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-111.6. Additionally, contracting includes the installation of tangible personal property that by its very nature becomes a structure that is considered to constitute a capital improvement. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-111.7. Conversely, a capital improvement does not include a contract providing only for the sale and installation of tangible personal property that remains tangible personal property after its installation. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-111.4. The following is a non-exclusive list of property that normally remains tangible personal property after installation and does not constitute a capital improvement:• furnishings, radio and television sets and antennas, washers and dryers, portable lamps, home freezers, portable appliances, and window air conditioning units; • portable items such as tables, counters, cabinets, lockers, athletic and gymnasium equipment and other similar items; • freestanding machinery and equipment, tools, appliances, and materials used exclusively as such by manufacturers, industrial processors, and other persons performing a processing function with the items; and • freestanding furniture and equipment, including freestanding office machines, used in offices and banks.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Services to Real Property Plumbing

Depends Whether plumbing services are taxable depends on whether the service being provided is a repair, maintenance, or installation of real property or a capital improvement. West Virginia Publication TSD-310. Persons in the construction trades making capital improvements for their customers are not required to collect sales tax from those customers. However, contractors making capital improvements must generally pay sales or use tax on all machinery, equipment, tools, and materials they purchase for use in their business and for use or consumption in making the capital improvements. West Virginia Publication TSD-310 (providing further guidance and a thorough list of examples of capital improvements). Persons who make alterations, repairs, improvements or decorations to buildings, structures or real property that are not capital improvements are providing “taxable services” and must collect the sales tax from their customers on both the labor and materials used in providing the taxable services. West Virginia Publication TSD-310 (providing further guidance and a thorough list of examples of capital improvements). With respect to plumbing, the installation or replacement of sprinkler systems, water pumps, water softeners, sinks, shower stalls, sinks, toilets, tub enclosures, and tubs are tax exempt capital improvements. The replacement of faucets or shower heads is a taxable installation of tangible personal property. West Virginia Publication TSD-310 (providing further guidance and a thorough list of examples of capital improvements).
