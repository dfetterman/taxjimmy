Destination Hawaii employs destination-based sourcing for its general excise tax applicable to general retail sales. Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-13(2); Hawaii Tax Information Release No. 1995-5. Manufacturers and producers of tangible personal property are exempt from payment of general excise tax on gross income derived from the sale, manufacture, or production of goods delivered outside of the state. Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-29.5; Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-13(2)(C); Hawaii Tax Information Release No. 1998-5; Hawaii Tax Information Release No. 1995-5. Hawaii does not impose the general excise tax on sales of tangible personal property that originate outside of Hawaii, unless the tangible personal property's place of delivery is in Hawaii and the seller has nexus with the state. Delivery of tangible personal property to a freight consolidator, freight forwarder, or for-hire carrier for transporting the tangible personal property does not constitute acceptance of the property by the purchaser, unless the freight consolidator, freight forwarder, or for-hire carrier has written authority to accept the property for the purchaser. Hawaii Tax Information Release No. 1995-5. Gross income from the rental or lease of personal property is allocated to: (1) the tax district in which the rental or lease is made from a place of business of the taxpayer, or (2)the tax district in which the property is primarily used. In the alternative, the taxpayer may allocate the gross income by using any other method approved by the Director of Taxation. Haw. Regs. §18-237-34-05(a). Gross income from contracting or services performed by a taxpayer engaged in a service business is allocated to the district where the services are used or consumed. Haw. Regs. §18-237-8.6-03(a), as amended March 29, 2018. If services are used or consumed in more than one taxation district, gross income must be allocated using any reasonable method. The allocation method must be consistently used by the taxpayer and supported by verifiable data that reasonably quantifies the proportionate benefit received by each taxation district. Haw. Regs. §18-237-8.6-03(b), as added March 29, 2018. Effective March 29, 2018, gross income from a taxpayer's investment interest is allocated to the district where the investment is controlled. Alternatively, the taxpayer may allocate the gross income by any reasonable method, if consistently used consistently used by the taxpayer and supported by verifiable data that reasonably quantifies the proportionate benefit received by each taxation district. Prior to March 29, 2018, gross income from a taxpayer's investment interest is allocated to the district where the control of the investment is located, unless the taxpayer can show that a different location should control. Haw. Regs. §18-237-8.6-08(a), as amended March 29, 2018. However, persons engaged in business within and outside of Hawaii must generally apportion the applicable amount of gross income to their Hawaii business activities. Except for persons subject to Hawaii's general excise tax imposed upon manufacturers, Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-13(1). persons engaged in business within and outside of Hawaii or persons engaged in selling goods for delivery outside of Hawaii must apportion their gross income and applicable tax from their Hawaii business activities to the extent required by federal law or Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-29.5 (Exemption for sales of tangible personal property shipped out of the state). Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-21. In the event that the apportionment of gross income derived from business activities within Hawaii cannot be accurately determined, the proportion of gross income subject to Hawaii's general excise tax is made based on the cost of doing business in Hawaii compared to the total cost of doing business both within and outside of Hawaii. Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-21; see Hawaii Dir. of Taxn. v. Lynden Air Freight Inc., 89 Haw. 51, 968 P.2d 653 (Haw. 1998). Intangible Personal Property If intangible personal property is used both inside and outside the state, the total value will be subject to tax in proportion to the benefit received inside the state, using any reasonable method of apportionment. Where the property is used depends on who the customer is:• If the customer is a business and the property was acquired for use in the business, the property is used where the business activities occur. If not acquired for use in a business, the property is used to where the principle place of business is located. • If the customer is an individual, the property is used where the individual resides. • If the customer is in the military or federal, state, or local government, the property is used where the benefit of the property is received.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Services

Depends Gross receipts from services for determining the general excise tax are sourced to the place “in which the services are intended to be used or consumed.” Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-8.6; Hawaii Tax Information Release No. 2018-06 (June 25, 2018). The Department of Taxation has taken the position that the sourcing focus is no longer on the location where the taxpayer-service provider is physically located, but rather where the customer uses or receives a benefit from the services. Generally, whether the use tax must be paid on imported contracting or services is determined based on the location where the services are used or consumed. See Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-8.6; Haw. Regs. §18-237-8.6-03; Hawaii Tax Information Release No. 2018-06 (June 25, 2018); Hawaii Tax Information Release No. 2009-02; Hawaii Announcement No. 2009-34.

Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-29.53(a). Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-29.53 does not apply where all of the value or gross income is derived from cancellation fees, forfeited deposits, or other charges resulting from the cancellation or nonperformance of services.

Regs. §18-237-29.53-12; Hawaii Tax Information Release No. 2009-02 The seller or person rendering the contracting or services exported and resold, consumed, or used outside of Hawaii must take from the customer, a certificate or an equivalent, certifying that the contracting or service purchased is to be otherwise resold, consumed, or used outside the State. The certificate or equivalent must be in a form the department prescribes. Any customer who furnishes this certificate or an equivalent must pay the seller or person rendering the contracting or services, upon demand, if the contracting or service purchased is not resold or otherwise consumed or used outside of Hawaii, the amount of the additional tax which by reason thereof is imposed upon the seller or person rendering the contracting or service. Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-29.53(a). Further, Hawaii exempts all of the value or gross income derived from contracting or services performed by a person engaged in a service business or calling in Hawaii for a purchaser who resells all of the contracting or services for resale, consumption, or use outside of Hawaii, which meet the criteria above. The seller or person rendering the contracting or services for a purchaser who resells the contracting or services for resale, consumption, or use outside of Hawaii must take from the purchaser, a certificate or an equivalent, certifying that the contracting or services purchased is to be for resale, consumption, or use outside of Hawaii, which meet the criteria above. The certificate or equivalent must be in a form the department prescribes. Any purchaser who furnishes this certificate or an equivalent must pay the seller or person rendering the contracting or services, upon demand, if the contracting or services purchased is not resold in its entirety to a customer of the purchaser who has complied with subsection (a), the amount of the additional tax which by reason thereof is imposed upon the seller or the person rendering the contracting or service. Haw. Rev. Stat. §237-29.53(b). If contracting or services are used or consumed both in and outside of Hawaii, all of the value or gross income will be subject to general excise tax. However, such value may be apportioned to tax on the portion where the benefit was received in Hawaii. Any reasonable method of apportioning all of the value or gross income may be used. The method must be consistently used by the taxpayer and supported by verifiable data that reasonably quantifies the proportionate benefit received in Hawaii. Haw. Regs. §18-237-29.53-02(b).
