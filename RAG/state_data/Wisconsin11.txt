Local Tax Authorized The state of Wisconsin has authorized local county governments to enact a sales and use tax by ordinance, provided that such ordinance states the purpose for the tax. Wis. Stat. §77.71(1). Such a sales and use tax may be imposed only for the purpose of directly reducing the property tax levy, or to defray the cost of any item that can be funded by the property tax. Wis. Stat. §77.71(1); Wis. Stat. §77.70, as amended by 2017 Wis. A.B. 1, effective Sept. 20, 2017; Wisconsin Tax Bulletin 199 - October 2017. The sales and use tax that county governments are authorized to levy parallels and is in addition to the 5 percent state sales and use tax. Wis. Stat. §77.71(1). An item purchased in a county that has not adopted the county tax that subsequently is stored, used or consumed in a taxable county is not subject to the county use tax. Wisconsin Fact Sheet 2104. In Wisconsin counties that have adopted a county tax, the county tax is a 0.5 percent tax imposed on the sales price from retail sales, licenses, leases, or rentals of tangible personal property, certain coins and stamps, certain leased property affixed to realty, or certain digital goods, or the selling, licensing, performing, or furnishing of taxable services in a county with a county tax, with the following exception. Sales of motor vehicles, boats, recreational vehicles, and aircraft are subject to the county use tax (rather than county sales tax). Retailers who make sales subject to the 0.5 percent county tax must collect 5.5 percent sales tax on their retail sales:• 5 percent state sales tax, and • 0.5 percent county sales tax. As of May 1, 2019, there is no county sales and use tax in the following counties:• Manitowoc; • Menominee; • Outagamie; • Racine; • Waukesha;and • Winnebago. Wisconsin Publication 209.

Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Excise and Replacement Taxes

Yes Excise Taxes Wisconsin imposes several excise taxes that operate similarly to state sales tax. See Wis. Stat. §139.06(1); Wis. Stat. §78.55; Wis. Stat. §78.01. The state, for example, imposes excise taxes on sales of alcohol and tobacco products as well as sales motor fuel and aviation fuel. See Wis. Stat. §139.06(1); Wis. Stat. §78.55; Wis. Stat. §78.01.

Replacement Taxes The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement prohibits member states from imposing a “prohibited replacement tax” which is a tax outside of the sales and use tax that is imposed on products defined in the Agreement. Generally, the Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board will make a finding regarding whether or not a member state has imposed a replacement tax. Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, as amended through Dec. 14, 2018, Section 334; Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board Rules and Procedures, as amended through May 3, 2018. BNA-SUTN WI 1.1.4.

Stat. §77.51(14g)(g). or • the transfer of all or substantially all of the taxable property held or used by a person in the course of an activity requiring the holding of a seller's permit, if after the transfer the real or ultimate ownership of the property is substantially similar to that which existed before the transfer. For the purposes of this rule, stockholders, bondholders, partners, members or other persons holding an interest in a corporation or other entity are regarded as having the real or ultimate ownership of the property, items, or goods of the corporation or other entity. Wis. Stat. §77.51(14g)(h). BNA-SUTN WI 1.4.1.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Lease'

Defined “Lease or rental,” means any transfer of possession or control of tangible personal property or items, property, or goods under Wis. Stat. §§77.52(1)(a), (b), (c), or (d) for a fixed or indeterminate term and for consideration. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.29(1)(a) Leases include a transfer that includes future options to purchase or extend, agreements related to the transfer of possession or control of motor vehicles or trailers, if the amount of any consideration may be increased or decreased by reference to the amount realized on the sale or other disposition of such motor vehicles or trailers, consistent with I.R.C. § 7701(h)(1). Wis. Stat. §77.51(14a). BNA-SUTN WI 1.4.2.

==================================================

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Use' or 'Storage, Use, or Consumption'

Defined “Use”is the exercise of any right or power over taxable property or services incident to the ownership, possession, or enjoyment of the property or services, or the results produced by the services. Wis. Stat. §77.51(22). This also includes installation or affixation to real property and including the possession of or exercise of any right or power over taxable property by a lessee under a lease. Wis. Stat. §77.51(22)(a); Wis. Stat. §77.51(18). “Use” does not include storage, which is defined as the keeping or retention in Wisconsin of taxable property purchased from a retailer for any purpose except sale in the regular course of business. Wis. Stat. §77.51(22)(a); Wis. Stat. §77.51(18). Morton Buildings Inc. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Rev. A Wisconsin court has held that use tax does not apply to materials purchased and processed into building components outside the state and used to construct buildings within Wisconsin. In Morton Buildings Inc. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Rev., the taxpayer, an Illinois company, sold and erected pre-fabricated buildings for use in Wisconsin and in other states. The taxpayer purchased raw materials outside of the state and made them into building components at factories located outside the state. When a customer ordered a building, the taxpayer withdrew the necessary raw materials from storage and made them into building components. These materials included lumber, nails, cement, staples, insulation, and plastic sheeting. The taxpayer sought a refund on all of the use tax it paid to Wisconsin for the cost of the raw materials it used at its factories outside the state to make building components used in Wisconsin. The taxpayer argued that the raw materials at issue were not “purchased from a retailer"because the building components made out of the raw materials were new and different items of tangible personal property. Wisconsin Tax Bulletin No. 76 - Report on Litigation, Morton Buildings Inc. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Rev.. In its analysis, the court applied the following test to determine whether the imposition of use tax on the raw materials at issue was proper. First, the item of tangible personal property must be used, stored or consumed in Wisconsin. Second, it must also be purchased by the user from a retailer (i.e., not manufactured by the user). Here, the manufacturing process that was performed upon the raw materials did transform the raw materials into something that was not purchased from a retailer. As a result, the conversion of raw materials into identifiably distinguishable personal property excludes the raw materials from continued taxability under the use tax.
