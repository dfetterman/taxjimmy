Destination Ohio law requires the use of destination-based sourcing for interstate sales. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.033(B)(2); Ohio Information Release ST 2009-03. Initially, Ohio enacted supplemental legislation that delayed implementation of the destination-based sourcing rules until May 1, 2006. H.B. 204, enacted August 5, 2004, delayed the sourcing effective date to July 1, 2005. S.B. 26, enacted June 2, 2005, delayed the sourcing implementation until May 1, 2006, for most vendors, and 2008 for vendors with less than $30 million in delivery sales in 2005 and less than$5 million delivery sales in 2006. On April 18, 2008, Ohio enacted legislation designed to move forward with efforts to comply with the provisions relating to sourcing under the Streamlined Sales Tax System. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.033 as amended by H.B. 429, enacted April 18, 2008 and effective Jan. 1, 2010. Ohio enacted legislation moving the state to origin based sourcing for all intrastate sales, effective Jan. 1, 2010. To help vendors make the transition, beginning July 1, 2009, vendors that received temporary compensation for converting to destination-based sourcing under former law could apply for one time compensation to assist in complying with the origin-based sourcing requirements pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.061, as amended by H.B. 429, enacted April 18, 2008; see also Ohio Dept. of Taxn., Information Release ST 2009-01 (July 2009), which dealt with the one-time vendor compensation. Additionally, the temporary compensation provided to vendors to assist them with the prior transition to destination based sourcing ended, effective Jan. 1, 2010 see Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5703.70, as amended by H.B. 429, enacted April 18, 2008 and effective Jan. 1, 2010. The Streamlined Sales Tax Agreement requires that member states use a uniform manner to determine the source of sales, which is generally defined in the agreement as a destination-based sourcing rule, but provides for an option for states with local taxing jurisdictions to use an origin basis for sourcing intrastate sales. Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, as amended through Dec. 14, 2018. Sales of tangible personal property that are made by out-of-state sellers to Ohio consumers will be sourced to the location where the consumer receives the tangible personal property that was sold. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.033(C)(2); Ohio Information Release ST 2009-03. If this is not known to the seller, the seller should use an address of the consumer available from the seller's business records. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.033(C)(3); Ohio Information Release ST 2009-03. Ohio has implemented special rules for sourcing sales by marketplace facilitators.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Services

Destination Sales of services are sourced to the location where the consumer receives the service. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.033(C)(2); Ohio Information Release ST 2009-03. Under Ohio law, a service is received where the customer makes first use of the service. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.033(C)(2); Ohio Information Release ST 2009-03. For sourcing purposes, whether the service provider is located within Ohio or outside Ohio is irrelevant; the relevant issue is the location where the consumer receives the service. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.033(C)(2); Ohio Information Release ST 2009-03. For example, sales of automatic data processing services, building maintenance, employment placement, landscaping and lawn care services, exterminating services, private investigation, and security services are consummated at the consumer's location where the service is performed or received. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.033(C). Depending on the facts and circumstances, the sales of warranty, maintenance, or service contracts can be viewed as consummated at the vendor's location, the customer's location, or in the case of motor vehicles, the county of titling. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.033(C). Sourcing Rules Applicable to Telecommunications Ohio sourcing rules for telecommunications service comply with the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.034(C),(D), and (E); Ohio Information Release ST 2003-09. Except as otherwise provided, sales of telecommunications services on a call-by-call basis are sourced to each level of taxing jurisdiction where the call originates and terminates, or each level of taxing jurisdiction where the call either originates or terminates and in which the service address also is located. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.034(C). A sale of telecommunications services other than on a call-by-call basis is sourced to the customer's place of primary use. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.034(D). Telecommunication services are considered sold on a call-by-call basis when any method of charging for telecommunications services measures the price by individual calls. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.034(A)(2). For purposes of sourcing sales of telecommunication services, service address under Ohio law is defined as follows:• the location of the telecommunications equipment to which a customer's call is charged and from which the call originates or terminates, regardless of where the call is billed or paid; • if the location above is not known, “service address” means the origination point of the signal of the telecommunications service first identified by either the seller's telecommunications system or in information received by the seller from its service provider, where the system used to transport such signals is not that of the seller; • if neither of the above locations is known, “service address” means the location of the customer's place of primary use. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.034(A)(9). Under Ohio law, place of primary use is the street address representative of where the customer's use of the telecommunications service primarily occurs, which must be the residential street address or the primary business street address of the customer. With respect to mobile telecommunications services, which is discussed in further detail below, a customer's place of primary use must be within the licensed service area of the home service provider. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.034(A)(6). A sale of post-paid calling services is sourced to the origination point of the telecommunications signal as first identified by the service provider's telecommunications system, or information received by the seller from its service provider, when the system used to transport the signals is not that of the seller. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.034(E)(2). A sale of prepaid calling service or prepaid wireless calling service is sourced in the same manner as the sale of tangible personal property under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.033(C). However, in the case of prepaid wireless calling service, the service provider may elect to source the sale to the location associated with the mobile telephone number rather than as otherwise provided in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.033(C)(5). Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.034(E)(3). Under Ohio law, when a sale of a private communication service is made, the sale is sourced as follows:• service for a separate charge related to a customer channel termination point is sourced to each level of jurisdiction in which the customer channel termination point is located; • service when all customer channel termination points are located entirely within one jurisdiction or level of jurisdiction shall be sourced in the jurisdiction in which the customer channel termination points are located; or • service for segments of a channel between two customer channel termination points located in different jurisdictions and which segments of a channel are separately charged shall be sourced 50 percent in each level of jurisdiction in which the customer channel termination points are located; • service for segments of a channel located in more than one jurisdiction or level of jurisdiction and which segments are not separately billed shall be sourced in each jurisdiction based on the percentage determined by dividing the number of customer channel termination points in the jurisdiction by the total number of customer channel termination points. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.034(E)(4). Mobile Telecommunications Service Sourcing Rules The Federal Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act is a federal act that provides sourcing rules specific to mobile telecommunications services. In compliance with the Federal Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act, Ohio law provides that sales of mobile telecommunications service, other than air-to-ground radiotelephone service and prepaid calling service, are sourced to the customer's place of primary use. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.034(E)(1); Ohio Information Release ST 2003-09. Ohio has implemented special rules for sourcing sales by marketplace facilitators. For more information, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Ohio 3.1.2.5.2. BNA-SUTN OH 4.1.2.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Leases and Rentals

Depends Leases or rentals are sourced depending on whether the agreement requires recurring periodic payments. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.033(I). Sourcing also depends on whether the lease is subject to accelerated tax. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.033(I). Leases or rentals that do not require recurring periodic payments are sourced in accordance with the generally destination-based rules for sourcing sales pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.033(C). Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.033(I)(1). For the lease or rental of tangible personal property requiring recurring periodic payments, other than the lease of motor vehicles and transportation equipment, the initial payment is sourced in accordance with the generally destination-based rules for sourcing sales pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.033(C). Subsequent payments are sourced to the primary property location for the period covered by the installment. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.033(I)(2)(b)(ii). While with most leases, vendors must collect sales tax on each payment, Ohio accelerates the tax payment to the inception of the lease of motor vehicles, watercraft, outboard motors, aircraft, and tangible personal property used for business purposes. This applies if the lease has a fixed term of more than 30 days or an indefinite term with a minimum of 30 days. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.033(I)(2). For example, a 60-day lease of a motor vehicle designed to carry a load of no more than one ton of aircraft other than “transportation equipment” as defined in the statute requires an accelerated tax payment. The tax is based on the total amount of the consideration of the lease. This lease is sourced to the primary property location at the time the lease or rental is consummated. Subsequent taxable charges not calculated at the time the lease is executed are sourced to the primary property location at the time the charges are incurred. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.02(A)(2); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.033(I)(2)(a)(i); Ohio Information Release ST 2009-03. For transportation equipment, the lease is sourced in accordance with the generally destination-based sourcing rules found in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.033(C). Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.033(H)(2); Ohio Information Release ST 2009-03. BNA-SUTN OH 4.1.3.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Local Sourcing

Origin Ohio vendors of tangible personal property source their sales to Ohio consumers to the location where the vendors receive the order from the consumer. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.033(B)(1); Ohio Information Release ST 2009-03. Vendors that had previously switched to destination sourcing for delivery sales under previous Ohio law are required to source their sales to the location where the order is received rather than the delivery location. Ohio Information Release ST 2009-03. Vendors that make sales of tangible personal property in Ohio, but do not make those sales from a fixed location, are required to source each sale to the location where the sale takes place. Ohio Information Release ST 2009-03. Remote sales of tangible personal property that are made by Ohio vendors to Ohio consumers, such as sales made by mail order, telephone, or online, are sourced to the location where the order is received. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.033(B)(3); Ohio Information Release ST 2009-03. The place where the order is received is not necessarily the location from which orders are processed or shipped. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.033(B)(3). If the order is received at a location outside Ohio or the vendor does not capture the location where the order is received, the sale is treated as a sale from outside Ohio. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.033(B)(2); Ohio Information Release ST 2009-03. Sales of tangible personal property made by Ohio vendors that the vendor sends or delivers to non-Ohio customers are treated as sales made in interstate commerce and are not subject to Ohio tax. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.033(B)(2); Ohio Information Release ST 2009-03. However, Ohio vendors should check with the states into which they ship tangible personal property to determine whether or not they are required to collect tax for those states. Effective January 1, 2010, Ohio completed its legislative transition to return to origin-based sourcing for intrastate sales as permitted under the Streamlined Sales Tax Agreement. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.033(B)(1); Ohio Information Release ST 2009-03. BNA-SUTN OH 4.1.4.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Credit for Tax Paid to Another Jurisdiction

Yes Ohio allows a reciprocal use tax credit up to the amount of any sales or use tax paid to another state. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.02(C)(5); Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Taxability Matrix, Ohio (version 2018.0). The credit equals the amount of tax paid to the other jurisdiction based on the purchase or sale price. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.02(C)(5); Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Taxability Matrix, Ohio (version 2018.0). If the amount of use tax imposed by Ohio exceeds the amount paid to another state, the difference is allocated proportionally (based on the jurisdiction's tax rates)between state and local taxing authorities. In addition to state taxes paid, Ohio allows a taxpayer to take a credit against Ohio state taxes due for local taxes paid as well as taxes paid to the District of Columbia. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.02(C)(5); Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Taxability Matrix, Ohio (version 2018.0). BNA-SUTN OH 4.2.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Temporary Presence, In-Transit Property Tangible Personal Property Temporarily Stored In-state

Depends Generally, Ohio imposes a use tax on the storage, use, or other consumption of tangible personal property. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.02(A)(1). However, effective Oct. 1, 2019, Ohio exempts sales of tangible personal property that is not required to be registered or licensed under the laws of this state to a citizen of a foreign nation that is not a citizen of the United States, provided the property is delivered to a person in this state that is not a related member of the purchaser, is physically present in this state for the sole purpose of temporary storage and package consolidation, and is subsequently delivered to the purchaser at a delivery address in a foreign nation. “Temporary storage” means the storage of tangible personal property for a period of not more than 60 days. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.02(B)(38), as added by 2019 Ohio H.B. 166, effective Oct. 1, 2019. BNA-SUTN OH 4.3.2.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Temporary Presence, In-Transit Property Tangible Personal Property Purchased for Use Out-of-state

Depends Ohio exempts sales of tangible personal property manufactured in the state, if the property is sold by the manufacturer in Ohio to a retailer for use in the retail business of the retailer outside of Ohio, and if possession is taken from the manufacturer by the purchaser within Ohio for the sole purpose of immediately removing the same from Ohio in a vehicle owned by the purchaser. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.02(B)(21). Additionally, sales of tangible personal property made by Ohio vendors that the vendor sends or delivers to non-Ohio customers are treated as sales made in interstate commerce and are not subject to Ohio tax. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.033(B)(2); Ohio Admin. Code §5703-9-39; Ohio Information Release ST 2009-03. Also, transient use of tangible personal property in Ohio by a nonresident tourist or vacationer, or a nonbusiness use within Ohio by a nonresident, if the property was purchased outside Ohio for use outside Ohio and is not required to be registered or licensed under the laws of Ohio, is exempt from use tax. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.02(C)(4). BNA-SUTN OH 4.3.3.
