Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Real Property

Exempt Real property is not subject to sales and use tax in Idaho. Idaho Code §63-3619(a); Idaho Code §63-3621; Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.067.02. Real property is defined as “land and all standing timber…, and all buildings, structures and improvements, or other fixtures of whatsoever kind on land … and all other property which the law defines, or the courts may interpret, declare and hold to be real property under the letter, spirit, intent and meaning of the law.” Idaho Code §63-108. In Idaho, “tangible personal property” means personal property which may be seen, weighed, measured, felt or touched, or which is in any other manner perceptible to the senses. “Tangible personal property”includes any computer software that is not a custom computer program and is not application software accessed over the internet or through wireless media. Effective April 1, 2015, tangible personal property also includes digital music, digital books, digital videos and digital games when the purchaser has a permanent right to use such software and, regardless of the method of delivery or access. If the right to use digital music, digital books, digital videos or digital games is conditioned upon continued payment from the purchaser it is not a permanent right of use. Idaho Code §63-3616(a); Idaho Code §63-3616(b), as amended by 2014 Idaho H. 598, effective July 1, 2014; as further amended by 2015 Idaho H. 209, effective April 1, 2015. BNA-SUTN ID 28.1.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal General Rule for Classification

Exempt Fixtures which are physically attached to the land or other improvements affixed to the land in such a manner that it may not be removed without materially damaging the real property or is of such a nature that it would normally be expected to be sold together with the land is not subject to sales and use tax in Idaho. Idaho Code §63-3619(a); Idaho Code §63-3621; Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.067.01.a. The Three Part Test Idaho courts have developed a three part test used to determine when tangible personal property becomes a fixture. The three parts of the test are: • annexation of the tangible personal property to the real property, either actually or constructively; • adoption or application of the item to the use or purpose that the part of the real property to which it is connected is appropriated; and • intention to make the item a permanent accession to the freehold. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.067.02; see also Marcum, Inc. v. Idaho State Tax Comn., Docket No. 90030 (Idaho Dist. Ct., Ada County Dec. 12, 1990) (citing Beebe v. Pioneer Bank & Trust Co., 201 P. 717 (Idaho 1921). The first prong of the test refers to the actual relationship of the tangible personal property to the real property at issue. Constructive annexation occurs when the tangible personal property, although not physically attached to the real property, is an essential, necessary, integral, or working part of some other object that is physically attached to the real property. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.067.02; see also Marcum, Inc., Docket No. 90030(Idaho Dist. Ct., Ada Cnty., Dec. 12, 1990) (citing Rayl v. Shull Enter., Inc., 700 P.2d 567 (Idaho 1984). The second prong of the test is satisfied when the tangible personal property is clearly adapted to the use to which the real property is devoted. Thus, tangible personal property may become a fixture “if it is a necessary or at least a useful adjunct to the [real property], considering the purpose to which the [real property] is devoted.” Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.067.02; see also Marcum, Inc., Docket No. 90030(Idaho Dist. Ct., Ada Cnty. Dec. 12, 1990) (citations omitted in original). See also Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.067.06; Idaho Commission Decisions Docket No. 1-987-735-552 (Nov. 29, 2017) (‘store fixtures,’ which benefit the business occupying a building and not the realty itself, are not adapted to the use of the real estate and are therefore personal property). The third prong of the test is generally considered the most important of the three. The intent of the individual who affixed the tangible personal property is judged objectively as manifested and implied by the individual's act. “Thus the intent should be determined from surrounding circumstances at the time of installation….” Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.067.02; see also Marcum, Inc., Docket No. 90030(Idaho Dist. Ct., Ada County Dec. 12, 1990) (citations omitted in original). BNA-SUTN ID 28.2.1.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal Sale and Installation of Appliances, Electronics, Machinery, and Equipment

Depends The taxability of the sale and installation of appliances, electronics, machinery, and equipment depends on whether the items retain their character as tangible personal property. Idaho Code §63-3619(a); Idaho Code §63-3621; Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.067.01.a. A regular over-the-counter sale of tangible personal property with an agreement to install it is not a contract to improve real property if the item does not become affixed to realty. This applies to sales of stoves, refrigerators, washing machines, dryers, and other electrical appliances. In this case, tax is collected from the buyer by the seller on the retail sales price of the item. If the installation charges are properly separated, tax is due only on the cost of the unit. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.014.06. Fiber optic and communication cable installed in a building is presumed to be a real property improvement. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.067. Editor's Note: Although this rule was adopted by the Idaho State Tax Commission, it will not become final until approved by the state legislature, effective at the conclusion of the 2018 legislative session.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Construction Materials and Contracts Construction Materials and Contracts, Generally

Depends Improvements and repair to real property are considered construction contracting services not subject to sales tax in Idaho. Idaho Code §63-3612(1); Idaho Code §63-3613; Idaho Code §63-3619; Idaho Code §63-3621. In Idaho, contractors who build, improve, repair or alter real property are the consumers of all the goods they use. As a result, they must pay sales tax on all purchases, including all the equipment, tools, and supplies they use to build, improve, repair, or alter real property. Contractors must also pay sales tax when they buy building materials and fixtures. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.012.06. Idaho law states that any person engaged in the business of constructing, altering, repairing, or improving real property is the end user or consumer of all tangible personal property used in rendering their service. Idaho Code §63-3609(a); Idaho Commission Decisions Docket No. 25481 (the service of improving real property is not subject to sales tax; the contractor owes tax on materials used in the provision of the service). Contractors are defined as people engaged in the business of performing contract work or residential repairs upon real property. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.012.01.a; Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.012.01.b; see also Idaho Commission Decisions Docket No. 24442 (Mar. 22, 2013) (subcontractor liable for use tax on all materials it consumed pursuant to contract, even those materials provided from the inventory of the project owner). Contractors are consumers of equipment used in construction business such as trucks, tractors, road graders, scaffolding, pipe cutters, trowels, wrenches, tools in general, oxygen, acetylene, oil, and similar items. They must pay sales or use tax on their purchase of equipment, tools, fixtures, fuels, and supplies. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.012.06; Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.012.07. Improvements to Real Property Contractors making improvements to real property cannot charge their customers for materials used to improve the real property. Idaho State Tax Comn., Contractors and Sales Tax. They must either pay sales tax to their own vendor, or pay use tax to Idaho on all purchases of materials use. If a contractor improperly charges sales tax to a customer, the customer may refuse to pay it or request a refund for it later. Idaho State Tax Comn., Contractors and Sales Tax; Idaho Tax Update for January 2017. Additionally, if a contractor buys or receives materials and equipment on which no one paid sales or use tax, the contractor owes use tax on the purchase. Idaho State Tax Comn., Contractors Working in Idaho. Contractors' Exempt Purchases A contractor can buy materials tax-exempt if the contractor will install them into real property either in a state that does not have a sales tax or in a state where the materials would not be subject to a use tax or other similar excise tax. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.012.13. This exemption only applies to materials incorporated into real estate in a non-taxing state. Tools, supplies, equipment, or any other tangible personal property purchased in Idaho that are not incorporated into realty are taxable when purchased in Idaho. In order to grant this exemption the retailer must have a properly completed exemption certificate on file. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.012.13; Idaho Commission Decisions Docket No. 39253 (June 29, 2016). By definition, the term “use” includes the exercise of any right or power over tangible personal property by any person in the performance of a contract, or to fulfill contract or subcontract obligations whether title to the property be in the subcontractor, contractor, contractee or any other party. Idaho Code §63-3615(b); Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.072.02. Contracts for the improvement of real property include lump sum contracts, cost-plus contracts, guaranteed price contracts, time and materials contracts. As stated above, contractors are considered to be responsible for paying the use tax on all items used in a real property contract regardless of who owns the material used in the completion of the contract (including leased material)and regardless of the type of real property contract. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.012.03; see also Idaho Commission Decisions Docket No. 18133 (Feb. 15, 2005); Idaho Commission Decisions Docket No. 25235. Custom-Made Goods Idaho sales and use tax applies to the price for custom-made goods. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.012.08. Land Leveling Persons who contract to level land are improving real property, and are thus considered contractors. Equipment, materials, and supplies purchased for land leveling are subject to tax. Contractors who crush rock are performing a nontaxable service if the rock is obtained on a construction site, and the crushed rock is used on the same site for purposes such as backfill, land leveling, site preparation, or site cleanup. The use of such rock, backfill, or other related materials is not subject to tax. However, such a contractor is not primarily devoted to mining and his use of rock crushing equipment, or other equipment and supplies, does not qualify for an exemption under Idaho Code § 63-3622D. Additionally, the sale or use of crushed rock that is removed from a construction side and used elsewhere is taxable. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.012.12. Value for Use Tax Computation Contractors are responsible for paying use tax on the value of all materials and supplies used in the performance of a construction contract. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.012.09. When a contractor fabricates tangible personal property for incorporation into real property under a specific construction contract, the value of the fabricated property subject to tax includes only the contractor's material costs, and does not include the cost to the contractor of fabrication labor. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.012.09.a;Idaho State Tax Comn., Contractors Working in Idaho. Where the contractor is also a retailer of tangible personal property, and the contractor fabricates tangible personal property and places it in inventory for future use, the contractor will be subject to use tax on the “fabricated value” of the property if later withdrawn from inventory for incorporation into real property. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.012.09.b;Idaho State Tax Comn., Contractors Working in Idaho. In this case, the fabricated value subject to use tax includes the contractor's material costs as well as the cost to the contractor of fabrication labor.

Nontaxable In Idaho, repairs to real property are not taxable. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.012.01; Idaho Sales and Use Tax Publication Contractors Working in Idaho. Contractors who build, improve, repair or alter real property are the consumers of all the goods they use. As a result, they must pay sales tax on all purchases, including all the equipment, tools, and supplies they use to build, improve, repair, or alter real property. Contractors must also pay sales tax when they buy building materials and fixtures. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.012.01; Idaho Sales and Use Tax Publication Contractors Working in Idaho. Repair should be distinguished from taxable forms of labor such as fabrication, which involve the creation of new tangible personal property. These two types of labor are easily misidentified because repair work can result in materials used appearing to create tangible personal property. The analysis turns on:• whether the addition of materials creates tangible personal property separate from the item ostensibly being repaired; or • whether the labor materially enhances the use for which the tangible personal property was originally produced. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.062.06. The creation of an item of tangible personal property separable and independent from the original constitutes taxable fabrication labor, as does the enhancement of an item of tangible personal property beyond its original intended use.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Contractor Classifications

Defined Contractors construct, alter, repair, or improve real property. Contractors are defined as consumers of materials they use, whether or not they resell the material. All sales of tangible personal property to contractors are taxable. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.012.01. Contractors include bricklayers, plumbers, heating specialists, painters, sheet metal workers, carpet layers, electricians, land levelers, well drillers, landscapers, and all others who do contract work on real property. Unless these persons are employees of a contractor, they are acting as contractors and are consumers just as other contractors. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.012.01. People who perform residential repairs, such as plumbers and electricians, as well as those who both sell and install carpet are also contractors improving real property. These contractors are defined as the consumers of the materials they install and are required to pay sales or use tax on their cost for the materials. They do not charge sales tax to their customers unless they make a sale of materials only, with no installation. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.012.01. The terms “contractor” and “subcontractor”are not applicable to persons who merely sell tangible personal property in the form of building materials, supplies, or equipment to construction contractors for delivery at the job site without any requirement that they install such tangible personal property. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.012.01.c; Idaho Commission Decisions Docket No. 0-158-775-296 (Nov. 29, 2018) (contractor who purchased building materials was liable for use tax on the sales price, not the raw materials price, because the supplier was not a subcontractor and therefore the purchase was a retail sale). In many scenarios, a contractor is also engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail. Such contractors must have a sales tax permit and report sales tax on any sales made at retail. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.014.02. Such contractors may purchase all tangible personal property to be sold at retail exempt from tax as a sale for resale. If a contractor subsequently withdraws tangible personal property from their untaxed inventory for use in the performance of a construction contract, the contractor is responsible for remitting use tax. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.014.04. BNA-SUTN ID 28.5.

Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.012.11; Idaho Commission Decisions Docket No. 25481. Examples of subcontractors include bricklayers, plumbers, painters, landscapers, well drillers, electricians, and carpet installers. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.012.01. The terms “contractor” and “subcontractor”are not applicable to persons who merely sell tangible personal property in the form of building materials, supplies, or equipment to construction contractors for delivery at the job site without any requirement that they install such tangible personal property. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.012.01.c. BNA-SUTN ID 28.6.
