Disaster Relief/Proposed Nexus Change Disaster Relief In 2016, New Mexico enacted legislation providing an exception from its nexus provisions for businesses temporarily present in the state to perform disaster relief work. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-83, as added by 2016 N.M. S.B. 19, effective May 18, 2016. Effective May 18, 2016, an out-of-state business that conducts operations within New Mexico for purposes of performing disaster or emergency-related work in response to a declared state disaster or emergency during the disaster response period is not considered to have established a level of presence that would require the business to register for, file, or remit state or local taxes or fees. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-83, as added by 2016 N.M. S.B. 19, effective May 18, 2016. This includes gross receipts taxes or use tax on equipment brought into the state temporarily for use during the disaster response period and subsequently removed from the state. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-1-83, as added by 2016 N.M. S.B. 19, effective May 18, 2016. Sales and Use Tax Nexus In May 2017, the New Mexico legislature introduced and passed legislation that would have dramatically expanded the definition of “engaging in business” in the state. Under this provision, for sales made into New Mexico by out-of-state vendors, the “place of business” would be the delivery location. This would have effectively expanded New Mexico's nexus standard to all remote sellers delivering taxable property or services within the state. In the same bill, the legislature created an exception for vendors without a physical presence in New Mexico who had less than $100,000 of gross receipts in the state. The ultimate result of this legislation would have been to create an economic nexus standard similar to that passed in South Dakota. Although the governor signed the bill into law, the portions relating to nexus were vetoed and are thus not in effect. The U.S. Supreme Court's decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. regarding South Dakota's economic nexus law may open the door for another attempt at passing economic nexus legislation in New Mexico. New Mexico Legislature, 2017 N.M. H.B. 2, First Special Session (nexus provisions vetoed); see South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., No. 17-494, 2018 BL 219995 (June 21, 2018).
