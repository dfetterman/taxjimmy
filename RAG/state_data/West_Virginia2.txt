Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-9c.1.5. • makes purchases of tangible personal property or services, the use of which is unknown to the purchaser at the time of the purchase and one of the reasonably foreseeable uses would render the purchase exempt from consumers sales and service tax and use tax; and W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-9c.1.6. • makes purchases of tangible personal property or services that are used in both exempt and taxable manners and who must pay tax on an apportionment basis. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-9c.1.7. Each direct pay permit granted is valid until surrendered by the holder or cancelled for cause by the Commissioner. The Commissioner is entitled to promulgate rules determining those activities that will cause cancellation of a direct pay permit. Once a permit is issued, payment of the tax imposed or assertion of the exemptions allowed under West Virginia law is to be made directly to the tax commissioner by the permit holder. W. Va. Code §11-15-9d(c). A direct pay permit may be cancelled or not renewed for cause. Cause includes any one of the following:• the direct pay permit holder is delinquent by more than 30 days in the payment of any tax imposed by Chapter 11 of the West Virginia Code(taxation); W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-9c.5.1.1. • the direct pay permit holder utilizes the permit in any unauthorized manner, including but not limited to making purchases of items for personal use or consumption by an individual officer, employee, or proprietor of a business or organization when the permit is issued to the business or organization; W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-9c.5.1.2. or • the direct pay permit holder fails to file a direct pay return for any period within five days after the date due. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-9c.5.1.3. On or before the 20th day of each month, every permit holder is required to make and file a consumers sales and use tax direct pay permit return for the preceding month to the tax commissioner. This return must show the total value of the tangible personal property used, the amount of taxable services purchased, and the amount of consumers sales and use taxes due from the permit holder. The taxes due are to be paid to the tax commissioner with the return. If the amount of consumers sales and use taxes due averages less than $250 per month, the tax commissioner may permit the filing of quarterly returns in lieu of monthly returns and the amount of tax shown on the returns to be due must be remitted on or before the 15th day following the close of the calendar quarter. If the amount due averages less than $150 per calendar quarter, the tax commissioner may permit the filing of an annual direct pay permit return and the amount of tax shown on the return to be due must be remitted on or before 30 days after the end of the permit holder's tax year for federal and state income tax purposes. The tax commissioner may, by non-emergency legislative rules, change the minimum amounts for eligibility to file quarterly or annual returns. Additionally, the tax commissioner, on written request by the permit holder, may grant a reasonable extension of time, on terms as the tax commissioner may require, for making and filing direct pay permit returns and paying the tax due. Interest on the tax is chargeable on every extended payment. W. Va. Code §11-15-9d(b). Direct pay permits are valid until expiration of the taxpayer's registration year. Permits are automatically renewed when the taxpayer's business registration certificate is issued for the next succeeding fiscal year, unless the permit is surrendered by the holder or cancelled for cause by the tax commissioner. W. Va. Code §11-15-9d(c). Holders of a direct payment permit are not required to pay the tax to the vendor. Permit holders must notify each vendor from whom tangible personal property is purchased or leased or from whom services are purchased of their direct payment permit number and that the tax is being paid directly to the tax commissioner. Once notice is given, the vendor is absolved from all duties and liabilities imposed by the sales and service tax for the collection and remittance of the tax with respect to sales and services furnished to the permit holder. In such situations, vendors must maintain records that show the amount involved and identity of each purchaser. W. Va. Code §11-15-9d(d). BNA-SUTN WV 31.8.10.

The tax commissioner is authorized to examine the books, papers, records, and equipment of any person who either (1) is selling tangible personal property or taxable services; W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-14.2.2.1. or (2) is liable for the use tax. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-14.2.2.2. If a taxpayer's records are inadequate to accurately reflect its business operations, an auditor with the tax commissioner's office will determine the best information available and will base an audit report on that information. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-14b.4; West Virginia Office of Tax Appeals Decision Docket No. 12-179 CU (Feb. 25, 2013); see West Virginia Office of Tax Appeals Decision Docket No. 12-388 P (Dec. 4, 2013)(auditor's investigation revealed that taxpayer recorded a fraction of total sales at its restaurant, with this knowledge, a much larger-scale audit was conducted to determine back taxes owed). The tax commissioner may investigate the character of the business of any taxpayer to verify the accuracy of any return made. Similarly, if no return was made by such person, the Commissioner has authority to ascertain and determine the amount of use tax due. With reasonable notice, any such books, papers, and records must be made available within the state for examination. However, when the taxpayer's records must be kept out-of-state, the taxpayer may elect to do one of the following: • transport the required records to a convenient point in West Virginia and notify the tax commissioner of the location where such records are available;or • pay the reasonable traveling expenses of the tax commissioner's representatives from Charleston, West Virginia, to the out-of-state place where the records are kept, and the return of such representative to Charleston, West Virginia. In addition to travel expenses, the taxpayer must make available reasonable living expenses for the state representatives while engaged in the examination of records. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-14.2.2.2. When the taxpayer's records are absent or unusable, the tax commissioner may observe the business to ascertain a sample set of gross receipts from which to extrapolate an estimate of annual gross receipts on which tax is due.
