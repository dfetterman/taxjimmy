Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal General Rule for Classification

Three-part Test South Dakota applies a three-part test when classifying property as tangible personal property or a fixture to real property. See In re Diagnostic Med. Sys., Inc., 415 N.W.2d 816 (S.D. 1987) (quoting McCulloch Gas Processing Corp. v. Butte County, 331 N.W.2d 281, 282-83 (S.D. 1983). To determine whether an article is a fixture, South Dakota considers:• annexation to the realty, either actual or constructive; • its adaptability to the use and purpose for which the realty is used;and • the intention of the party making the annexation. In re Diagnostic Med. Sys., Inc., 415 N.W.2d 816 (S.D. 1987) (quoting McCulloch Gas Processing Corp. v. Butte County, 331 N.W.2d 281, 282-83 (S.D. 1983). The intention of the party with regard to making the article a permanent accession to the realty is the controlling criterion. Intention is deduced from the relation of the parties and the circumstances of a particular case. In re Diagnostic Med. Sys., Inc., 415 N.W.2d 816 (S.D. 1987) (quoting McCulloch Gas Processing Corp. v. Butte County, 331 N.W.2d 281, 282-83 (S.D. 1983). BNA-SUTN SD 28.2.1.

R. 64:09:01:16; South Dakota Contractors'Excise Tax Guide—July 2017; South Dakota Contractor's Excise Tax Guide—July 2018. Instead of imposing sales and use tax on construction contracts, South Dakota imposes a 2 percent excise tax on the gross receipts of all prime contractors on construction projects undertaken within the state. The excise tax applies to the original contract and any change orders to the contract. For projects other than qualified utility projects, subcontractors are not subject to the 2 percent excise tax, so long as the prime contractor issues them a prime contractors' exemption certificate.

Where a property owner furnishes materials but fails to document that sales and use tax was paid, the prime contractor owes state use tax and any applicable municipal use tax on such materials. Documentation may include a copy of the invoice showing tax or a written statement from the owner that sales or use tax was paid. Contractors will owe use tax on material furnished by a government or other sales-tax-exempt entity, because the government or other entity will not have paid sales tax at the time of purchase.

All materials and services purchased to construct a manufactured (HUD) home may be purchased for resale. The dealer may purchase the manufactured(HUD) home without tax from the manufacturer. Furniture and accessories sold with a manufactured (HUD) home are subject to tax. South Dakota Tax Facts No. 221; South Dakota Tax Facts —Manufactured and Modular Homes. Contractors hired to install or setup a mobile or manufactured home should document in the contract or invoice that the receipts are for the setup or installation of a mobile or manufactured (HUD) home. The contractor owes sales or use tax on the material they provide to setup or install the home. South Dakota Tax Facts No. 221; South Dakota Tax Facts —Manufactured and Modular Homes. In a bulletin, South Dakota explains several other topics that are relevant to manufactured and mobile homes. For example, the bulletin explains that a transportation company's or house mover's receipts for moving a mobile or manufactured HUD home are not subject to sales tax or contractors' excise tax. It also explains the tax liabilities on the construction, sale, and installation of a modular or sectional home or a house on blocks built to Uniform Building Code (UBC) or other local building code standards. South Dakota Tax Facts No. 221; South Dakota Tax Facts —Manufactured and Modular Homes. Defined Terms South Dakota defines the terms “manufactured(HUD) home,” “mobile home,” “sectional home,”and “permanent foundation.” South Dakota Tax Facts No. 221. A mobile home (built prior to 1977) is a portable unit, designed and constructed to be towed on its own chassis (comprised of frame and wheels), and designed to be connected to utilities for year round occupancy. Mobile homes are titled. S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §32-3-1(8). The term includes:• units containing parts that may be folded, collapsed, or telescoped when being towed and that may be expanded to provide additional cubic capacity;and • units composed of two or more separately towable components designed to be joined into one integral unit capable of being separated again into the components for repeated towing. S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §32-3-1(8). A manufactured (HUD) home is a portable structure that sits on its own chassis (frames and wheels) and can be towed from one location to another. When it is in a stationary location, you can hook up utilities and live in it year-round. Manufactured homes are built to Housing and Urban Development (HUD) standards and can be used for residential, commercial, educational, or industrial purposes. They might be one unit (like single-wides) or made up of several units (like double-or triplewides) that can be towed separately, connected to form a single structure, and then later disconnected and towed somewhere else. S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §32-3-1(6). A sectional home (UBC) means any home pre-built in part or in whole for the purpose of permanent placement on a foundation. A sectional home is not a manufactured home or a mobile home. S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §10-45-2.1; S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §10-46-5.1; South Dakota Tax Facts No. 221; South Dakota Tax Facts —Manufactured and Modular Homes. A permanent foundation is a continuous perimeter weight bearing foundation supporting a sectional home and engineered to resist the imposition of external forces such as rain, wind and snow. The perimeter foundation walls shall be supported by footings placed below the normal frost line. The sectional home shall be attached and physically secured to the foundation. S.D. Admin. R. 64:06:03:63. Portable Sheds and Buildings The sale of portable sheds and buildings are subject to sales tax on the full selling price, plus any delivery charges. This includes buildings, built in whole or part, that are to be moved to another location, such as utility sheds, tool sheds, or prewired utility buildings. Sales tax applies based on where these buildings are delivered. This tax application does not apply to construction trailers, which are manufactured homes or motor vehicles, or sectional homes.
