Vendor Liability for Sales Tax Under Connecticut law, the sales tax is imposed directly on the retailer as a privilege tax for the privilege of making taxable sales within Connecticut. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-408(1). However, retailers are statutorily authorized to pass the tax on to the retailer's customers, and the tax becomes a debt recoverable at law from the purchaser to the retailer. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-408(2)(A). Liability for Use Tax Every person storing, accepting, consuming, or otherwise using in Connecticut services or tangible personal property purchased from a retailer for storage, acceptance, consumption, or any other use in Connecticut is liable for payment of the state use tax.

Depends Under Connecticut law, the sales tax is imposed directly on the retailer as a privilege tax for the privilege of making taxable sales within Connecticut. However, retailers are statutorily authorized to pass the tax on to the retailer's customers, and the tax becomes a debt recoverable at law from the purchaser to the retailer. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-408. Additionally, every person storing, accepting, consuming, or otherwise using in Connecticut services or tangible personal property purchased from a retailer for storage, acceptance, consumption, or any other use in Connecticut is liable for payment of the state use tax. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-411(2). Connecticut taxpayers who do not pay Connecticut sales or use tax on out-of-state or online purchases must disclose and pay use tax on those untaxed purchases. Taxpayers must file Schedule 4 of Form CT-1040 when filing their Individual Income Tax returns, or be subject to civil or criminal liability. Connecticut Dept. of Rev. Svcs., Have You Made Purchases Out-of-State or Online? (Mar. 2, 2018); Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-415; Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-416; Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-419; Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-428(2); Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2019(3) (Jan. 22, 2019). Some taxpayers may receive a bill for past use tax owed on known purchases. Such a bill is a time limited offer to the taxpayer to settle the tax deficiency by paying the tax and interest due without penalty. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-416(c) Connecticut taxpayers are warned that the Department of Revenue Services never sends bills or notices by e-mail, text messages, or social media to request personal and financial information.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Business Owners, Operators

Yes Connecticut imposes personal liability for unpaid sales taxes on certain corporate officers, supervisors, and any other individuals or entities that are in a position of authority or control and who are responsible for collecting and remitting sales taxes and who fail to do so. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-414a. Under Connecticut law, individuals or business entities are considered to be responsible for collecting and remitting sales or use tax on behalf of a retailer if they are under a duty to file a tax return on behalf of the retailer or to collect and truthfully account for and pay over sales or use tax on behalf of a retailer. To be held personally liable, the individual or business entity must have willfully failed to collect and pay the tax, or willfully failed to truthfully account for the tax. Personal liability will only be imposed to the extent the unpaid sales or use taxes cannot be recovered directly from the retail business for whom the responsible party was required to collect and remit sales or use taxes. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-414a; see Connecticut Publication DRS-045 (March 2019). The dissolution of the retailer does not discharge any person from personal liability for willful failure to collect or truthfully account for and pay over such tax or for a willful attempt to evade or defeat such tax prior to dissolution. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-414a. The amount owed by a business can only be collected one time. If the liability is collected from the business, the responsible person will be given credit on his or her personal assessment. If more than one responsible person is assessed, each one is jointly and severally liable, but the total due is collected in full only one time. Connecticut Publication DRS-045 (March 2019).

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Certificates Required

Yes Consequences of Failing to Obtain Exemption Certificate A seller who fails to obtain an exemption certificate may be held liable for the tax. A purchaser who gives a false or fraudulent exemption certificate may also be subject to civil and criminal penalties. Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2015(12). Certificate Types Connecticut's state-specific exemption certificate is the Connecticut Resale Certificate. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-426-1; Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2009(15). A resale certificate may be used as a blanket certificate for the purpose of a continuing line of purchases for resale in the regular course of business. If used as a blanket certificate, it must be plainly marked “Blanket Certificate.” Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-426-1(b). Other state specific exemption certificates include the:• Materials, Tools and Fuel in Industrial Plant (Connecticut Form CERT-100); • Machinery, Component Parts and Replacement and Repair Parts of Machinery Used Directly in a Manufacturing Process (Connecticut Form CERT-101); • Certificate for Machinery, Equipment, Materials, Tools and Fuel Used by an Aircraft Manufacturer Operating an Aircraft Manufacturing Facility (Connecticut Form CERT-111); • Certificate for Purchases of Tangible Personal Property and Services by Qualifying Exempt Organizations (Connecticut Form CERT-119); and • Contractors Exempt Purchase Certificate (Connecticut Form CERT-141). Connecticut accepts the Multistate Tax Commission's Sales & Use Tax Certificate as a valid resale certificate, but not as a valid exemption certificate for any other purpose. Connecticut is not a member of the Streamlined Sales Tax Agreement, thus sellers may not use the SSTGB's multistate certificate of exemption Form F0003. If a sale is being made in Connecticut, a seller may not accept an exemption certificate issued by another state. Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2015(12). A sale for resale may be supported by a certificate that substantially resembles the state's form and:• is signed by the issuer; • has the name and address of the issuer; • describes the general character of the property or service sold by the issuer in the regular course of business; • describes the property or service being purchased by the issuer from the seller;and • has the Connecticut Tax Registration Number as it appears on the issuer's Connecticut Sales and Use Tax Permit. Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2015(12). If issuer is an out-of-state purchaser, they may use the tax identification number issued by their home state, or if none, the Federal Employee Identification Number. If an issuer is not required to have a Connecticut Sales and Use Tax Permit, the issuer should attach a statement to the resale certificate stating that the issuer is not required to have a Connecticut Sales and Use Tax Permit because it is not making sales in Connecticut or making sales that are otherwise subject to Connecticut sales and use taxes.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Good Faith Requirement

Yes An exemption certificate relieves the seller from the burden of proof only if taken in good faith from a person engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property who at the time of purchasing the property intends to sell it in the regular course of its business or who is unable to ascertain at the time of the purchase whether the property will be sold or used for some other purpose. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-410(2). In Arkin-Medo, Inc. v. Connecticut Commissioner of Revenue Services, the Connecticut Appeals Court held that a company accepted resale certificates in good faith, reversing a trial court decision that improperly required the seller to demonstrate that the property sold is for resale. Arkin-Medo sold products such as films, tape, chemicals, and paper to commercial printers and accepted numerous resale certificates from its customers. While Arkin-Medo's customers transferred a small portion of the products (e.g., part of a roll of tape)to certain of their clients, a large percentage of the products was consumed by the purchasers in their graphics arts business. Arkin-Medo, Inc. v. Connecticut Comr. of Rev. Svcs., 684 A.2d 1220, 43 Conn. App. 598 (Conn. App. Ct. 1996), cert. denied, 240 Conn. 901, 688 A.2d 330 (Conn. 1997). The court explained that under Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-410, the certificate has been accepted in good faith and is valid “unless the seller has knowledge of facts which give rise to a reasonable inference that the purchaser does not intend to resell the property … .”Requiring the seller to ascertain the intention of the purchaser when the purchaser itself certified that it did not know how it would use the products resulted in an improper interpretation of the law, the court said. Arkin-Medo, Inc. v. Connecticut Comr. of Rev. Svcs., 684 A.2d 1220, 43 Conn. App. 598 (Conn. App. Ct. 1996), cert. denied, 240 Conn. 901, 688 A.2d 330 (Conn. 1997). BNA-SUTN CT 31.8.4.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Direct Pay Permits

Authorized The Commissioner may issue a permit if sales tax collection would not be jeopardized by the permit, issuance of the permit will reduce tax administrative costs, the purchaser's accounting system clearly indicates tax owed, and the purchases are of sufficient volume to justify the expense of regular audits. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-409a. To qualify for a direct payment permit, taxpayers must meet all of the following criteria:• a direct payment permit will not jeopardize the collection of sales and use taxes; • the business's accounting system must clearly indicate the amount of sales and use taxes owed; • the business is regularly audited by the Department; • the business will remit sales and use taxes using EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer) technology; and • the business agrees that its name may be published as a direct payment permit holder on the Department's website and in any other related publications, and may be disclosed as a direct payment permit holder in any other manner for tax administration purposes. Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2004(11); Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2004(7). The following items may not be purchased with the direct payment permit:• tangible personal property incorporated into new construction to real property; • meals or lodging; • motor vehicles, vessels, snowmobiles, and aircraft; • telecommunications services; • utilities (gas, electricity, and heating fuel); • purchases made with Procurement Cards (P-cards); and • tangible personal property consumed or incorporated in the installation, maintenance, and repair of utility mains, lines, poles, pipes, and other facilities located within a public right-of-way. Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2004(11); Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2004(7). Use Tax Credit for Direct Payment Permit Holder The Commissioner of Higher Education can select a direct payment permit holder for a pilot program. The direct payment permit holder is eligible for a use tax credit of up to $4 million against its purchases of computer equipment to be used in Connecticut in electronic commerce. The credit amount must equal the amount of the direct payment permit holder's contributions of cash, property, or services to a Connecticut public or private college or university for electronic commerce instruction projects, including investments in buildings and classrooms, computer equipment, and licenses. The credit may be taken only for completed projects. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-413b; Connecticut Special Notice SN 2001(9); Connecticut Special Notice SN 2000(3.1). BNA-SUTN CT 31.8.10.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Record-Keeping Requirements

3 Years Requirement to Maintain Records Every seller, every retailer, and every person storing, accepting, consuming, or otherwise using in Connecticut any services or tangible personal property purchased from a retailer must keep records, receipts, invoices, and other pertinent papers in such form as the Commissioner requires. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-426(3)(A). A taxpayer must maintain all records that are necessary to a determination of correct tax liability under the affected tax law provisions. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(b). Failure to maintain such records will be considered evidence of negligence or intentional disregard of law or regulation and may, without more, result in the imposition of appropriate penalties. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(b). Every taxpayer should make periodic checks on all records being retained for use by the Commissioner. If any records required to be retained are discovered to be subsequently lost, destroyed, damaged, or found to be incomplete or materially inaccurate, the taxpayer must make an accurate recreation of the lost, damaged, or destroyed files, or create an accurate record of the incomplete, missing, or inaccurate records within a reasonable period of time. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(b). Requirement to Make Records Available for Inspection All required records must be made available upon request by the Commissioner or authorized representatives. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(b); see also Alexandre v. Connecticut Comr. of Rev. Svcs., 300 Conn. 566, 22 A.3d 518 (Conn. 2011) (summary cash register tapes or “Z reports” lack the details of individual sales transactions necessary to satisfy the taxpayer's sales and use tax recordkeeping responsibilities). Such records include books of account, invoices, sales receipts, cash register tapes, purchase orders, exemption certificates, returns, and schedules and working papers used in connection with the preparation of returns. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(b). If a taxpayer retains records required to be retained in both machine-sensible and hard copy formats, the taxpayer must make the records available to the Commissioner in machine-sensible format upon request of the Commissioner. A taxpayer is in no way prohibited from demonstrating tax compliance with traditional hard copy documents or reproductions of those hard copies, in whole or in part, whether or not such taxpayer also has retained or has the capability to retain records on electronic or other storage media in accordance with these requirements. However, this permitted demonstration of compliance using traditional hard copies of documents in no way relieves a taxpayer of the obligation to comply with making the machine-sensible format of the documents available upon request of the Commissioner. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(b). Time Period for Record Retention All records required to be retained by a taxpayer are to be preserved for so long as the contents of the records may become material in the administration of taxes, but in no event should records be maintained for less than three years from the extended due date of the return, unless the Commissioner has provided in writing that the records are no longer required. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(i). Content of Records Every seller, retailer, and other person storing, accepting, consuming, or otherwise using within Connecticut services or tangible personal property purchased from a retailer is required to keep records, receipts, invoices, and other pertinent papers in a form that is adequate to demonstrate the taxpayer's tax liability or any applicable exemptions. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-426(3)(A). Special Rule for Materialmen Each materialman collecting tax as allowed under the provisions of Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-408(2)(C) must also keep with respect to each sale of building materials or services, records of the date of such sale; proof that the sale meets the qualifications for treatment under the materialman provisions; the amount of credit, if any, extended by such materialman to such contractor, subcontractor, or repairman for each such sale; the terms for payment of the purchase price or repayment of any such credit; and the date or dates on which the purchase price is paid or such credit is repaid, in whole or in part, and the amount of each payment or repayment. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-408(2)(C); Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-426(3)(B). Such records shall be kept for a period of three years from the date the tax on each such sale is paid over to the Commissioner in full, provided the Commissioner may consent to their destruction within that period or may require that they be kept longer. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-426(3)(B). Machine-Sensible Records General Requirements Machine-sensible records used to establish tax compliance must contain sufficient transaction-level detail information so that the details underlying the machine-sensible records can be identified and made available to the Commissioner upon request. A taxpayer has discretion to discard duplicated records and redundant information provided that record-keeping responsibilities are otherwise satisfied. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(c)(1)(A). “Machine-sensible record” means a collection of related information in an electronic format. Machine-sensible records do not include hard copy records that are created or recorded on paper or stored in or by an imaging system such as microfilm, microfiche, or storage-only imaging systems. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(a)(5). Upon an examination by the Commissioner of machine-sensible records, the retained records must be capable of being retrieved and converted to a standard record format. The term “standard record format” does not mean that every taxpayer must keep records in an identical manner. Rather, it means that if a taxpayer utilizes a code system to identify elements of information in each record when creating and maintaining records, the taxpayer is required to maintain a record of the meaning of each code and any code changes and provide these to the Commissioner to enable an effective review of the taxpayer's records. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(c)(1)(B). Any system used by a taxpayer for creating, maintaining, and retrieving machine-sensible records must be able to accept date information input, provide date output, and store and perform calculations on dates before, on and after Jan. 1, 2000 correctly and without ambiguity. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(c)(1)(C). Taxpayers are not required to construct machine-sensible records other than those created in the ordinary course of business. A taxpayer that does not create the electronic equivalent of a traditional paper document in the ordinary course of business is not required to construct such a record for tax purposes. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(c)(1)(D). Electronic Data Interchange Requirements “Electronic data interchange” or “EDI technology” means the computer-to-computer exchange of business transactions in a standardized structured electronic format. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(a)(3). If a taxpayer uses electronic data interchange processes and technology, then the level of record detail (in combination with other records related to the transactions) must be equivalent to that data contained in an acceptable paper record. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(c)(2)(A). The retained records should contain such information as vendor name, invoice date, product description, quantity purchased, price, amount of tax, indication of tax status, shipping detail, etc. Codes may be used to identify some or all of the data elements, provided that the taxpayer provides a method that allows the Commissioner to interpret the coded information. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(c)(2)(A). The taxpayer may capture the information necessary to satisfy record maintenance requirements at any level within the accounting system and need not retain the original EDI transaction records provided that the audit trail, authenticity, and integrity of the retained records can be established. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(c)(2)(B). Electronic Data Processing Systems Requirements The requirements for an electronic data processing accounting system are similar to that of a manual accounting system, in that an adequately designed accounting system should incorporate methods and records that will satisfy the record-keeping requirements above. Additionally, the Commissioner has access to the taxpayer's EDI processing, accounting, or other systems for the purposes of verifying or evaluating the integrity and reliability of those systems to provide accurate and complete records. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(c)(3). Business Process Information Upon the request of the Commissioner, the taxpayer must provide a description of the business process that created the taxpayer's retained records. This description of the business process must include the relationship between the records and the tax documents prepared by the taxpayer and the measures employed to ensure the integrity of the records. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(c)(4)(A). The description of the business process information provided by the taxpayer to the Commissioner must be capable of demonstrating the functions being performed as they relate to the flow of data through the system, the internal controls used to ensure accurate and reliable processing, and the internal controls used to prevent unauthorized addition, alteration, or deletion of retained records. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-02-12(a)(4)(B). Specific documentation required for proper maintenance of machine-sensible records retained to satisfy the record-keeping requirements include record formats or layouts; field definitions(including the meaning of all codes used to represent information);file descriptions (e.g., data set name); detailed charts of accounts and account descriptions; flowcharts for the system and its programs; source listings of programs including those that provide formulas and account deviations from which the retained files were created; and evidence that the retained records reconcile to the accounting records and to the tax returns. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(c)(4)(C). Special Maintenance Requirements for Electronic Storage of Records Taxpayers should refer to the National Archives and Record Administration's (NARA) standards for guidance on the maintenance and storage of electronic records, such as the labeling of records, the location and security of the storage environment, the creation of back-up copies, and the use of periodic testing to confirm the continued integrity of the records. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(d)(1). The NARA standards may be found at 36 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1234, July 1, 1995 edition. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(d)(1). The taxpayer's computer hardware or software must accommodate the extraction and conversion of retained machine-sensible records. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(d)(2). Access to Machine-Sensible Records The Commissioner may be provided access to machine-sensible records as required in a satisfactory manner through a variety of means that take into account a taxpayer's facts and circumstances through consultation with the taxpayer. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(e). Such access must be provided in one or more of the four following manners: • The taxpayer may arrange to provide the Commissioner with the hardware, software, and personnel resources to access the machine-sensible records. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(e)(1). • The taxpayer may arrange for a third party to provide the hardware, software, and personnel resources necessary to access the machine-sensible records. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(e)(2). • The taxpayer may convert the machine-sensible records to a standard record format specified by the Commissioner, including copies of files, on a magnetic medium that is agreed to by the Commissioner. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(e)(3). • The taxpayer and the Commissioner may agree on other means of access to the machine-sensible records. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(e)(4). Taxpayer Responsibility and Discretionary Authority Together with meeting the requirements of maintaining records, a taxpayer may create files solely for the Commissioner's use. The taxpayer should document the process that created the separate file to show the relationship between that file and the original records. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(f)(1). A taxpayer may contract with a third party to provide custodial or management services of the records, but any such contract must not relieve the taxpayer of its responsibilities to maintain records. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(f)(2). Alternative Storage Media (e.g., Microfiche or Microfilm) For purposes of storage and retention, a taxpayer may convert hard copy documents received or produced in the normal course of business and required to be retained under this section to microfilm, microfiche, or other storage-only imaging systems and may discard the original hard copy documents, provided the other required conditions are met. Documents that may be stored on these media include, but are not limited to, general books of account, journals, voucher registers, general and subsidiary ledgers, and supporting records of details, such as sales invoices, purchase invoices, exemption certificates, and credit memoranda. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(g)(1). “Storage-only imaging system” means a system of computer hardware and software that provides for the storage, retention, and retrieval of documents originally created on paper. It does not include any system, or part of a system, that manipulates or processes any information or data contained on the document in any manner other than to reproduce the document in hard copy or as an optical image. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(a)(6). Microfilm, microfiche, and other storage-only imaging systems must meet the following requirements: Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-02-12(g)(2)(A)- (F). • Documentation establishing the procedures for converting the hard copy documents to microfilm, microfiche, or other storage-only imaging system must be maintained and made available to the Commissioner on request. Such documentation must, at a minimum, contain a sufficient description to allow an original document to be followed through the conversion system as well as internal procedures established for inspection and quality assurance. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(g)(2)(A). • Procedures must be established for the effective identification, processing, storage, and preservation of the stored documents and for making them available for the period they must be retained. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(g)(2)(B). • Upon request by the Commissioner, a taxpayer must provide facilities and equipment for reading, locating, and reproducing any documents maintained on microfilm, microfiche, or other storage-only imaging system. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(g)(2)(C). • When displayed on such equipment or reproduced on paper, the documents must exhibit a high degree of legibility and readability. For this purpose, legibility is defined as the quality of a letter or numeral that enables the observer to identify it positively and quickly to the exclusion of all other letters or numerals. Readability is defined as the quality of a group of letters or numerals being recognizable as words or complete numbers. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(g)(2)(D). • All data stored on microfilm, microfiche, or other storage-only imaging systems must be maintained and arranged in a manner that permits the location of any particular record. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(g)(2)(E). • There is no substantial evidence that the microfilm, microfiche, or other storage-only imaging system lacks authenticity or integrity. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(g)(2)(F). Effect of Other Record-Keeping Systems on Hard Copy Record-Keeping Requirements Except as otherwise provided below, taxpayers are not relieved of the responsibility to retain hard copy records that are created or received in the ordinary course of business, as required by existing law and regulations. Hard copy records may be retained on a record-keeping medium as provided below. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(h)(1). If hard copy records are not produced or received in the ordinary course of transacting business (e.g., when the taxpayer uses electronic data interchange technology), then such hard copy records need not be created. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(h)(2). Hard copy records generated at the time of a transaction using a credit or debit card must be retained unless all the details necessary to determine correct tax liability relating to the transaction are subsequently received and retained by the taxpayer. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(h)(3). Computer printouts that are created for validation, control, or other temporary purposes need not be retained. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(h)(4). The Commissioner is not prevented from requesting hard copy printouts in lieu of retained machine-sensible records at the time of examination. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-2-12(h)(5). BNA-SUTN CT 31.9.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Refunds

Both A taxpayer may file a written claim for a refund within three years from the last day of the month succeeding the period for which the overpayment was made, or, with respect to assessments made under Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-415 and Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-416, within six months after the assessments became final. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-425(1). See Connecticut Policy Statement PS 1998(5). The claim for a refund must state the specific grounds for the refund. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-425(3). “Refund” means any taxpayer's claim to repayment of an overpayment of a tax determined by Connecticut to be owed to the taxpayer by Connecticut. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-39f. BNA-SUTN CT 31.10.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Statute of Limitations Refund Requests

3 Years A taxpayer has three years from the last day of the month succeeding the period for which the overpayment was made to request a refund. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-425(1). However, for financially disabled individuals, Connecticut suspends the tax refund claim statute of limitations if the individual proves his or her financial disability. An individual is “financially disabled” if he or she cannot manage his or her financial affairs by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months. An individual is not financially disabled during any period that his or her spouse or any other person is authorized to act on behalf of him or her in financial matters. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-39f. BNA-SUTN CT 31.11.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Statute of Limitations Assessment of Additional Tax

3 Years Connecticut's statute of limitations for assessing additional tax is three years from the later of the date filed or the last day of the month following the period for which the amount is proposed to be assessed. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-415(f). If the taxpayer commits fraud with intent to evade taxes when the sales and use tax return was filed, then the Department of Revenue Services may impose an assessment beyond the three-year statute of limitations. Leonard v. Connecticut Comr. of Rev. Svcs., 822 A.2d 1184, 264 Conn. 286 (Conn. 2003). BNA-SUTN CT 31.11.2.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Civil Penalties

Yes Connecticut imposes a variety of civil penalties related to sales and use taxes. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-415; Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-416; Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-419. Civil penalties are assessed as follows: • 25 percent on deficiencies due to fraud or intent to evade tax; Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-415(d). • the greater of $50 or 15 percent on deficiencies due to negligence or intentional disregard; Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-415(c). • the greater of $50 or 15 percent of estimated assessments due to a failure to file a return; Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-416. • the greater of $50 or 15 percent of tax owed for failure to pay any tax on time (with the exception of deficiencies); Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-419. and • the greater of $50 or 15 percent of the amount specified in a notice of jeopardy, if not paid on or before the 10th day after service of notice of the assessment. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-417(2); Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-419. If required to pay electronically, the penalty for a late Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) will be assessed as follows: • 2 percent of the required tax due for EFT payments not more than 5 days late; • 5 percent of the required EFT payments more than 5 days late but not more than 15 days late; and • 10 percent of the required EFT payments more than 15 days late. Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2017(15)(Jan. 26, 2018). BNA-SUTN CT 31.12.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Criminal Penalties

Yes In addition to civil penalties, beginning Oct. 1, 2013, any person that delivers or discloses fraudulent or false documents, such as false resale certificates, to the state is guilty of a class D felony. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-428(2), as amended by 2013 Conn. S.B. 983, effective Oct. 1, 2013. BNA-SUTN CT 31.12.2.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Waiver of Penalties

Yes. The Connecticut Commissioner of Revenue Services may waive all or part of all civil penalties when a taxpayer proves that the failure to pay any tax was due to reasonable cause and was not intentional or due to neglect. Conn. Gen. Stat. § 12-735; see Connecticut Policy Statement PS 2018(3) (Nov. 15, 2018). Penalties for negligence found during audit, attempt to evade, or criminal penalties will not be waived. Connecticut Policy Statement PS 2018(3) (Nov. 15, 2018). Filing a Penalty Waiver Request A taxpayer must complete and submit Connecticut Form DRS-PW (Request for Waiver of Civil Penalty) to request a penalty waiver. A taxpayer's failure to provide sufficient supporting documentation will result in a denial of a penalty waiver request. Form DRS-PW must be filed no later than one year from the date that the first notice of the penalty was sent to the taxpayer, or if the penalty is reported on a tax return, no later than one year from the date the return was filed. Connecticut Policy Statement PS 2018(3) (Nov. 15, 2018). Reasonable Cause In Connecticut, the two-pronged requirement has been condensed into a single requirement of reasonable cause. The Commissioner will apply a reasonable cause standard when determining to waive a penalty less than $1,000, or to make a recommendation to the Penalty Review Committee for a penalty greater than $1,000. Connecticut Policy Statement PS 2018(3) (Nov. 15, 2018). Reasonable cause is judged individually, on a case-by-case basis, based on its facts, circumstances, and supporting documentation. Reasonable cause is never presumed, and financial hardship cannot be considered in determining whether to waive a tax penalty. Connecticut Policy Statement PS 2018(3) (Nov. 15, 2018). Examples of Reasonable Cause Examples: The following are situations which Connecticut has indicated will be eligible for the penalty waiver for being either reasonable or unintentional:• There has been a loss of business records necessary to prepare a tax return as a result of fire or other casualty, unless sufficient time to reconstruct the records has elapsed. • the tax return preparer (or a member of the immediate family of the preparer)has died or become seriously ill, however, if more than one person is responsible for preparing tax returns, the failure to pay tax on time will not be due to reasonable cause (Note: it is not clear what the full implication of this is for joint filers); • an unforeseeable unavailability of the tax return preparer arises, however, neither a vacation trip nor a non-emergency business trip will count as an unforeseeable absence; • a mathematical error is made on a tax return resulting in an underpayment of tax, but the taxpayer exercised ordinary business care and prudence to avoid such an error; • figures are transposed on a check or money order resulting in an underpayment of tax, but the taxpayer exercised ordinary business care and prudence to avoid such an error; • the taxpayer contacted a tax advisor and provided all necessary information, but the advisor incorrectly advised the taxpayer that a tax return was not required (or that an actually incorrect amount tax was correctly reported) and the taxpayer must also have used ordinary business prudence in determining not to seek further advice; or • no tax return was filed (or a tax return was filed but the tax was underreported)and the taxpayer did not contact a tax advisor, but the taxpayer made a reasonable effort to comply with tax laws, and the taxpayer exercised ordinary business care in determining not to contact a tax advisor. Conn. Agencies Regs. § 12-3a-1; Connecticut Policy Statement PS 2018(3) (Nov. 15, 2018). BNA-SUTN CT 31.12.3.

Yes In 2009, Connecticut had a Tax Amnesty Program that provided individuals and businesses the opportunity to pay taxes due for any period ending on or before Nov. 30, 2008, to avoid penalties and criminal prosecution, and to take advantage of a reduced interest rate. Connecticut Dept. of Rev. Svcs., Voluntary Disclosure Program. More specifically, the interest rate was reduced from 1 percent to three-quarters of one percent per month from the date the taxes were originally due to the date of payment or June 25, 2009, whichever was earlier. The program ran from May 1, 2009, to June 25, 2009. Connecticut Dept. of Rev. Svcs., Voluntary Disclosure Program. Some taxpayers did not qualify for tax amnesty. A taxpayer who was then under audit for an eligible period could not apply for amnesty for that tax type during the period under audit. Likewise, a taxpayer who was under criminal investigation did not qualify, nor did a taxpayer who was a party to any civil or criminal litigation that was pending on Nov. 25, 2008.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Voluntary Disclosure Relief

Yes The Connecticut Department of Revenue Services offers a voluntary disclosure program through which businesses and individuals not in compliance with Connecticut tax laws may voluntarily bring their accounts into compliance. Conn. Gen. Stat. § 12-2d; Conn. Gen. Stat. § 12-2e; Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2018(18) (Nov. 6, 2018). If a taxpayer has failed to pay Connecticut taxes, or has under-reported income or transactions on which taxes should be paid, the taxpayer may contact the Department of Revenue to make satisfactory arrangements to clear his or her tax record. Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2018(18) (Nov. 6, 2018); Connecticut Dept. of Rev. Svcs., Voluntary Disclosure Program. Benefits to Taxpayers for Participation in Voluntary Disclosure Whether the nonpayment of taxes is because of lack of information about Connecticut tax laws, or deliberate avoidance of payment, taxpayers who voluntarily disclose nonpayment or underpayment of their taxes may generally be offered favorable terms to repay back taxes due. While the taxpayer must pay the total taxes and interest due for a period determined by the Voluntary Disclosure Agreement that it enters into with the Department of Revenue Services, the taxpayer will benefit by not having a penalty imposed, receiving a limited look-back period, and by not having to fear discovery through the state's normal investigative or audit procedures. Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2018(18) (Nov. 6, 2018); Connecticut Dept. of Rev. Svcs., Voluntary Disclosure Program. Another benefit includes confidentiality of information disclosed. The Connecticut Department of Revenue Services will not volunteer any information obtained under the Voluntary Disclosure Program nor discuss the terms and conditions of the voluntary disclosure agreement with any other jurisdiction's taxing authority or the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2018(18) (Nov. 6, 2018); Connecticut Dept. of Rev. Svcs., Voluntary Disclosure Program. Certain Taxpayers Disqualified From Participation A taxpayer may be disqualified and any agreement made with the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services rendered null and void if it is discovered that there was a previous contact of any kind by the Department; a misrepresentation is made by the taxpayer of any facts set forth in the Disclosure Agreement; or the taxpayer fails to comply with the terms of the agreement. Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2018(18) (Nov. 6, 2018); Connecticut Dept. of Rev. Svcs., Voluntary Disclosure Program. Program Application Procedure Taxpayers may make an anonymous inquiry about the Voluntary Disclosure Program by contacting the Department of Revenue Services and no attempt will be made in any way to identify those taxpayers who wish to remain unidentified. However, in order to be considered for participation in the Voluntary Disclosure Program, a formal petition must be made in writing to the Department of Revenue. Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2018(18) (Nov. 6, 2018); Connecticut Dept. of Rev. Svcs., Voluntary Disclosure Program. Qualification for Participation in the Voluntary Disclosure Program In order for a taxpayer to participate in Connecticut's Voluntary Disclosure Program, the taxpayer must file all returns or comparable worksheets for the period or periods agreed upon; pay all tax and interest for the period or periods agreed upon; agree to make books and records available to the Department; and waive all rights to request a refund based on a lack of nexus or contacts with Connecticut. Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2018(18) (Nov. 6, 2018); Connecticut Dept. of Rev. Svcs., Voluntary Disclosure Program. Required Content and Submission of Request The Disclosure Application must be a written request made by the taxpayer and should contain the following information: • the type of tax involved; • a description of the applicant's activities in the state; • the starting date of the applicant's activities in the state; • reasons for the taxpayer's noncompliance with Connecticut's tax laws; • the amount of potential tax liability; and • an admission of liability for the tax type at issue. Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2018(18) (Nov. 6, 2018); Connecticut Dept. of Rev. Svcs., Voluntary Disclosure Program. Additionally, a taxpayer may not use the Voluntary Disclosure Program to circumvent the ruling process or to raise any issues regarding the applicability of a tax to a particular set of facts or circumstances including nexus determinations. Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2010(18);Connecticut Dept. of Rev. Svcs., Voluntary Disclosure Program. Factors Considered for Acceptance into the Voluntary Disclosure Program Each Disclosure Application is considered on its own merits. Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2018(18) (Nov. 6, 2018); Connecticut Dept. of Rev. Svcs., Voluntary Disclosure Program. The Department of Revenue Services considers the following criteria related to the taxpayer's previous presence and activity in Connecticut and compliance with the tax laws of the state: • the nature and magnitude of the presence, activity, and circumstances by which a nexus may have been established; • a demonstration of a taxpayer exercising reasonable care to determine that such activities and presence were or were not immune to taxation; • evidence that taxpayer's noncompliance was not in willful disregard of the tax laws; • demonstration of good faith by the taxpayer; • benefits to the state by entering into a voluntary disclosure agreement with the taxpayer; and • whether the taxpayer has collected any taxes. Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2018(18) (Nov. 6, 2018); Connecticut Dept. of Rev. Svcs., Voluntary Disclosure Program. After review of the written request, the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services will notify the taxpayer or the taxpayer's representative whether the request was accepted, denied, or requires additional information. If accepted, the taxpayer will receive an acceptance letter (agreement) outlining what has been agreed to. Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2018(18) (Nov. 6, 2018); Connecticut Dept. of Rev. Svcs., Voluntary Disclosure Program. CT Fresh Start Voluntary Compliance Program Connecticut has launched a voluntary compliance initiative, CT Fresh Start, that provides benefits to businesses and individuals who agree to report and pay their outstanding, unreported tax liabilities. The department will waive one-half of the interest accrued, will not impose penalties on the tax reported and paid, and will not pursue criminal prosecution related to any applications submitted in good faith. The look-back period is limited to three years and the department will agree not to pursue older, unfiled returns. Taxpayers who have failed to file a return or failed to report the full amount due on a previously filed return are eligible for the program, which applies to returns due on or before Dec. 31, 2016. Taxpayers are ineligible, however, if they have received a bill, are under audit, are party to a closing agreement with the department, have an accepted offer of compromise, have protested an audit determination, or are party to litigation against the department and commissioner. The program began in November 2017 and will run through Nov. 30, 2018. 2017 Conn. S.B. 1502, effective Nov. 3, 2017 (uncodified). See Connecticut Press Release: Gov.

Participates Connecticut participates in the Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program (MVDP). Multistate Tax Commission, Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program. The MVDP allows taxpayers with outstanding tax liabilities in multiple states to negotiate settlements via a process coordinated by the National Nexus Program (NNP) staff of the MTC. Multistate Tax Commission, Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program. To participate in the MVDP, the taxpayer must:• have a minimum good-faith tax liability estimate of $500 or more; • not have been contacted by a state or commission regarding taxes due;and • submit a completed Voluntary Disclosure Agreement (VDA) including taxpayer's contact information, tax year, list of states to receive the proposed VDA, description of taxpayer's activities in each state, and estimate of taxes due. Multistate Tax Commission, Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program. Connecticut may have additional requirements for participation in the MVDP. The program is intended to incentivize taxpayers to begin filing and paying taxes in all of the states in which they have substantial nexus. Upon entering into a voluntary disclosure agreement with a state, taxpayers will be required to file returns, pay the tax due and accrued interest on the returns, and register with the state in exchange for waiver of penalties for the entire look-back period. Taxpayers are not charged to participate in the MVDP. Online Marketplace Seller Voluntary Disclosure Initiative—Special Multistate Tax Commission (MTC)Program From Aug. 17, 2017, through Nov. 1, 2017, Connecticut is participating in the MTC's special limited-time voluntary disclosure initiative in which back sales and use tax liability may be waived for eligible online marketplace sellers that timely register and begin to collect the state's sales and use tax.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Audits

Authorized Authorization to Examine Records The Commissioner or any person the Commissioner authorizes may examine the books, papers, records, and equipment of any person selling services or tangible personal property and any person liable for the use tax, and may investigate the character of the business of the person to verify the accuracy of any return made or, if no return is made by the person, to ascertain and determine the amount required to be paid. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-426(4). The Commissioner may employ accountants, auditors, investigators, assistants, and clerks necessary for the efficient administration of the state's tax, and may designate representatives to conduct hearings or perform any other duties imposed upon the Commissioner. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-426(2). Reports Related to Use Tax Liability In administration of the use tax the Commissioner may require the filing of information reports by any person or class of persons having in his or their possession or custody information relating to sales of services or tangible personal property the storage, acceptance, consumption, or other use of which is subject to the tax. These informational reports must be filed when the Commissioner requires and must set forth the names and addresses of purchasers of the services or tangible personal property, the sales price of the services or property, the date of sale, and such other information as the Commissioner may require. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-426(5). Audit Examination Policy for Retail Transactions The Connecticut Department of Revenue Services issued a Policy Statement that establishes that Connecticut will take action to follow a policy aimed to minimize the potential multiple taxation of retail sales where audit examinations of a retailer and of a retail customer disclose that proper taxes were not paid with respect to a particular taxable sale made by the retailer to its retail customer. Connecticut Policy Statement PS 1993(4). Audit Policy Applied to Examination of Retailers In conducting an audit examination of a retailer for sales and use taxes in Connecticut, the Department will, on its own initiative, consider separately those taxable retail sales that were made by that retailer to every retail customer who is a perpetually audited taxpayer. Connecticut Policy Statement PS 1993(4). A “perpetually audited taxpayer”is a retail customer whose tax returns for all taxable periods are always subjected to audit examination and who is designated as a perpetually audited taxpayer by the Department. The Department will notify in writing those taxpayers whom it will treat, for purposes of a Policy Statement, as perpetually audited taxpayers. Connecticut Policy Statement PS 1993(4). A person who is designated as a perpetually audited taxpayer must not willfully induce or attempt to induce a retailer not to collect taxes on taxable retail sales made by the retailer to that person. If the Department determines that a retailer made taxable retail sales to a perpetually audited taxpayer and failed to collect tax on those sales, the Department will make an audit assessment in connection with those sales against the perpetually audited taxpayer, and not against the retailer. Additionally, if the audit examination of the retailer is conducted by sampling, the Department will not consider the sales as errors in reporting taxable retail sales. The Department will maintain confidentiality and not disclose the identity of perpetually audited taxpayers. Connecticut Policy Statement PS 1993(4); Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-15(c). “Sampling” means conducting an audit examination using one or more taxable periods as a test period, with errors in reporting taxable retail sales or purchases during such period to be extrapolated to the entire audit examination period. Sampling is to be contrasted with an audit examination involving a detailed examination of the books and records of the taxpayer and not involving the use of a test period. Connecticut Policy Statement PS 1993(4). Where the retailer establishes that, with respect to the taxable periods in its audit examination period, one of its retail customers who the Department determines is not a perpetually audited taxpayer and has already been subjected to audit examination for sales and use taxes by the Department for some or all of the same taxable periods as the retailer, the Department will also consider separately those taxable retail sales that were made to that retail customer as follows: Connecticut Policy Statement PS 1993(4). • If the audit examination period of the retailer is the same as the audit examination period of the retail customer, the Department will not make an audit assessment against the retailer in connection with the sales to that retail customer. Connecticut Policy Statement PS 1993(4). • If the audit examination period of the retailer overlaps but is not the same as the audit examination period of the retail customer, and a detailed examination of the retailer's books and records is made, the Department will not make an audit assessment against the retailer in connection with the sales to that customer during the overlapping taxable periods. Connecticut Policy Statement PS 1993(4). • If the audit examination period of the retailer overlaps but is not the same as the audit examination period of the retail customer, the Department conducts the audit examination of the retailer by sampling, and the taxable period or periods that are chosen as the test period were taxable periods within the audit examination period of the customer, the Department will not make an audit assessment against the retailer in connection with the sales to that customer, and for sampling purposes, will not consider the sales as errors in reporting taxable retail sales. Connecticut Policy Statement PS 1993(4). • However, if the audit examination period of the retailer overlaps but is not the same as the audit examination period of the retail customer, the Department conducts the audit examination of the retailer by sampling, and the taxable period or periods that are chosen as the test period were not taxable periods within the audit examination period of the customer, the Department will make an audit assessment against the retailer in connection with taxable retail sales made by the retailer to the retail customer during the audit examination period of the retailer, and for sampling purposes, will consider the sales as errors in reporting taxable retail sales. Connecticut Policy Statement PS 1993(4). The retailer may establish that, with respect to the taxable periods in its audit examination period, one of its retail customers has been subjected to audit examination for sales and use taxes by the Department for some or all of the same taxable periods as the retailer by obtaining from the retail customer an audit verification letter that has been issued by the Department to the retail customer. Connecticut Policy Statement PS 1993(4). If the retail customer has gone out of business and the retail customer's records, including the audit verification letter, are not available or if the retail customer will not provide a copy of the audit verification letter, the retailer may still be able to establish that taxes were subsequently paid either to the retailer or directly to the Department on taxable retail sales made by the retailer to the customer. Connecticut Policy Statement PS 1993(4). Audit Policy for Examination of Perpetually Audited Retail Customers In conducting an audit examination of a retail customer who is a perpetually audited taxpayer for sales and use taxes, the Department will make an audit assessment against that retail customer in connection with taxable retail sales that were made to that customer but on which tax was not collected by the retailer, even though the retailer or retailers making those sales to the retail customer may already have been subjected to audit examination. This is because, in conducting the audit examination of a retailer who made taxable retail sales to a perpetually audited taxpayer, the Department does not choose to make an audit assessment against the retailer in connection with taxable retail sales that were made to such a customer. Connecticut Policy Statement PS 1993(4). Audit Policy for Examination of Retail Customers Not Perpetually Audited In conducting an audit examination of a retail customer who is not a perpetually audited taxpayer for sales and use taxes, where a customer establishes that, with respect to the taxable periods in its audit examination period, a retailer that made taxable retail sales to the customer has already been subjected to audit examination for sales and use taxes by the Department for some or all of the same taxable periods as the customer, the Department will consider separately those taxable retail sales that were made to the customer by that retailer as follows: Connecticut Policy Statement PS 1993(4). If the audit examination period of the retail customer is the same as the audit examination period of the retailer, the Department will not make an audit assessment against the customer in connection with the sales made by the retailer to the customer. Connecticut Policy Statement PS 1993(4). If the audit examination period of the retail customer overlaps but is not the same as the audit examination period of the retailer, and a detailed examination of the customer's books and records is made, the Department will not make an audit assessment against the customer in connection with the sales made by the retailer to the customer during the overlapping taxable periods. Connecticut Policy Statement PS 1993(4). If the audit examination period of the retail customer overlaps but is not the same as the audit examination period of the retailer, the Department conducts the audit examination of the retail customer by sampling, and the taxable period or periods that are chosen as the test period were taxable periods within the audit examination period of the retailer, the Department will not make an audit assessment against the retail customer in connection with the sales by the retailer to the customer, and for sampling purposes, will not consider those transactions as errors in reporting taxable retail purchases by the customer. Connecticut Policy Statement PS 1993(4). The Department will not refrain from making an audit assessment against any customer who induced the retailer, through the issuance of any certificate or other statement to the retailer not to collect tax on those sales, or who made a taxable use of items sold by the retailer to the customer subsequent to the sale. This could occur, for example, by presenting a purchase order indicating that tax should not be collected on the sale. Connecticut Policy Statement PS 1993(4). If the audit examination period of the retail customer overlaps but is not the same as the audit examination period of the retailer, the Department conducts an audit examination of the customer by sampling, and the taxable period or periods that are chosen as the test period for the customer were not taxable periods within the audit examination period of the retailer, the Department will make an audit assessment against the customer in connection with taxable retail sales made by the retailer to the customer during the audit examination period of the customer, and for sampling purposes, will consider those transactions as errors in reporting taxable retail purchases by the customer. Connecticut Policy Statement PS 1993(4). The retail customer may establish that, with respect to the taxable periods in its audit examination period, a retailer by whom taxable sales were made to the customer has already been subjected to audit examination for sales and use taxes by the Department for some or all of the same taxable periods as the retail customer by obtaining from the retailer an audit verification letter that has been issued by the Department to the retailer. However, if the retailer has gone out of business and the retailer's records, including the audit verification letter, are not available or if the retailer will not provide a copy of the audit verification letter, the customer may still be able to establish that taxes were subsequently paid either to the retailer or directly to the Department on taxable retail sales that were made to the customer by the retailer but on which the retailer did not collect tax. Connecticut Policy Statement PS 1993(4). Effect of Audit Examination Currently Conducted on a Retailer and a Retail Customer Where a retailer or one of its retail customers can establish that the Department is currently conducting audit examinations of both the retailer and the retail customer, and the audit examination periods overlap, the Department will not make an audit assessment against the retailer in connection with taxable retail sales that were made to the customer by the retailer and on which the retailer failed to collect taxes. Instead, the Department will make an audit assessment against the retail customer. Connecticut Policy Statement PS 1993(4). BNA-SUTN CT 31.16.
