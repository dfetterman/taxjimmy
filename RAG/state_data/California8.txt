Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Prepared Food General Rule

Taxable California imposes sales and use tax on prepared food. See Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6359(d); California Tax Publication 22; California Tax Publication 452. California's food exemption does not extend to:• food products served as meals on or off premises of the retailer; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6359(d)(1). • food products furnished, prepared, or served for consumption at tables, chairs or counters or from trays, dishes and other tableware, whether provided by the retailer or retailer's contractor; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6359(d)(2). • food sold for immediate consumption, including take out; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6359(d)(3). • food products sold for consumption within a place charging admission; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6359(d)(4). • food products sold through a vending machine; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6359(d)(5); California Tax Publication 118. or • food products sold as hot prepared food products. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6359(d)(7). But see California SBOE Business Taxes Memorandum Opinion CenturyTheatres (Nov. 4, 2004) (movie theater popcorn exempt because not intended to be sold and served hot). Additionally, the exemption does not generally extend to food products furnished in a form suitable for consumption on the seller's premises if: (1) over 80 percent of the seller's gross receipts are from the sale of food products; and(2) over 80 percent of the seller's retail sales of food products are sales subject to tax as:• food products served as meals on or off the premises of the retailer; • food products furnished, prepared, or served for consumption at tables, chairs, or counters or from trays, glasses, dishes, or other tableware whether provided by the retailer or by a person with whom the retailer contracts to furnish, prepare, or serve food products to others; • food products ordinarily sold for immediate consumption on or near a location at which parking facilities are provided primarily for the use of patrons in consuming the products purchased at the location, even though those products are sold on a “take out” or “to go” order and are actually packaged or wrapped and taken from the premises of the retailer; or • food products sold as hot prepared food products. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6359(d)(6); see also California Tax Publication 22. Notwithstanding this 80-percent rule, beginning April 1, 1996, a seller may still sell otherwise exempt food products exempt from tax if the seller elects to separately account for these exempt sales. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6359(f). The seller must maintain records in such a manner as to fully document the sale of exempt food. Failure to do so results in the seller's exemption being revoked and all of the seller's sales of food products furnished in a form suitable for consumption on the seller's premises being subject to tax. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6359(f). Many liquor stores have microwave ovens that are used to heat food products, such as burritos, individual-size pizzas, soups, and sandwiches. If a liquor store is selling a food product that is normally tax exempt, such as a frozen burrito, the product may become taxable if it is heated in a microwave oven prior to the sale. The location of the microwave oven generally determines whether the sale is subject to tax. California Tax Publication 24. If the oven is located in a place that is accessible to customers, the sale of the heated food product is not taxable. It is presumed that the food is not sold in a heated condition and that customers, rather than employees, will use the microwave oven to heat the food. If the microwave oven is accessible only to store employees, the sale is taxable. It is presumed that employees, rather than customers, will heat the food prior to the sale. California Tax Publication 24. BNA-SUTN CA 11.2.1.

The average daily rate of a lodging establishment's rooms is calculated by dividing the establishment's “gross room revenue” for the preceding calendar year by the number of rooms rented for that year. “Gross room revenue” includes the full charge to hotel guests for the previous year, excluding separately stated occupancy taxes, revenue from contract and group rentals that do not qualify for complimentary food and beverages, and revenue from special packages (e.g., New Year's Eve packages) that include food and beverages as well as guest room accommodations, unless it can be documented that the retail value of the food and beverages provided as a part of the special package constitutes 10 percent or less of the total package charge. The number of rooms rented during the previous calendar year is calculated by adding the total number of times that all rooms were rented on a nightly basis, exclusive of room rentals the revenue of which is excluded from the “gross room revenue.” Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1603(a)(1)(E). The retail value of complimentary food and beverages provided is calculated by marking up the cost of the food and beverages provided by the lodging establishment by 100 percent. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1603(a)(2)(B). The cost of the food and beverages to a lodging establishment includes amounts paid by the establishment to vendors of the food and beverages, but does not include the cost of food preparation by hotel employees or the fair rental value of hotel facilities used to prepare or serve meals. California SBOE Business Taxes Memorandum Opinion EmbassySuites (Oct. 10, 1996). If the lodging establishment provides food or drink coupons to guests, then the establishment is either a consumer or a retailer for tax purposes, depending on whether the coupon is transferable and whether the guest is identified by name on the coupon. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1603(a)(2)(B). American Plan hotels (i.e., hotels that charge guests a fixed sum by the day, week or other period for room and meals combined) and hotels that offer special packages (e.g., a New Year's Eve package) must segregate charges for rooms and the charges for meals and beverages. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1603(a)(2)(A). BNA-SUTN CA 11.6.

Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Mobile Food Vendors

Depends Effective July 1, 2014, taxable sales by mobile food vendors (e.g., food truck operators) are presumed to include tax unless a separately stated sales tax amount is added to the price charged. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1603(v); California SBOE Special Notice L-383 (June 1, 2014). Mobile food vendors include operators of food trucks, stands, or carts that do not have a fixed location. Mobile food vendors must pay sales or use taxes at the rate for the location in which the sale is made. Such vendors must register for a seller's permit, file sales and use tax returns, and maintain adequate books and records, and generally, are subject to the same tax reporting requirements as brick-and-mortar restaurants. California Publication 388—Sept. 2018; California Tax Publication 388—Sept. 2016 (discussing mobile food vendors); California Tax Publication 287. This presumption does not apply when mobile food vendors act as caterers by serving food on a customer's premises. Before July 1, 2014, mobile food vendors' sales were considered to include tax only if the vendor posted signs stating that tax was included in the listed menu prices. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1603(v); California SBOE Special Notice L-383 (June 1, 2014). If mobile food vendors sell hot, prepared food or carbonated beverages, such as sodas, the vendors must report tax on those sales. In addition, all food sold for consumption at tables that the vendors provide is considered taxable. One exception to hot prepared food is the sale of hot bakery goods (donuts, muffins, etc.)which are not taxable. Sales of hot coffee and tea are also not taxable as long as they are purchased “to-go.” Sales of cold food products purchased “to-go” generally are not taxable. Cold food products include cold sandwiches, milkshakes, smoothies, ice cream, and cold salads, among others. California Tax Publication 287. BNA-SUTN CA 11.7.

Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Restaurant Equipment

Taxable California does not provide any sales and use tax exemptions for restaurant equipment and it is therefore subject to sales and use tax as tangible personal property. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6051. BNA-SUTN CA 11.8.

Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Vending Machines

Depends Sales tax on vending machine sales varies depending on the type of item being sold. See California Tax Publication 118. Food Sales Subject to Partial Tax Sales tax applies to 33 percent of a vending machine operator's gross receipts for food products that would be exempt if sold from a store. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6359.2(d); California Tax Publication 118. Food products subject to partial tax include cold food products, hot coffee, hot tea, and hot chocolate when those products are sold for a separate price through a vending machine. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6018.3(e); California Tax Publication 118. Food Sales Subject to Full Tax Vending machines sales of all carbonated beverages and hot food products (other than hot beverages) are fully taxable, just as they would be in a store or at a restaurant. California Tax Publication 118. Vending Machine Operators as Consumers The vending machine operator is considered a consumer, and not a retailer, when he or she purchases any food product, other than hot beverages and hot prepared food products, to sell through a vending machine for $0.15 or less. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6359.4(a). A vending machine operator is also a consumer, and not a retailer, of food products sold through a coin-operated bulk vending machine if the amount of each sale is $0.25 or less. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6359.4(b). A “bulk vending machine” means a vending machine containing unsorted food products, other than beverages or hot prepared food products which, upon insertion of a coin, dispenses those food products, including candy and confectionery, in approximately equal portions, at random, and without selection by the customer. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6359.4(b). As a consumer, the vending machine operator generally must pay tax on her purchase of items sold through the vending machine. However, if the property sold to the operator is an exempt food product or a nonreturnable container, no tax is payable regardless of the nature of the product when dispensed through the vending machine, and regardless of whether facilities for consumption are furnished at locations of the vending machines. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1574(b)(2). Record Keeping The vending machine operator must keep detailed and particular records showing the location or locations of each machine, the serial number, and other relevant information. See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1574; California Tax Publication 118. BNA-SUTN CA 11.9.

Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Other Food-Related Transactions

Depends Combination Packages Retailers selling combination packages containing nontaxable food items in addition to taxable non-food items generally must determine the taxable portion of the package allocable to non-food items. California Tax Publication 31—Oct. 2016. If the retailer does not maintain records necessary to segregate the taxable and nontaxable portions of such packages and the retail value of the package's taxable contents exceeds 10 percent of the value of all package contents, the entire retail sales price of the package will be subject to tax. However, the entire package will be nontaxable if:• the retail value of the non-food items is 10 percent or less of the total value of the package's contents (excluding the value of the package container itself); and • the package container's retail value is 50 percent or less of the entire combination package value. California Tax Publication 31—Oct. 2016. Online Restaurant Ordering Services If a restaurant contracts with an online food ordering service provider (e.g., Postmates, Seamless)that takes order from customers for meals provided by the restaurant, the restaurant is liable for tax on those meals when an agency relationship exists. If the online ordering service provider acts as an agent for the restaurant, the restaurant is considered the retailer of the meals through the online ordering service. Tax is due on the full selling price of the meals and no deduction is allowed for the commission retained by the service provider. If an agency relationship does not exist, the online ordering service provider is considered the retailer of the meals. In this case, the service provider is required to register for a seller's permit and is liable for the tax on the meals. Restaurants must obtain a valid resale certificate from the service provider, or tax is due on the transaction between the restaurant and the service provider, as well as the transaction between the service provider and the customer. California Tax Publication 22. BNA-SUTN CA 11.10.
