Yes Kentucky imposes a privilege tax on retailers who have sufficient nexus with the state of Kentucky at a rate of 6 percent of the gross receipts derived from the retail sales of tangible personal property, digital property, and upon the provision of certain services. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §139.200. Although the tax is imposed on the retailer's gross receipts, the retailer is required to collect the tax from the purchaser and the tax must be separately stated on the sales receipt. The taxes collected by the retailer are considered to be held in trust by the retailer for the Commonwealth and are considered a debt of the retailer to the Commonwealth. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §139.210. BNA-SUTN KY 1.1.1.

Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Local Option Sales and Use Tax

Local Tax Authorized The Kentucky state constitution provides that the General Assembly may authorize cities or towns of any class to provide for taxation for municipal purposes on personal property. Ky. Const. §181. Although the Kentucky legislature has passed legislation authorizing Kentucky municipalities to impose local sales and use tax, no city or municipality has imposed a local sales or use tax. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §91.265; Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §92.281. Kentucky law also authorizes cities and counties that establish or are members of a transit authority to submit to their electorate a proposal to create a mass transit program funded by a sales tax. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §96A.320. Prior Kentucky law offered guidelines for taxation authorization based on a system of classification by population size:• First Class Cities: population of 100,000 or more; • Second Class Cities: population of 20,000 - 99,999; • Third Class Cities: population of 8,000 - 19,999; • Fourth Class Cities: population of 3,000 - 7,900; • Fifth Class Cities: population of 1,000 - 2,999; and • Sixth Class Cities: population of 999 or less. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §81.010 as repealed by 2014 Ky. H.B. 331 §314, effective Jan. 1, 2015; Ky. Const. §156a. See also the Kentucky League of Cities. Effective January 1, 2015, cities are no longer subject to the classification system by population size. Rather, Kentucky cities are now organized into two classes based on the form of their respective government. The two classes are:• First Class Cities: cities organized and operating under the mayor-alderman plan of government pursuant to Chapter 83 of the Kentucky Revenue Statutes; and • Home Rule Class Cities: any city government organized and operating under either of the following classes of government: o city manager plan of government pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §83A.150; o mayor-council plan of government pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §83A.130; and o commission plan of government pursuant to Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §83A.140. See 2014 Ky. H.B. 331 §1, effective Jan. 1, 2015. See also the Kentucky League of Cities. 2014 Ky. H.B. 331 provides guidance on how cities can convert from the prior six-part classification system to the new two-part classification system. See 2014 Ky. H.B. 331, effective Jan. 1, 2015.

Defined Kentucky defines “retail sale” as any sale, lease, or rental for any purpose other than resale, sublease, or subrent. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §139.010(38).

Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §139.010(38). Kentucky provides that the term “sale” includes:• the producing, fabrication, processing, printing, or imprinting of tangible personal property or digital property for a consideration for purchasers who furnish, either directly or indirectly, the materials used in the producing, fabricating, processing, printing, or imprinting; Ky. Rev. Stat.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Use' or 'Storage, Use, or Consumption'

Defined Kentucky defines “use” to include the exercise of any right or power over tangible personal property or digital property incident to the ownership of that property, any transaction in which possession is given, and any transaction involving digital property where the right of access is granted. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §139.010(44)(a). “Use” does not include the keeping, retaining, or exercising of any right or power over tangible personal property or digital property for the purpose of:• selling tangible personal property or digital property in the regular course of business; Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §139.010(44)(b)(1). or • subsequently transporting tangible personal property outside the state for use thereafter solely outside the state, or for the purpose of being processed, fabricated, or manufactured into, attached to, or incorporated into, other tangible personal property to be transported outside the state and thereafter used solely outside the state. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §139.010(44)(b)(2). Morton Buildings v. Revenue Cabinet The Kentucky Court of Appeals has held that use tax applies to materials purchased and processed into building components outside the state and used to construct buildings within Kentucky. In Morton Buildings Inc. v. Revenue Cabinet, the taxpayer, an Illinois company, sold and erected pre-fabricated buildings for industry and farm use in Kentucky and in other states. The taxpayer purchased raw materials outside of the state and made them into building components at factories located outside the state. When a customer ordered a building, the taxpayer withdrew the necessary raw materials from storage and made them into building components. These materials included lumber, nails, cement, staples, insulation and plastic sheeting. The taxpayer sought a refund on all of the use taxes it paid to Kentucky for the cost of the raw materials it used at its factories outside the state to make building components used in Kentucky. The taxpayer argued that the raw materials at issue were not “used, stored or consumed” in Kentucky because the building components made out of the raw materials were new and different items of tangible personal property. Morton Buildings Inc. v. Revenue Cabinet, No. 2002-CA-001787-MR (Ky. Ct. App. July 25, 2003). In its analysis, the Kentucky Court of Appeals applied the following test to determine if the imposition of use tax on the raw materials at issue was proper: • whether the item of tangible personal property is used, stored or consumed in Kentucky; • whether the item of personal property is purchased (not manufactured by the user);and • whether the purchase of the item is for use, storage, or consumption in Kentucky. The Kentucky Court of Appeals held that the manufacturing process that was performed upon the raw materials did not transform the raw materials into something that was not used in Kentucky. As a result, the raw materials were still tangible personal property used in Kentucky as part of the taxpayer's pre-fabricated buildings. Therefore, the raw materials, in their altered form as building materials, are used in Kentucky when made into prefabricated buildings. The court ultimately held that the taxpayer clearly exercised a right or power over raw material when it constructs the prefabricated buildings and as such, has a taxable use of the materials in Kentucky. Morton Buildings Inc. v. Revenue Cabinet, No. 2002-CA-001787-MR (Ky. Ct. App. July 25, 2003). BNA-SUTN KY 1.4.3.

Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §139.010(35)(b). However, any person making sales at a charitable auction for a qualifying entity is not a retailer for purposes of the sales made at the charitable auction. However, the qualifying entity sponsoring the auction is the retailer for purposes of the sales made, if the qualifying entity, not the person making sales at the auction, is sponsoring the auction; the purchaser of tangible personal property at the auction directly pays the qualifying entity sponsoring the auction for the property and not the person making the sales at the auction; and the qualifying entity, not the person making sales at the auction, is responsible for the collection, control, and disbursement of the auction proceeds.
