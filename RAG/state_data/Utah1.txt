Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Credit for Tax Paid to Another Jurisdiction

Yes Utah provides an exemption from sales and use tax for a product upon which sales or use tax was paid to some other state or to one of its subdivisions. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-104(26). However, any difference between the tax already paid and Utah's state and local sales and use tax must be paid to Utah. Additionally, no adjustment is allowed if the tax already paid was greater than the amount of state and local sales and use tax that Utah would impose. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-104(26). When a lease originates outside the state, Utah will allow a sales tax credit, up to the Utah rate, for tax properly paid to the other state on the lease payments. Utah Private Letter Ruling No. 96-171 (Nov. 27, 1996). Utah does not allow a credit for tax paid to another state or local jurisdiction under the following circumstances:• on a lease or rental transaction based on the sum of the lease payments (”accelerated basis”), against the sales or use taxes due on the balance of the payments; • on a lease or rental transaction based on deferred collection or remittance method against the sales or use taxes due on the balance of the payments;or • on the acquisition of the product, against the sales or use taxes due on the balance of the lease or rental payments when the tax reimbursement is documented and disclosed to the lessee.
