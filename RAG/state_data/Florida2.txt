Topic: Administration and Procedure Agencies Responsible for Administration Local Sales and Use Tax

Florida Department of Revenue The Florida Department of Revenue is responsible for administering, collecting, and enforcing the county discretionary surtaxes pursuant to the procedures for collecting the state sales and use tax. Fla. Stat. §212.054(4)(a); see Fla. Stat. §212.07 (application of the state tax). A dealer pays the discretionary county surtax along with state sales and use tax on the “Sales and Use Tax Return” form DR-15 or DR-15EZ. The returns and payments are due on the 1st and are considered late after the 20th of the month after the date of the sale, no matter when the customer makes a payment. Florida Tax Brochure GT-800019. Returns and payments postmarked after the 20th are late, unless the 20th falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal or state holiday. In such a case, a return will be considered timely if postmarked on the first business day after the 20th. Florida Tax Brochure GT-800019. The forms are available at www.myflorida.com. Permits, certificates, and affidavits required for the state sales and use tax will satisfy the requirements of the county surtax. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-15.005(1). In computing an estimated tax, the county surtax may not be used. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-15.006(1) The department will then remit the tax back to county where the dealer is located less the cost of administration. Fla. Stat. §212.054(4)(b). The statute of limitations for collecting the tax is three years after the date the tax is due, any return with respect to the tax is due, or such return is filed, whichever occurs later. Fla. Stat. §95.091(3)(a)(1)(b). However, the tax may be assessed at any time if the taxpayer failed to make a required payment of the tax, failed to file a required return, or filed a fraudulent return, unless the taxpayer disclosed in writing the tax liability to the department before the department contacts the taxpayer, then the three year limitation applies. Fla. Stat. §95.091(3)(a)(5). Also, if a refund of a tax has erroneously been made, for any reason, the tax may be assessed within 3 years of such refund, unless such refund was induced by fraud or misrepresentation of material fact, then the assessment may be made at any time. Fla. Stat. §95.091(3)(a)(6)(b). The state of Florida allows taxpayers to engage in a voluntary disclosure program for unpaid sales and use taxes owed to the state. Taxpayers who want to voluntarily disclose surtaxes owed may also utilize this program. Through the program, a taxpayer may report previously unpaid or underpaid tax liabilities for any tax administered by the Florida Department of Revenue. The program allows taxpayers to voluntarily pay these taxes without being penalized. Any taxpayer that has a tax liability administered by the Florida Department of Revenue and who has not been previously contacted by the department concerning the liability is eligible for the program. However, disclosures of delinquencies that would be obvious and routinely assessed by the department are not eligible for the program. Upon disclosure, the department will look back three years from the date of postmark of the voluntary disclosure. To apply for the program, a written request including the following must be submitted:• a statement that the tax payer has not been previously contacted by the department about the tax liability; • the tax type and period being disclosed; • in the case of sales and use tax the city, county, and state of the taxpayer; • in the case of sales and use tax, the type of taxable activities or transactions • sales and use tax certificate number; • a completed Application to Collect and/or Report Tax in Florida (Form DR-1), if the taxpayer needs to register for sales and use tax. If the taxpayer is applying for voluntary disclosure, do not register for sales and use tax online; and • any other facts regarding the disclosure. Fla. Stat. §213.21(7); Florida Tax Brochure GT-800053. BNA-SUTN FL 31.1.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Direct Pay Permits

Authorized Florida offers direct pay permits for taxpayers that fall into one of four self-accrual categories. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.0911(2)(b). The eligible self-accrual categories are:• apportionment—including apportionment of tax by eligible air carriers and the partial exemptions available to certain vehicles and vessels in interstate commerce; • tangible personal property—for dealers who annually purchase in excess of $10 million of taxable tangible personal property in any county for the dealer's own use or who purchase at least $100,000 of taxable tangible personal property when the taxable status of such property will be known only upon its use; • purchases of promotional materials—by dealers who are unable to determine at the time of purchase whether the promotional materials will be used in this state or exported from this state, when the seller of promoted subscriptions to publications sold in this state is a registered dealer and is remitting sales tax to the department on publications sold in this state; and • real property leases—including operators of amusement or vending machines. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.0911(2)(b). Florida statutes specifically provide for self-accrual of the sales tax under one or more of the following circumstances:• where authorized by law for holders of direct pay permits; Fla. Stat. §212.183(1). • where tangible personal property is subject to tax on a prorated basis, and the proration factor is based upon characteristics of the purchaser; Fla.

Bad debt refunds must be filed within 12 months after tax paid on the bad debt has been charged off for federal income tax purposes, and refunds based on repossessed merchandise must be made with 12 months following the month in which the merchandise was repossessed. Fla. Stat. §212.17(3); Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.012(2)(a); Form DR-26SN, Instructions - Application for Refund Sales and Use Tax.

Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.014(3). A taxpayer who has overpaid tax to a dealer, paid tax to a dealer when no tax is due, or paid tax in error to a business must generally secure a refund of the tax from the dealer and not from the Florida Department of Revenue. However, if the dealer declines to give the customer a refund, the dealer may issue an assignment of rights to the customer so that the customer may apply to the department for a refund. Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12A-1.014(4); Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12-26.008(8), amended effective July 8, 2019; see Florida Form DR-26A: Assignment of Rights to Refund of Tax.

A taxpayer paid no penalty and three-quarters of the interest due if it responded to a Department of Revenue bill, delinquency, audit, or other assessment. A taxpayer received tax amnesty only by submitting a Tax Amnesty Agreement by Sept. 30, 2010. This agreement could be filed online through the Department of Revenue's website.
