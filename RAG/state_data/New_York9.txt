Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

Incidental to Service The “incidental”transfer of tangible personal property in connection with rendering a nontaxable service does not result in a taxable transaction. New York TSB-A-05(17)S (May 26, 2005). Thus, an architect's transfer of renderings with design services is considered incidental to the architectural service and is not subject to sales tax. New York TSB-A-00(33)S (Sept. 7, 2000). In addition, with respect to local tax, courts in New York have also ruled that the “incidental”transfer of tangible personal property in connection with rendering a nontaxable service does not result in a taxable transaction. See, e.g., In re Resnick Media Assocs., Inc., New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 803879 (June 16, 1988); In re Bus. Statistics Org., Inc. v. Joseph, 87 N.E.2d 505 (N.Y. 1949); Dun &Bradstreet, Inc. v. New York City, 276 N.Y. 198 (N.Y. 1937). If a transaction includes both a taxable and nontaxable component and the taxable component is not incidental to the provision of service, the seller must collect tax on the entire selling price for both components, if the items are not separately stated. New York TSB-A-98(33)S (May 20, 1998); see also In re AMO USA, Inc., New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 824550 (June 19, 2014) (medical device company did not sell its patent rights to an excimer laser system when it sold the underlying laser system because the company could license the patents separately as nontaxable intangible personal property). But see New York TSB-A-11(32)S (Dec. 7, 2011) (patented medical surgery procedure was likely incorporated into a laser system's hardware design because a doctor apparently could use the hardware only to perform the procedure). BNA-SUTN NY 9.3.1.

Entire Transaction Taxable If a seller sells taxable and exempt items as a single unit, then the seller must collect tax on the entire sales price. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.1(b). Special Rules for Telecommunication Services The Internet Tax Non-Discrimination Act allows the taxation of otherwise exempt internet access service charges that are aggregated with (i.e., bundled) and not separately stated from charges for telecommunications or other taxable services, unless the internet access provider can reasonably identify the charges for internet access from its books and records kept in the regular course of business. N.Y. Tax Law §1111(l)(2); In re Helio, LLC, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 825010 (July 2, 2015), aff'g New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 825010 (June 12, 2014); New York TSB-M-08(4)C (Aug. 1, 2008); New York TSB-M-08(2)S (July 30, 2002). Mobile telecommunications services not otherwise taxable in a state or locality may, however, be subject to tax if the services are bundled with, and not separately stated from, charges that are taxable, unless the provider can identify the nontaxable services from its books and records. N.Y. Tax Law §1111(l)(2); In re Helio, LLC, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 825010 (July 2, 2015), aff'g New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 825010 (June 12, 2014); New York TSB-M-02(4)C (July 30, 2002); New York TSB-M-02(6)S (July 30, 2002).

Any of these taxes that are enacted must include the same corresponding provisions of the state sales and compensating use tax. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(iv)(b)(2), as amended by 2019 N.Y. A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019. Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Mobility Tax (“MCTMT”) The state imposes a sales and compensating use tax in the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District (“MCTD”). N.Y. Tax Law §1109(a); see also New York Publication 420 (describing the MCTMT generally). The tax applies in the same manner as the state sales and use taxes imposed under N.Y. Tax Law §§1105 and 1115. N.Y. Tax Law §1109(a). The MCTD consists of the counties of Dutchess, Nassau, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Suffolk, Westchester, and New York City. N.Y. Pub. Auth. Law §1262; see New York TSB-M-12(1)MCTMT;N.Y. Dept. of Taxn. & Fin., Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Mobility Tax. For tax years beginning on or after Jan. 1, 2012, individual taxpayers are not subject to the MCTMT if the taxpayer's net earnings from self-employment allocated to the MCTD are $50,000 or less for the tax year. New York TSB-M-12(1)MCTMT. Beginning April 1, 2012, if a business has payroll expense for the quarter of $312,500 or less, the business is not subject to the MCTMT for that quarter. If the business has payroll expenses exceeding $312,500, the tax rate will be between 0.11 percent and 0.34 percent. New York TSB-M-05(7)S. Optional Clothing and Footwear Exemption Counties or cities may elect, but are not required, to enact an exemption for certain clothing and footwear worn by humans sold for less than $110, similar to the state-level exemption for such items. New York TB-ST-122; New York TSB-M-12(3)S (March 6, 2012); New York Publication 718-C. On Nov. 21, 2018, ahead of the Black Friday shopping season, the Department of Taxation issued a press release reminding shoppers of the state's sales tax exemption for clothing and footwear sold for under $110, and listing the local jurisdictions that also provide the exemption. New York Dept. of Taxn. &Fin., Extra Savings with NYS Tax Exemption this Black Friday Temporary Municipal Assistance Sales and Compensating Use Taxes for Cities Under One Million The purpose of a municipal assistance corporation is to assist a municipality in providing services to its residents, while at the same time assisting the municipality in managing and repaying its debt (evidenced by, for example, notes or bonds). Following the creation of a municipal assistance corporation for a city of less than one million residents, state law imposes a tax within the territorial limits of the city. N.Y. Tax Law §1108(a). This tax is generally identical to the state sales and compensating use taxes imposed by N.Y. Tax Law §§ 1105 and 1110, with certain exceptions. N.Y. Tax Law §1108(b). This tax is only in place until the municipal assistance corporation has fully repaid the debt. N.Y. Tax Law §1108(c). Further, the tax is generally imposed on the difference between the municipality's sales and use tax rate and the temporary 3-percent tax (e.g., if a local sales tax applies to a transaction, and the Temporary Municipal Assistance Use Tax also applies at a higher rate, the temporary tax will also apply to the extent of the rate difference). N.Y. Tax Law §1108(b)(5). Local Sales Tax on Retail Sales of Motor Fuel and Diesel Motor Fuel Counties and cities are authorized to impose a local sales tax on motor or diesel motor fuel that is sold at a retail gas station for exclusive use in a motor vehicle. While most localities impose the tax using the percentage rate method, Seneca County imposes the tax using the cents-per-gallon method of computing local tax due. New York Publication 718-F provides a listing of local sales and use tax rates on qualified motor fuel, highway diesel motor fuel, and B20 biodiesel. New York Publication 718-F; New York Notice N-17-1 (Feb. 2017). New York City Sales and Use Tax Distributors of Motor Fuel Generally, New York imposes sales and use tax on each gallon of motor fuel and diesel motor fuel sold or used in New York. Distributors prepay the sales and use taxes on each gallon they import or cause to be imported into New York for use, distribution, storage, or sale in New York, or for which the distributor produces, refines, manufactures, or compounds in New York. Distributors also prepay sales and use tax if the tax has not been imposed before sale by the distributor in New York, except under circumstances where tax collection is precluded. The prepayment rate is determined by the distributor's location. N.Y. Tax Law §1102(a)(1), as amended by 2015 N.Y. S.B. 6409, Part Y, § 4, effective June 1, 2016; New York TSB-M-11(8)S (June 10, 2011); New York Publication 787; New York Publication 790. A distributor of motor fuel is exempt from prepayment of sales and use tax on compressed natural gas, hydrogen, and E85 when it is delivered to a filling station and stored at the filling station to be dispensed directly into a motor vehicle. N.Y. Tax Law §1102(a)(1), as amended by 2015 N.Y. S.B. 6409, Part Y, § 4, effective June 1, 2016. The prepayment rate is determined by the distributor's location. N.Y. Tax Law §1102(a)(1), as amended by 2015 N.Y. S.B. 6409, Part Y, § 4, effective June 1, 2016. Generally, New York City imposes a local sales and compensating use tax similar to the state tax imposed under Article 28 of the New York tax laws. N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2001(a); N.Y. Tax Law §1210(i)(1)(a), as amended by 2019 N.Y. A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019. For variances from the New York state sales and compensating use tax, see N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2001(a). New York City sales tax is imposed on every sale of the following:• beauty, barbering, hair restoring, manicuring, pedicuring, electrolysis, and massage services, sales of services by weight control salons, health salons, gymnasiums, Turkish baths, saunas, and similar establishments, and every charge for the use of the facilities, regardless of whether tangible personal property is transferred in conjunction. N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2002. and • credit rating and credit reporting services, including, but not limited to, those provided by mercantile and consumer credit or reporting bureaus or agencies, except to the extent taxable under Article 28 (Sales and Compensating Use Taxes) of the tax law, until Nov. 30, 2011; N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2040(a). However, services rendered by a physician, osteopath, dentist, nurse, physiotherapist, chiropractor, podiatrist, optometrist, ophthalmic dispenser, or a person performing similar services under title eight of the education law are exempt. Additionally, these services are excluded when performed on pets and other animals. N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2002(a). A 6-percent tax is imposed on providing parking, garaging, or storage for motor vehicles by persons operating a garage, parking lot, or other place of business engaged in providing parking, garaging, or storing of motor vehicles. An additional 8-percent tax is imposed in Manhattan, unless the purchaser is a certified exempt resident. N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2049; New York TB-ST-677; New York TB-ST-679. New York City does not impose tax on:• receipts from laundering, dry cleaning, tailoring, weaving, pressing, shoe repairing, and shoe shining; N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2001(b)(1). and • receipts from the sale of providing parking, garaging, or the storage of motor vehicles at facilities owned and operated by the city, an agency or instrumentality of the city, or a public corporation whose members are appointed by the Mayor or the City Council. N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2001(b)(1). The provisions from the state sales and compensating use tax laws under Articles 28 and 29 that relate or are applicable to the taxes imposed by the New York City Administrative Code in N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2001, including definitions, transitional provisions, limitations, special provisions, exemptions, exclusions, refunds, credits, and administrative provisions, have the same effect in New York City as if the provisions had been fully incorporated into the New York City Administrative Code. However, any state sales and compensating use tax provision that is inconsistent with or not relevant to the local sales and use taxes imposed by the New York City Administrative Code are not incorporated. N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2001(e). The New York City sales and compensating use taxes are administered and collected by the New York Department of Taxation and Finance to Articles 28 and 29 of the New York tax law. N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2001(d). The net collections from the taxes imposed and paid to the city by the state comptroller are credited and deposited in the general fund of the city. No part of the revenues can be expended unless appropriated in the annual city budget. N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2001(f). Local Sales and Use Taxes on Admissions New York taxes charges made to enter a place of amusement. N.Y. Tax Law §1105(f)(1). New York law authorizes cities and counties to impose local sales and use taxes in one of two ways:• sales and use tax may be imposed on the same base as the state sales and use tax; N.Y. Tax Law §1210(iv)(a)(1), as amended by 2019 N.Y. A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019. or • sales and use tax may be imposed on a portion of the state sales and use tax base, including, at the locality's option, admission charges over$0.10. N.Y. Tax Law §1105(f)(1); N.Y. Tax Law §1210(iv)(b)(1), as amended by 2019 N.Y. A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019. Therefore, depending on the method chosen by a city or county, charges made for entrance into a place of amusement may be subject to the local sales and use tax. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(iv)(a)(1), as amended by 2019 N.Y. A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019.
