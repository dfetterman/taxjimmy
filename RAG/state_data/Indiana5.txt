Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal General Rule for Classification

Three-part Test Generally, fixtures are nontaxable as an improvement to real property. However, Indiana considers certain appliances and goods to be taxable tangible personal property regardless of whether these items are affixed to reality. See generally Indiana Letter of Findings 11-0289 (Dec. 29, 2011); Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 65. An “improvement to realty” occurs when personal property is “incorporated into and becomes a permanent part of the real property.” See generally Indiana Letter of Findings 11-0289 (Dec. 29, 2011); Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 65. In determining whether tangible personal property has been affixed to the real property in such a manner as to become a part of the real property, Indiana courts have used a three prong test. The first prong looks at the annexation of the tangible personal property. Annexation may be either actual or constructive. The second prong of the test scrutinizes the use of the tangible personal property as it relates to the real property. The third prong of the test seeks to determine whether there was the intention to make the tangible personal property a permanent attachment to the real property. Home Depot U.S.A. Inc. v. Indiana Dept. of Rev., 891 N.E.2d 187, 2008 BL 158904 (Ind. Tax Ct. 2008). The first element of the test is to be given the least amount of weight. The second element of the test, the relationship between the tangible personal property and the designed use of the land, is to be given “considerable weight,” especially when considered in connection with the third element, the element of intent. It is settled law that the element of intent is the most important element of the part test. Milestone Contractors, L.P. v. Ind. Bell Tel. Co., 739 N.E.2d 174 (Ind. Ct. App.2000); Home Depot U.S.A. Inc. v. Indiana Dept. of Rev., 891 N.E.2d 187, 2008 BL 158904 (Ind. Tax Ct. 2008). In Milestone Contractors, LP v. Indiana Bell Telephone Co., d/b/a Ameritech, the court was called upon to analyze whether cables buried under ground in an easement granted to Ameritech were serving the real property or the easement. Noting that “[t]he tendency [in Indiana law] is to regard everything as a fixture which has been attached to realty to promote the purpose for which the realty [is] held, regardless of the character of the attachment,” the court held that the cables served the part of the real property that Ameritech was entitled to use (the easement)because the cables were helping the service provider provide services to their customers, which was the entire purpose of the easement. Milestone Contractors, LP v. Ind. Bell Tel. Co., 739 N.E.2d 174 (Ind. Ct. App. 2000). The intent of the affixer may be determined by examining “the nature of the article, relation, and situation”of the affixer as well as “the structure, use, and mode of annexation.”Likewise, “it is the third part of the test which is controlling. If there is doubt as to intent, the property should be regarded as personal.” Dinsmore v. Lake Elec. Co., 719 N.E.2d 1282 (Ind. Ct. App. 1999). In some states, the sale and installation upon real property of complete items of tangible personal property such as kitchen appliances and electronic equipment, sometimes referred to as “fixtures”, is treated as a taxable sale of tangible personal property the same as if these items were sold uninstalled. The Indiana Department of Revenue has released a bulletin following this rule. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 60. Indiana considers the following items to remain tangible personal property following affixation:• home stereos; • televisions; • refrigerators; • stoves; • dishwashers; • garbage compactors; and • washers and dryers. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 60. By contrast, the following items are generally considered to become part of real property following affixation:• garbage disposals; • water heaters; • water softeners; • alarms; • furnaces;and • central air conditioning units. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 60. Under lump-sum sale-and-installation contracts, the classification of an item as tangible personal property following affixation will result in the entire contract being taxed as a unitary transaction for the sale of tangible personal property. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-1-1(a); Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-1-1(a); Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 60. If an item installed under a lump-sum contract is instead treated as becoming part of real property, the contractor must pay use tax on the item and the charges to the contractee are not subject to tax. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-4-26(a); Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 60. For separated “time and material”contracts, a contractor must collect and remit sales tax on the separately stated charges for items affixed to real property, regardless of whether they retain or lose their character as tangible personal property. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-4-9(b)(2), as amended by 2016 Ind. S.B. 309, effective retroactively January 1, 2010; see also Indiana Tax Dispatch June 2016. Amounts charged for labor under time and material contracts are not subject to tax. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 60. The Indiana Department of Revenue unsuccessfully argued in Lowe's Home Centers., LLC v. Indiana Dept. of Rev. that retailers must collect gross retail (sales)tax on items they incorporate into real property under lump-sum construction contracts. The Indiana Tax Court ruled in favor of Lowe's that because its customers did not receive title to the items until they had been converted to real property, Lowe's appropriately paid use tax on its cost price of the items. Lowe's Home Ctrs., LLC v. Indiana Dept. of Rev., 23 N.E.3d 52, 2014 BL 359452 (Ind. Tax Ct. 2014). BNA-SUTN IN 28.2.1.

Depends The sale and installation of signage is treated as a taxable retail sale if the signage retains its identity as tangible personal property or is installed under a time-and-material contract, and is treated as a nontaxable sale of construction services if the signage is converted to real property under a lump-sum contract. See Indiana Revenue Ruling 2016-03ST (May 3, 2018). The Indiana Department of State Revenue has ruled that signage becomes a component part of real property if embedded in the ground or bolted to real property, and that it retains its identity as tangible personal property if mounted upon real property with adhesive tape.

A contractor under a time and materials contract that purchases materials without paying tax and does not collect tax on the materials from the customer is subject to use tax on the materials. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20130472 (out-of-state installer of voice and data equipment subject to use tax after failing to pay or collect sales tax on equipment that was installed). A contractor under a time and materials contract may claim a credit for any Indiana sales tax paid on materials used under the contract. However, if the sales tax was paid to another state, the contractor may not claim the credit. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20130269(Dec. 31, 2014). Examples of construction materials that are incorporated into real property include doors, garage doors, windows, cabinets, garbage disposals, water heaters, water softeners, alarms, furnaces, central air conditioning units, gutters, carpeting, and fencing. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 60. Items such as computers, home stereos, refrigerators, stoves, dishwashers, garbage compactors, clothes washers and dryers, and window air conditioning units are not considered construction materials Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-4-25(b); Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 60. Any charges for delivery of tangible personal property included in a time and materials contract are subject to sales tax. Contractors that enter into lump sum contracts must pay sales tax or accrue use tax on any delivery charges incurred by the contractor with regard to the tangible personal property transferred pursuant to such contracts. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-1-5; Indiana Commissioner's Directive 23. If a contractor acquires materials free-of-charge but charges a fee to deliver the materials to the customer, the transaction is subject to tax. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20120225 (May 28, 2014) (delivery of rock and dirt was subject to tax because a single unitary price was charged for the service of hauling the material even though the rock and dirt was acquired free-of-charge). Public Safety Equipment A construction contractor's purchase of public safety equipment required by contract to be used in the construction and repair of public roads, bridges, highways, and other public infrastructure for a governmental entity is exempt from sales and use tax. Examples include but are not limited to, traffic signals, signs, barrels, barricades, temporary pavement markings, materials to construct temporary traffic lanes, roads, bridges, erosion control, drainage materials, aggregates used to set grades, and field offices and communications equipment provided such offices and equipment are exclusively for the use of government representatives.

Depends The nature of HVAC installation, particularly the intent that it be permanently installed, will likely result in it being considered a fixture. See Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-1-1 et seq. In determining whether tangible personal property has been affixed to the real property in such a manner as to become a part of the real property, Indiana courts have used a three prong test. The first prong looks at the annexation of the tangible personal property. Annexation may be either actual or constructive. The second prong of the test scrutinizes the use of the tangible personal property as it relates to the real property. The third prong of the test seeks to determine whether there was the intention to make the tangible personal property a permanent attachment to the real property. Milestone Contractors, L.P. v. Ind. Bell Tel. Co., 739 N.E.2d 174 (Ind. Ct. App.2000). Generally, the installation of a fixture is nontaxable as an improvement to real property. If the HVAC system is installed as part of a lump sum contract, the contractor performing the installation must pay tax on the materials used. If the contractor separately invoices the charge for labor and materials, they must collect tax from their customer for the materials. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-1-1.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Contractor Classifications

Defined A manufacturer contractor is a construction contractor who manufactures, fabricates, or assembles raw materials into new components to be used as construction materials. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 60. Sales tax will be collected, or use tax will be due, on the total cost of the raw materials that are converted into new component parts for construction into real property. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 60. A manufacturer contractor operating pursuant to a lump sum contract is required to pay sales tax on the cost of the raw materials at the time of purchase or use tax on the cost of the materials at the time they are converted into a new component for construction into real property. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-4-21(b); Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 60 . When a manufacturer contractor operates under a time and material contract, the contractor is permitted to purchase the raw materials exempt for resale by submitting a properly completed ST-105 General Sales Tax Exemption Certificate to the retailer. However, when a manufacturer contractor purchases pre-fabricated materials to be incorporated into real property, the manufacturer contractor is required to pay sales tax on the entire retail transaction. The retail transaction includes any labor charges associated with the fabrication of the materials. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-3-12; Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 60 . The term “contractor” means any person engaged in converting construction material into real property on behalf of another person.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Contracts with Exempt Entities

Exempt A construction contractor is not subject to use tax on construction materials that the contractor coverts to real property under a lump-sum contract with an entity that could have purchased the materials itself exempt from tax, provided that the contractor received a valid exemption certificate from the exempt entity. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-3-2(c)(2), as amended by 2016 Ind. S.B. 309, effective retroactively January 1, 2010; Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-4-22(e). Additionally, when a contractor converts construction materials to real property under a time and material contract with an entity that could have purchased the materials exempt from tax, the contractor's separately stated material charges are not subject to gross retail (sales) tax. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-4-9(c), as amended by 2016 Ind. S.B. 309, effective retroactively January 1, 2010. Contractors must receive a valid exemption certificate from the exempt entity in order to make tax-exempt purchases for a contract with that entity. Purchases made by contractors who have not received valid exemption certificates are taxable. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20160658 (July 26, 2017); see also Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20160481 (Sept. 27, 2017) (explaining circumstances under which contractors may make tax-exempt purchases of materials). Machinery, tools, equipment, and supplies used by a contractor to perform a construction contract are not construction materials, and are therefore, not exempt regardless of the exempt status of the person for whom the contract is performed. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-3-7(c); Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 60 . Public Safety Equipment A construction contractor's purchase of public safety equipment required by contract to be used in the construction and repair of public roads, bridges, highways, and other public infrastructure for a governmental entity is exempt from sales and use tax. Examples include but are not limited to, traffic signals, signs, barrels, barricades, temporary pavement markings, materials to construct temporary traffic lanes, roads, bridges, erosion control, drainage materials, aggregates used to set grades, and field offices and communications equipment provided such offices and equipment are exclusively for the use of government representatives. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-16; Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20140437 (April 29, 2015) (taxpayer's purchase of public safety items required by government contracts to be used in performing contract jobs are exempt from sales tax).

Depends Manufactured Homes Gross retail (sales) tax applies to 65 percent of the amount paid for a new manufactured home. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-29. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 65. When acting as a lump-sum contractor, a dealer must remit use tax on 65 percent of the wholesale invoice price of a manufactured home. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-29. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 65. The sale of a used manufactured home is exempt from the gross retail (sales)and use tax. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 65. A manufactured home is a home that satisfies the definition set forth in 42 U.S.C. §5402(6). Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-29. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 65. Modular Homes Modular homes are not considered manufactured homes. Manufactured homes are built on a chassis to ensure transportability; modular homes are not attached to a chassis, are not movable without special equipment and are permanently attached to a foundation. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 65. The Indiana Tax Court has held that use tax does not apply to materials purchased and processed into building components outside the state and used to construct buildings within Indiana. Morton Bldgs. Inc. v. Indiana Dept. of Rev., 819 N.E.2d 913 (Ind. Tax Ct. 2004). In Morton Buildings, the taxpayer, an Illinois company, sold and erected pre-fabricated buildings for use in Indiana and in other states. The taxpayer purchased raw materials outside of the state and made them into building components at factories located outside the state. When a customer ordered a building, the taxpayer withdrew the necessary raw materials from storage and made them into building components. These materials included lumber, nails, cement, staples, insulation and plastic sheeting. The taxpayer sought a refund on all of the use taxes it paid to Indiana for the cost of the raw materials it used at its factories outside the state to make building components used in Indiana. The taxpayer argued that the raw materials in issue were not “purchased from a retailer”because the building components made out of the raw materials were new and different items of tangible personal property. In its analysis, the tax court applied the following test to determine if the imposition of use tax on the raw materials in issue was proper:• the item of tangible personal property must be used, stored or consumed in Indiana; and • the item of personal property must be purchased from a retailer (not manufactured by the user). Morton Bldgs. Inc. v. Indiana Dept. of Rev., 819 N.E.2d 913 (Ind. Tax Ct. 2004). The tax court held that the manufacturing process that was performed upon the raw materials did transform the raw materials into something that was not purchased from a retailer. As a result, the conversion of raw materials into identifiably distinguishable personal property excludes the raw materials from continued taxability under the use tax. Morton Bldgs. Inc. v. Indiana Dept. of Rev., 819 N.E.2d 913 (Ind. Tax Ct. 2004). BNA-SUTN IN 28.8.
