Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal General Rule for Classification

Taxable Oklahoma provides that sales of “materials purchased to develop and improve real property” are taxable to the contractor rather than the party for whom the improvements have been made. Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-19-56(b). This includes any device or appliance used by builders, contractors or landowners in making improvements, additions, alterations or repairs to real property in such a way that the tangible personal property becomes identified with a part of realty. Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-19-107(a). “Fixtures” Defined A device or appliance becomes a fixture and part of the real property to which it is affixed when removal of the tangible personal property would result in substantial damage to the real property. Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-19-107(b). If removal of the tangible personal property would not result in substantial damage, then the tangible personal property may still be considered affixed to the property if the tangible personal property is physically connected to the real property in the same way and the use or purpose of the tangible personal property has become an element of the use or purpose of the real property. Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-19-107(c)(1); Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-19-107(c)(2). Exceptions These rules do not apply to stoves, refrigerators, dishwashers, washing machines, dryers, curtains, draperies, and portable heaters purchased by the owner of the real property for personal use, as long as the items can be removed without material damage to the buildings in which they are used. Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-19-107(d). BNA-SUTN OK 28.2.1.
