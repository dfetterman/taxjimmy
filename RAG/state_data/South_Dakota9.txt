Predominant Activity South Dakota uses the “predominant activity” test to determine whether a transaction qualifies as a service. S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §10-45-4.1; In re Pirmantgen, 2008 SD 127 (S.D. 2008). The contracting parties'intended use, principal objective, or ultimate objective does not control. Thus, if an activity predominantly involves the performance of a service rather than the sale of property then the activity will be considered a service. S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §10-45-4.1; see Nash Finch Co. v. Dept. of Rev. & Reg., 312 N.W.2d 470, 472 (S.D. 1981). The South Dakota Supreme Court has ruled that the provider of an all-inclusive hunting package did not owe use tax on the components of the package because sales tax was charged to the customer on the price of the entire package. The items contained in the package, food, beverages, ammunition, etc, could not be purchased separately, but rather as the complete package. The Department of Revenue's position was that these products were used by the taxpayer in providing a service. However, the Court found that the customers were actually purchasing the items from the taxpayer because the customer was providing consideration for the items. Therefore, use tax was not owed because the sales tax was paid on the entire charge. Paul Nelson Farm v. Dept. of Rev. & Reg., 847 N.W.2d 550, 2014 SD 31 (S.D. 2014). BNA-SUTN SD 9.3.1.
