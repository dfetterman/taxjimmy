Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Local Option Sales and Use Tax

No Local Tax Michigan localities are not authorized to impose a local sales and use tax. However, the Michigan Constitution grants broad taxing authority to charter counties, cities, and villages in Michigan. Mich. Const., art. VII, §2; Mich. Const., art. VII, §21. However, in 1970, the Michigan Attorney General concluded that localities do not have the authority to levy a sales and use tax. Michigan Attorney General Opinion 1969-70, No. 4694 (June 18, 1970). As a result, sales and use tax is not imposed at the local level within the state of Michigan. Mich. Dept. of Treas., Who Needs A Sales Tax License?; Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Bd., Current State Tax Rates. While a sales and use tax is not authorized at the local level, each charter county, city, and village is granted the power to levy “other taxes” for public purposes, subject to limitations and prohibitions of the constitution or Michigan law. Mich. Const., art. VII, §2; Mich. Const., art. VII, §21. Most significantly, a city or village cannot impose a tax (other than an ad valorem property tax) unless the tax was in effect on Jan. 1, 1964, or is otherwise provided by state law. Mich. Comp. Laws §141.91. BNA-SUTN MI 1.1.3.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Use' or 'Storage, Use, or Consumption'

Defined “Use”means the exercise of a right or power over tangible personal property incident to the ownership of that property. Use includes the transfer of property in a transaction where possession is given. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.92(b). The conversion of tangible personal property originally acquired for an exempt use is a taxable use. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.92(b). “Storage” means the keeping or retaining of property in Michigan for any purpose after the property loses its interstate character. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.92(c). In NACG Leasing LLC v. Michigan Dept. of Treas., the Michigan Supreme Court held that a taxpayer was subject to use tax when it purchased an aircraft from an out-of-state company, and simultaneously leased the aircraft to a related entity that had possession and control over the aircraft in Michigan at the time of transfer. The court concluded that the taxpayer “used”the aircraft, because in leasing the aircraft, the taxpayer exercised a right incident to ownership in Michigan. NACG Leasing LLC v. Michigan Dept. of Treas., No. 146234, 2014 BL 36494 (Mich. Ct. App. 2014); see also CDM Leasing LLC v. Michigan Dept. of Treas., No. 317987, 2014 BL 357426 (Mich. Ct. App. 2014) (subjecting taxpayer to use tax on an aircraft leased for personal use). In Podmajersky v. Michigan Dept. of Treas., the taxpayer was found responsible for use tax on a yacht that had been immobilized in Michigan within 90 days of its purchase. While the court of appeals discussed at length the taxpayer's attempts to avoid paying use tax in any jurisdiction, they ultimately settled on a strict interpretation of their use tax imposition statute, deciding that since the yacht was stored and used in Michigan within 90 days of its purchase, it was subject to Michigan use tax. Podmajersky v. Michigan Dept. of Treas., 2013 BL 214298 (Mich. Ct. App. 2013). Where a company marketed its products to hospitals in Michigan and then sent those products to Michigan hospitals for exclusive use in Michigan with no expectation that the instruments would return from Michigan, the company “used” its products in Michigan. Michigan Administrative Decision 17-005054 (May 6, 2019). In order to be entitled to an exemption from use tax, the burden rests on the taxpayer to show that the sales tax was due and paid on the sale of tangible personal property. Andrie, Inc. v. Michigan Dept. of Treas., 2014 BL 175757 (Mich. 2014) (a Michigan corporation was not able to demonstrate that it paid sales tax on purchases of fuel and other supplies for its marine construction and transportation business because the invoices for those items did not list sales tax as a separate line item; the court held that there is no presumption that sales tax is automatically included in the purchase price of an item when a receipt does not list sales tax as a separate item, therefore, the corporation was not entitled to an exemption from use tax).
