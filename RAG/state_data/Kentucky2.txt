Admin. Regs. 31:030(1). Upon receiving a DPA, the taxpayer must give all vendors a copy of the DPA form, 103 Ky. Admin. Regs. 31:030(4)(1). which if accepted by the vendor in good faith and retained by the vendor in compliance with the record-keeping requirements, relieves the vendor of the duty of collecting and paying the sales and use tax. 103 Ky. Admin. Regs. 31:030(5)(1). It becomes the taxpayer's duty to report and remit the sales and use tax on all taxable purchase of tangible personal property, excluding energy and energy producing fuels, that would have been remitted by the vendor if the taxpayer was not a holder of a DPA. 103 Ky. Admin. Regs. 31:030(5)(2). A holder of a DPA may be required by the Revenue Cabinet to execute a bond or indemnity agreement securing the payment of sales and use tax in an amount not less than$75,000 and not greater than three times the estimated monthly liability. 103 Ky.

Regs. 31:030(2)(4). and • either: o be engaged in business in Kentucky and own property, other than office furniture and equipment, that is located in more than one state; 103 Ky. Admin. Regs. 31:030(2)(5). or o have been engaged in business in Kentucky for more than 24 months and have purchased tangible personal property of at least $10 million dollars for use in Kentucky operations in the preceding calendar or fiscal year. 103 Ky. Admin. Regs. 31:030(2)(6). Limitations A taxpayer holding a DPA may not issue the DPA to a construction contractor or allow a contractor to use the DPA to purchase, lease, or rent tangible personal property or purchase taxable services. 103 Ky. Admin. Regs. 31:030(6). Additionally, the DPA is not transferable upon the sale, lease, or other transfer of the business, and the Revenue Cabinet must be notified within 10 days of the effective date of a sale, lease, or other transfer of the business. 103 Ky. Admin. Regs. 31:030(9). Termination A DPA must be terminated by the Revenue Cabinet for any of the following reasons:• failure to be an eligible taxpayer; 103 Ky. Admin.

Energy Direct Pay Authorization(EDPA) Kentucky exempts energy or energy-producing fuels used in the course of manufacturing, processing, mining, or refining and any related distribution, transmission, and transportation services for the energy that are billed to the user, to the extent that the cost of the energy or energy-producing fuels used, and related distribution, transmission, and transportation services for the energy that are billed to the user exceed 3 percent of the cost of production. See Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §139.480(3); 103 Ky. Admin. Regs. 30:140. Taxpayers who qualify for the exemption must apply for an EDPA with the Department of Revenue. 103 Ky. Admin. Regs. 30:140(4)(1). This variety of a direct pay authorization may not be used for any purchases other than those for energy or energy-producing fuels. 103 Ky. Admin. Regs. 30:140(7). Applicants for an EDPA must set forth an itemization of the accounts included in cost of production based on costs incurred in the last completed fiscal or calendar year ending prior to the date of the application. 103 Ky. Admin. Regs. 30:140(6)(1). If the energy cost and any related distribution, transmission, and transportation services for the energy that are billed to the user does not exceed 3 percent of the cost of production, an EDPA is not issued. 103 Ky. Admin. Regs. 30:140(9). If the energy cost and any related distribution, transmission, and transportation services for the energy that are billed to the user exceeds 3 percent of the cost of production, the taxpayer must do the following:• estimate the tax by multiplying the cost of production by 3 percent and multiplying the resulting figure by 6 percent; and • report and make monthly payments equal to one-twelfth of the total estimated tax. 103 Ky. Admin. Regs. 30:140(5)(3). Cost of production is the total of all costs, according to accepted accounting principles, incurred in manufacturing, mining, processing, or refining of tangible personal property computed on the basis of plant facilities except for the cost of the energy or energy-producing fuels used and the related distribution, transmission, and transportation services for this energy that are billed to the user. 103 Ky. Admin. Regs. 30:140(1). A company is not required to include the costs of production of separate and distinct business operations, even if they are all located on the same or adjoining land. A company is only required to include the costs of production attributable to the business operation that the exemption will apply to. Revenue Cabinet v. James B. Beam Distilling Co., No. 89–SC-000697–DG (Ky. 1990). Four months after the end of each fiscal or calendar year ending subsequent to the date of the authorization, the taxpayer must file a “Kentucky Sales and Use Tax Energy Exemption Annual Return, reconciling the estimate to the amount of tax due. If additional tax is due, the taxpayer must pay the tax due, or if no additional tax is due, the taxpayer may credit the overpayment on next year's estimate or apply for a refund. The taxpayer must also make an estimate for the succeeding year and adjust the payment for the months remaining so that the total tax to be paid for the year will agree with the total estimated tax. 103 Ky. Admin. Regs. 30:140(6). BNA-SUTN KY 31.8.10.

4 Years The Department of Revenue has four years from the due date or the date upon which the return was filed, whichever is later, to issue a timely notice assessing additional sales and use tax. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §139.610(1). Under Kentucky law, an assessment of additional tax has been made within the 4 year statute of limitations if the notice is dated prior to tolling of the statute of limitations unless the taxpayer can establish that the notice was not received prior to deadline. See GTE South Inc. v. Kentucky Rev. Cab., 2007 BL 96526 (Ky. 2007) (A notice of interest and penalties, dated four days prior to tolling of the statute of limitations, was considered timely issued because the taxpayer bore the burden of proof and produced no evidence indicating that the letter was not received before the deadline. Although the taxpayer claimed that the letter was post-marked and received after the deadline, he could not produce the postmarked envelope or any other supporting evidence. The court found it significant that the taxpayer retained the postmark-bearing envelopes for all other correspondences with the Department except the notice in question). The statute of limitations does not apply, and the additional tax liability can be assessed at any time, if the taxpayer has either failed to file, or filed a fraudulent return. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §139.620(1). The Department of Revenue and a taxpayer may enter into an agreement extending the statute of limitations for the assessment of additional taxes. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §139.610. Once the Department has assessed additional tax liability to a taxpayer, it is required to mail the taxpayer a notice of such assessment. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §139.620(1). The assessment is due and payable, if not protested, within 45 days from the date of the notice for assessments issued prior to July 1, 2018, and 60 days from the date of notice for assessments issued on or after July 1, 2018. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §131.110(1)(a), as amended by 2018 Ky. H.B. 487, effective July 1, 2018. BNA-SUTN KY 31.11.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Civil Penalties

Yes Kentucky authorizes the Department of Revenue to impose various penalties for failures to comply with the sales and use tax provisions. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §131.180(1). Late Filing of Tax Return The Department of Revenue imposes a 2 percent penalty on any outstanding tax liability filed after the due date. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §131.180(1). The penalty of 2 percent accrues every 30 days, or fraction thereof, that the tax remains past due. However, the penalty cannot exceed 20 percent of the total outstanding tax liability. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §131.180(1). Failure to Withhold or Pay Tax The Department of Revenue imposes a 2 percent penalty on taxpayers who fail to withhold or collect any tax when they are lawfully obligated to, or to pay at least 75 percent of the tax due by them. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §131.180(2). The 2 percent penalty is imposed on the amount of the tax not withheld, collected, or paid by the taxpayer. The 2 percent penalty accrues in periods of 30 days, or fractions thereof, for as long as the taxpayer is delinquent. The penalty assessed by the department may not exceed 20 percent of the outstanding tax liability. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §131.180(2). Assessed Tax If the Department of Revenue assesses additional tax to a taxpayer, that additional tax is subject to a penalty. If the tax assessed is a result of taxpayer negligence, then the penalty imposed is 10 percent of the amount of tax assessed. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §131.180(7). However, if the tax assessed is a result of taxpayer fraud or intentional misrepresentation, the penalty imposed will be equal to 50 percent of the imposed tax. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §131.180(8).

Yes Kentucky offers a voluntary disclosure program. Kentucky Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Process. To take advantage of the program, a taxpayer may have a representative submit the following information:• For a business — a brief description of the taxpayer's operation, the number of years the business has been operating, and the nature and extent of business operations in Kentucky. This description must include whether the business owns or leases property, has employees, or has other potential taxable activities in Kentucky. • For an individual — The appropriate number of years the taxpayer was required to pay tax in Kentucky. A distinction between resident and nonresident years must be made. • Whether or not the Department of Revenue has contacted the taxpayer. If so, the nature of the contact. • The disclosure terms proposed by the taxpayer. Generally the Department of Revenue requires a four-year “look back” period for all tax types. • If the tax nexus is so nebulous that the taxpayer believes prospective filing is justified, the Department of Revenue prefers that the taxpayer simply register and go forward from that point. Under normal circumstances, the Department of Revenue will not waive any past liability as part of a prospective filing. Kentucky Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Process. All information submitted by the taxpayer will be included in a Statement of Representations and Inducements, included in the disclosure agreement, used to determine whether the Department of Revenue will accept the disclosure. If significant misrepresentations are found in this statement, or in any of the other representations made to support the disclosure, the agreement may be considered void and any additional taxes, penalty, and interest will be assessed. Kentucky Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Process. Based on the information received, the Department of Revenue will work with the representative of the taxpayer to come to a disclosure agreement. When the terms of the disclosure are finalized, the Department of Revenue will prepare a disclosure agreement for review and approval by the taxpayer. Generally the taxpayer has 90 days to comply and execute the disclosure. Kentucky Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Process. The Department of Revenue will register the taxpayer at the time the signed agreement is received. The taxpayer has 90 days from the completion of the executed agreement to file returns or adequate schedules and submit payment of the tax.
