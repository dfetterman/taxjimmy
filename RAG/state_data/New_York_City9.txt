Depends New York City generally imposes tax on the same services taxed at the state level. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(a)(1). Generally, the state of New York does not subject sales of services to sales and use taxes unless they are specifically enumerated as taxable. N.Y. Tax Law §1105; N.Y. Tax Law §1110; New York TB-ST-740 (general guide to taxable and exempt property and services). Additionally, New York City taxes certain enumerated services not subject to tax at the state level at a rate of 4.5 percent and conversely exempts certain services that are subject to tax at the state level. See N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2002; N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2040. For example, New York City no longer taxes interior decorating and design services. Such services are subject to the state sales tax and the MTCD tax. New York TSB-M-95(13)S (Dec. 1, 1995); New York TB-ST-400. BNA-SUTN NYC 9.2.

Differs from State The state of New York authorizes New York City to impose local sales and use taxes in either of two ways. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(a)(1); N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2001(a). The first, which the city has adopted, is to enact all the taxes, exemptions, and provisions(other than the rate of tax), described in the state sales and use tax statutes, with certain exceptions and differences. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(a)(1); N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2001(a). The second permits cities and counties to enact only a portion of the state sales and use tax statutes. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(b)(1). Accordingly, New York City has enacted the state's tax laws and imposes a sales and use tax at a rate of 4.5 percent. N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2001(a); N.Y. Tax Law §1210(i)(1); see also New York TSB-M-08(9)S (Aug. 28, 2008). With a few important exceptions, New York City's sales and use tax applies to all transactions subject to New York State sales and use tax. See N.Y. Tax Law §1210(a); N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2001(a); N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2001(b); N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2001(e). New York City generally imposes tax on the same base taxed at the state level. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(a)(1); N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2001(a). For more information on how New York State taxes mixed transactions, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at New York 9.3.1. BNA-SUTN NYC 9.3.1.

Same as State Generally, in the state of New York, when taxable and exempt items are sold as a single unit, the tax must be collected on the entire selling price. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.1(b). However, when a transaction includes a taxable and nontaxable component and the taxable component is not incidental to the provision of service, the items must be separately stated, otherwise tax must be collected on the entire selling price for both components. New York TSB-A-98(33)S (May 20, 1998). If a seller sells taxable and exempt items as a single unit, then the seller must collect tax on the entire sales price. N.Y. Comp.

Differs from State New York City is authorized by the state of New York to impose local sales and use taxes in one of two ways. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(a)(1); N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2001(a). The first, which the City has adopted, is to enact all the taxes, exemptions, and provisions(other than the rate of tax), described in the state sales and use tax statutes, with some differences. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(a)(1); N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2001(a). The second permits cities and counties to enact only a portion of the state sales and use tax statutes. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(b)(1). However, before Aug. 1, 2008, New York City was authorized by the state of New York to enact the tax laws described in the state sales and use tax statutes at a rate of 4 percent, with some variations and exceptions. N.Y. Tax Law §1107(a). The proceeds of the tax were remitted to the city's Municipal Assistance Corporation (MAC) and the tax remained in effect until the City's MAC bonds were paid off, which occurred in July 2008. N.Y. Tax Law §1107(d); New York TSB-M-08(9)S (Aug. 28, 2008). Upon expiration of the MAC sales tax, New York City, as authorized by the state of New York, N.Y. Tax Law §1210(a)(1). resumed its local sales tax. New York TSB-M-08(9)S (Aug. 28, 2008). Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Mobility Tax (MCTMT) In addition, New York State requires all sales made in New York City that are subject to the state sales and use tax to be subject to the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Mobility Tax. N.Y. Tax Law §1109(a); see Mangano v. Silver, 107 A.D.3d 956, 2013 BL 169397 (N.Y. App. Div. 2013) (the MCTMT was not unconstitutionally passed without a home rule message because the law serves a substantial state concern and is thus exempt from the home rule message requirement). Generally, New York City sales and use tax applies to the same base as the state sales and use tax. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(a)(1); N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2001(a); see N.Y.C. Admin.

Specifically, the definitions, transitional provisions, limitations, special provisions, exemptions, exclusions, refunds, credits, and administrative provisions of the state's sales and use tax statutes, insofar as they can be made applicable to New York City sales and use taxes, apply with the same force and effect as if they had been incorporated in full and had expressly referred to the City's sales and use taxes. N.Y.C. Admin. Code §11-2001(e). However, any state sales and use tax provision that is inconsistent with or not relevant to the local sales and use taxes imposed by the New York City Administrative Code are not incorporated. N.Y.C.
