Topic: Administration and Procedure Agencies Responsible for Administration Local Sales and Use Tax

Colorado Department of Revenue or Local Home Rule The Colorado Department of Revenue administers, collects, and enforces all sales and use taxes enacted by its state-administered localities, and the local home rule jurisdictions administer, collect, and enforce all sales and use taxes enacted by their statutory localities. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-106. Administration of these local taxes is to be in accordance with the state sales and use tax collection procedures. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-106(1). The Department of Revenue may charge the locality a fee for collecting use taxes on motor vehicles. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-106(3)(b). It may not impose a fee for the collection of any other sales and use tax. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-106(3)(a). Additionally, the state requires vendors to collect and remit the local sales taxes in the same manner as the state sales and use tax. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-106(3)(c)(I). However, a vendor's liability to collect and remit this tax is relieved if a purchaser provides a vendor with a direct payment permit number. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-106(3)(c)(I); Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-106(3)(c)(II). Upon providing this direct payment number, the purchaser becomes liable for remitting any sales or use tax due to the Department of Revenue. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-106(3)(c)(I); Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-106(3)(c)(II). Vendors collecting and remitting these taxes timely may retain a portion of the taxes due as a service fee to cover the vendor's expense of collecting and remitting the tax to the Department of Revenue. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-106(9)(b). This service fee varies by locality from zero to 3.33 percent. Form DR 1002 Colorado Sales/Use Tax Rates. All sales taxes are reported on the sales tax return, DR 0100. Form DR 1002 Colorado Sales/Use Tax Rates; Colorado FYI Sales 62. Any use tax on purchases not previously taxed but required to be paid is reported on Form DR 0252, Consumer Use Tax Return. Colorado FYI Sales 62. Special Taxing Districts Generally The Colorado Department of Revenue is responsible for administering, collecting, and enforcing all sales and use taxes enacted by all state-administered special taxing districts. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-1-204.5(3)(f.1)(I); Colo. Rev. Stat. §30-20-604.5(2)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-14-114(2)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-15-110(2)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-9-119(2)(c)(I); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-13-107(2); Colo. Rev. Stat. §43-4-605(1)(j)(I). Administration of these local taxes is conducted in accordance with the state sales and use tax collection procedures. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-1-204.5(3)(f.1)(I); Colo. Rev. Stat. §30-20-604.5(2)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-14-114(2)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-15-110(2)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-15-110(2)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-13-107(2); Colo. Rev. Stat. §43-4-605(1)(j)(I). Vendors are required to collect and remit the local sales tax in the same manner as the state sales and use tax. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-1-204.5(3)(f.1)(I); Colo. Rev. Stat. §30-20-604.5(2)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-14-114(2)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-15-110(2)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-9-119(2)(c); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-13-107(2); Colo. Rev. Stat. §43-4-605(1)(j)(I). Additionally, the Department of Revenue may charge the district a fee for collecting its sales and use taxes, but the department may not charge a fee for collection of the mass transit sales tax. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-1-204.5(3)(f.1)(III); Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-106(3)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §30-20-604.5(2)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-14-114(2)(a): Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-9-119(2)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-9-119(2)(c)(II); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-13-107(2); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-13-110(2)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §43-4-605(1)(j)(I). This fee may not exceed the amount paid by a locality in 1993-1994 fiscal year, save for the adjustment based upon the consumer price index. Colo. Rev. Stat. §30-20-604.5(2)(a)(I); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-14-114(2)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-9-119(2)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-9-119(2)(c)(II); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-13-107(2); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-13-110(2)(a). All tax collected by the Department of Revenue, less its fee, will be distributed monthly to the districts that collected the tax. The distribution will be based on the amount of revenue collected by the Department of Revenue in any given jurisdiction. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-1-204.5(3)(f.1)(II); Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-106(3)(c)(I); Colo. Rev. Stat. §30-20-604.5(2)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-14-114(2)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-15-110(2)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-9-119(2)(c)(II); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-13-107(2); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-13-110(2)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §43-4-605(1)(j)(I). With the exception of certain special districts which have been authorized by statute to impose a use tax, no local county or municipality is permitted to collect a use tax on the purchase of tangible personal property or taxable services occurring within its borders, with a few exceptions. The exceptions allow local jurisdictions to impose a use tax on motor vehicles registered within their borders as well as construction and building materials purchased or transported into the jurisdiction. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-109(1); Colorado FYI Sales 62; see, e.g., Colorado Private Letter Ruling PLR-16-0010 (April 18, 2015). Additionally, if the locality imposes a use tax, construction equipment located within the jurisdiction for a period of less than 30 days is subject to use tax. The amount of use tax due is based on the following calculation: purchase price of the equipment multiplied by one twelfth. Purchasers of the equipment are permitted to take a credit for any local sales tax already paid on the equipment. However, property is not subject to additional use tax upon entering a taxing jurisdiction, if it has been significantly used for its primary purpose within Colorado for at least three years from the date of sale. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-109(2). Generally, local sales tax applies to the purchase or sale if the transaction is subject to state sales tax and consummated within a county, or incorporated city and town borders that imposes a local sales tax. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(1)(d)(I). Taxable transactions are sourced to the localities using the same sourcing method used to source the state sales and use tax. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(1)(d)(I). Affiliate nexus rules apply the same to state-administered localities as applied at the state level. See, e.g., Colorado General Information Letter GIL-12-016 (Dec. 31, 2012). All the exemptions that apply at the state level generally apply at the local level, except for a number of specific exemptions that local cities and counties can opt into or out of at the time that they enact their local sales and use tax statutes. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(1)(d)(I); Form DR 1002 Colorado Sales/Use Tax Rates. The optional sales tax exemptions are:• food for home consumption; Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(1)(d)(I)(C). • machinery and machine tools; Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(1)(d)(I)(A). • gas, electricity, and so on for residential use; Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(1)(d)(I)(B). • occasional sales by charitable organizations; Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(1)(d)(I)(E). • farm equipment; Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(1)(d)(I)(F). • pesticides; Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(1)(d)(I)(H). • food sold through vending machines; Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(1)(d)(I)(D). • low-emitting vehicles; Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(1)(d)(I)(G). • telephone and telegraph service; Colo. Rev. Stat. §30-20-604.5(1). This exemption is only available for local improvement districts. • gas and electricity for residential and commercial use; Colo. Rev. Stat. §30-20-604.5(1). This exemption is only available for local improvement districts. • renewable energy components; Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(1)(d)(I)(J). • beetle wood products; Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(1)(d)(I)(I). and • school related sales. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(1)(d)(I)(K); Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(1)(d)(I)(L). Additionally, purchases of construction and building materials, as well as purchases of other tangible personal property or taxable services are not subject to sales tax if local sales tax was previously paid in another Colorado taxing jurisdiction. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(2); Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(3); Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(4). Instead, the taxing jurisdiction must give a credit for the taxes previously paid; but such credit may not exceed the applicable tax in the taxing jurisdiction granting the credit. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(3);Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(4). Further, food purchases with food stamps or other supplemental food programs are also exempt from tax. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(6); Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(7); Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(9). Every January 1 and July 1, the Colorado Department of Revenue publishes a complete list of all state administered counties, cities, and special districts. This list includes all of the exemptions that each locality has opted into or out of, as well as whether the locality has elected to impose a use tax on the registration of motor vehicles and building materials. Form DR 1002 Colorado Sales/Use Tax Rates. Baseball Stadium District, Football Stadium District, Regional Transportation District, Scientific and Cultural Facilities District A Baseball Stadium District sales and use tax applies to sales and use of all tangible personal property and services that are subject to the Colorado state sales and use tax, so long as the sale or use occurs within a baseball stadium district. Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-13-107(1)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-15-110(1); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-14-114(1); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-9-119(2)(a). This tax applies to purchases of machinery or machine tools that would otherwise qualify for the manufacturing exemption, sales of low-emitting motor vehicles, power sources, or parts used for converting such power sources, and vending machine sales of food that are generally exempt from sales tax. Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-13-107(1)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-13-107(1)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-13-107(1)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-15-110(1)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-15-110(1)(b); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-15-110(1)(c); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-14-114(1)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-14-114(1)(b); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-14-114(1)(c); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-9-119(2)(a)(I); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-9-119(2)(a)(II); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-9-119(2)(a)(III). Additionally, sales and purchases of renewable energy, telephone services, gas, and electricity are subject to tax. Form DR 1002 Colorado Sales/Use Tax Rates. Taxable transactions are sourced to districts using the same sourcing method used to source the state sales and use tax. Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-13-107(1)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-15-110(1); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-14-114(1); Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-9-119(2)(a). Local Improvement District A Local Improvement District sales and use tax applies to any sale that would be subject to the state sales and use tax. Colo. Rev. Stat. §30-20-604.5(1); Form DR 1002 Colorado Sales/Use Tax Rates. This tax does not apply to sales of telephone and telegraph services nor to gas and electricity sales for residential and commercial use. Colo. Rev. Stat. §30-20-604.5(1); Form DR 1002 Colorado Sales/Use Tax Rates. However, a local improvement district is permitted to tax sales of low-emitting motor vehicles, power sources, or parts used for converting such power sources. Colo. Rev. Stat. §30-20-604.5(1); Form DR 1002 Colorado Sales/Use Tax Rates. Taxable transactions are sourced to the districts using the same sourcing method used to source the state sales and use tax. Colo. Rev. Stat. §30-20-604.5(1). Mass Transit District A Mass Transit District can consist of multiple jurisdictions within the state of Colorado, determining the amount of sales and use tax due on a transaction can be difficult. Items are subject to sales and use tax only if the jurisdiction in which it is being purchased, one of the localities making up the Mass Transit District, subjects the sale to tax. Thus, if the locality is a member of a Mass Transit District, the Mass Transit District sales and use tax only applies to those sales that the local level tax applies to. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-103.5(1)(a); Form DR 1002 Colorado Sales/Use Tax Rates; Colorado FYI Sales 62. However the use tax is only permitted to be imposed on motor vehicles registered within their borders as well as construction and building materials purchased or transported into the jurisdiction. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-109(1); Colorado FYI Sales 62. For example, of the allowed elective exemptions, Eagle County only exempts sales and purchases of gas and electricity for residential use; therefore, those same sales are exempt from the mass transit district tax. Form DR 1002 Colorado Sales/Use Tax Rates. Similarly, because local counties and incorporated cities and towns can only impose use tax on registration of motor vehicles and purchases of building materials that are transported into the county, mass transit district use tax can only apply to those same transactions. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-103.5(3); Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-103.5(4); see Form DR 1002 Colorado Sales/Use Tax Rates. Taxable transactions are sourced to the districts using the same sourcing method used to source the state sales and use tax. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-103.5(3). Multi-Jurisdictional Housing Authority A Multi-Jurisdictional Housing Authority sales and use tax applies to all sales that are subject to the state sales and use tax, with a few exceptions. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-1-204.5(3)(f.1)(I). However, the use tax is only permitted to be imposed on motor vehicles registered within their borders as well as construction and building materials purchased or transported into the jurisdiction. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-109(1); Colorado FYI Sales 62. This tax does not apply to telephone services, but does apply to gas and electricity. Form DR 1002 Colorado Sales/Use Tax Rates. A multi-jurisdictional housing authority exempts from its sales tax all available statutorily permissible exemptions for local jurisdictions. Form DR 1002 Colorado Sales/Use Tax Rates. Taxable transactions are sourced to the districts using the same sourcing method used to source the state sales and use tax. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-1-204.5(3)(f.1)(I). Rural Transportation Authority A Rural Transportation Authority sales and use tax applies to the same sales and purchases that the state sales and use tax applies to, with few exceptions. Colo. Rev. Stat. §43-4-605(1)(j)(I). This tax does not apply to sales of tangible personal property delivered to a location outside of the district. Colo. Rev. Stat. §43-4-605(1)(j)(I); Colo. Rev. Stat. §43-4-605(1)(j)(II)(A); Colo. Rev. Stat. §43-4-605(1)(j)(II)(B); Colo. Rev. Stat. §43-4-605(1)(j)(II)(C). Additionally, each rural transportation authority district has the option of selecting certain transactions to be exempt from sales or use tax. Colo. Rev. Stat. §43-4-605(1)(j)(I). Every district has elected to exempt all available authorized exemptions with the exemption of sales of telephone services and sales of gas and electricity for residential or commercial use. Form DR 1002 Colorado Sales/Use Tax Rates. Taxable transactions are sourced to the districts using the same sourcing method used to source the state sales and use tax. Colo. Rev. Stat. §43-4-605(1)(j)(I). Home Rule Jurisdictions Generally, the local home rule jurisdictions administer, collect, and enforce all sales and use taxes enacted by their statutory localities. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-106. Administration of these local taxes is to be in accordance with the state sales and use tax collection procedures. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-106(1). Since the home rule jurisdictions are self-governing, each individual locality generally defines what transactions are taxable and what exemptions will apply. A review of the top ten home rule municipalities by population was conducted to illustrate some similarities about what transactions are subject to tax and what types of exemptions that could apply. Cities reviewed included Aurora, Arvada, Boulder, Colorado Springs, Denver, Fort Collins, Lakewood, Pueblo, Thornton, and Westminster. Under local municipal statutes, sales tax applies to the retail sale of tangible personal property and services, that are not specifically exempt from such tax. Denver Rev. Muni. Code §53-25(1); Colorado Springs City Code §2.7.201;Aurora City Code §130-156(1); Lakewood Muni. Code §3-01-120(A); Ft. Collins Muni. Code §25-73(a);Arvada Code of Ordinance §98-66(1); Pueblo Muni. Code §14-4-61(1); Boulder Rev. Code §3-2-2(a); Thornton Code of Ordinance §26-389(a); Westminster Muni. Code §4-2-5(A). Additionally, sales of telecommunication and cable services, food and drink served or furnished in or by restaurants, as well as club cover charges are also subject to tax. Denver Rev. Muni. Code §53-25(3); Denver Rev. Muni. Code §53-25(5); Colorado Springs City Code §2.7.306;Aurora City Code §130-156(3); Aurora City Code §130-156(4);Aurora City Code §130-156(9); Lakewood Muni Code §3-01-120(C); Lakewood Muni Code §3-01-120(E); Ft.

Code §4-2-5(A)(2); Westminster Muni. Code §4-2-5(A)(6). Use tax applies to the purchase of tangible personal property and certain taxable services used, stored, distributed, or consumed within the taxing jurisdiction's borders that is not otherwise exempted under statute. Denver Rev. Muni. Code §53-25(1); Aurora City Code §130-196; Lakewood Muni. Code §3-01-120(A); Ft. Collins Muni. Code §25-74(a);Arvada Code of Ordinance §98-77; Pueblo Muni. Code §14-4-63(1); Boulder Rev. Code 3-2-2(a); Thornton Code of Ordinance §26-389(a); Westminster Muni. Code §4-2-5. All transactions exempt from sales tax are also exempt from use tax.

Code §4-2-6(A)(3). • sales and purchase of food; Denver Rev. Muni. Code §53-26(8); Colorado Springs City Code §2.7.415;Aurora City Code §130-157(7); Ft. Collins Muni. Code §25-73(d)(1); Pueblo Muni. Code §14-4-76(5). Arvada, Lakewood, Boulder, Thornton, Westminster do not exempt food and Ft. Collins applies a reduced sales tax rate on food sales. • sales and purchases of certain farm animals; Denver Rev. Muni. Code §53-26(5); Colorado Springs City Code §2.7.421;Aurora City Code §130-157(13); Lakewood Muni Code §3-01-180(23); Ft. Collins Muni. Code §25-73(c)(7); Pueblo Muni. Code §14-4-76(10); Boulder Rev.

Arvada does not exempt sales of farm animals. • sales and purchases of mares and stallions for breeding purposes; Denver Rev. Muni. Code §53-26(5); Colorado Springs City Code §2.7.421;Aurora City Code §130-157(13); Lakewood Muni Code §3-01-180(23); Ft. Collins Muni. Code §25-73(c)(7); Pueblo Muni. Code §14-4-76(10); Boulder Rev. Code 3-2-6(m); Thornton Code of Ordinance §26-390(a)(15)(c); Westminster Muni. Code §4-2-6(A)(12). Arvada does not exempt sales and purchases of mares and stallions for breeding purposes. • sales and purchases of feed for livestock or poultry, seeds, and orchard trees; Denver Rev. Muni. Code §53-26(6); Colorado Springs City Code §2.7.414;Aurora City Code §130-157(14); Lakewood Muni Code §3-01-180(24); Ft. Collins Muni. Code §25-73(c)(15); Pueblo Muni. Code §14-4-76(11); Thornton Code of Ordinance §26-390(a)(14)(e); Westminster Muni. Code §4-2-6(A)(13). Boulder and Arvada do not exempt sales and purchases of feed for livestock or poultry, seeds, and orchard trees. • sales and purchases of farm machinery; Denver Rev. Muni. Code §53-26(12); Aurora City Code §130-157(2); Ft. Collins Muni. Code §25-73(c)(14); Westminster Muni. Code §4-2-6(A)(11). Arvada, Boulder, Colorado Springs, Lakewood, Thornton, and Pueblo do not exempt sales and purchases of farm machinery. and • sales to public schools, religious and charitable organizations. Denver Rev. Muni. Code §53-26(2); Colorado Springs City Code §2.7.404;Colorado Springs City Code §2.7.437; Aurora City Code §130-157(11); Lakewood Muni Code §3-01-180(2); Lakewood Muni Code §3-01-180(8); Ft. Collins Muni. Code §25-73(c)(6);Arvada Code of Ordinance §98-70(2); Arvada Code of Ordinance §98-70(9)(f);Arvada Code of Ordinance §98-70(9)(n); Pueblo Muni. Code §14-4-76(8); Boulder Rev. Code 3-2-7(b); Thornton Code of Ordinance §26-390(a)(23). Although home rule jurisdictions generally govern what sales are subject to sales and use tax, Colorado state law imposes a few restrictions on the taxation of certain items. For example, if the home rule jurisdiction imposes a use tax, construction equipment located within the jurisdiction for a period of less than 30 days is subject to use tax based on the following calculation: purchase price of the equipment multiplied by one twelfth. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-109(3). Also, the jurisdiction must give purchasers of the construction equipment a tax credit for any sales tax already paid on the equipment. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-109(3). Further, the home rule jurisdictions may not tax property if it has been significantly used for its primary purpose within Colorado for at least three years from the date of sale. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-109(2). Similarly, purchases of construction and building materials as well as purchases of other tangible personal property or taxable services are not subject to local sales or use tax if the tax was previously paid in another Colorado taxing jurisdiction. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(2); Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(3); Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(4). Instead, the taxing jurisdiction must give a credit for the taxes paid up to the applicable tax due on the transaction in the taxing jurisdiction. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(3); Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(4). Likewise, food purchases with food stamps or other supplemental food programs are exempt from tax. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(6); Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(7); Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-105(9). BNA-SUTN CO 31.1.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Vendor/Seller Registration

Required All Colorado retailers, including out-of-state retailers who meet Colorado's economic nexus threshold, are required to obtain a license for each separate place of business. Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-103; 39 Colo. Code Regs. §26-204.2, as amended by Colo. Reg. Vol. 41, No. 19 (Oct. 10, 2018), effective Dec. 1, 2018, by Colo. Reg. Vol. 42, No. 2 (Jan. 25, 2019), effective Dec. 18, 2018, and by Colo. Reg. Vol. 42, No. 6 (March 25, 2019), effective April 14, 2019; Colorado FYI Sales 9. The cost for in-state retailers is $16 plus a $50 deposit that is credited against the sales tax to be remitted. Prior to Dec. 1, 2018, out-of-state sellers could apply for the license free of charge and could petition the Department to waive the deposit if the products are subject only to local taxes. Effective Dec. 1, 2018, the provision for free licenses for out-of-state sellers was repealed. Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-103; 39 Colo. Code Regs. §26-204.2, as amended by Colo. Reg. Vol. 41, No. 19 (Oct. 10, 2018), effective Dec. 1, 2018, by Colo. Reg. Vol. 42, No. 2 (Jan. 25, 2019), effective Dec. 18, 2018, and by Colo. Reg. Vol. 42, No. 6 (March 25, 2019), effective April 14, 2019. There are several types of licenses available for in-state and out-of-state retailers, depending on a retailer's sales types (wholesale or special event), how many business locations a retailer has and whether the retailer is a non-profit, religious or government organization. Colorado Dept. of Rev., Web Blog—Opening or Closing a Sales Tax Account. Licenses are valid for a two-year period ending on the last day of odd-numbered years. Beginning in June 2018, businesses are able to obtain sales tax licenses online at the mobile-friendly MyBizColorado website. Colorado Governor's Office, Press Release: MyBizColorado Website Provides Easier, Mobile-friendly Tool to Launch New Colorado Businesses (June 5, 2018). The application for a license includes the name and address of the applicant, the name of the business, the location of the business, and other information that the Department may require. Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-103(1). A retailer who violates any provision of the sales and use tax law may have their license revoked by the Executive Director. Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-103(4). Mobile vendors that sell tangible personal property from a vehicle must obtain a Colorado sales tax license for their main physical location. A mobile vendor must also report to the Colorado Department of Revenue any sales occurring at “non-physical sites"(i.e., locations other than the home office or business's registered physical address). Mobile vendors are responsible for collecting and remitting all local taxes for the areas in which they make sales. Colorado FYI Sales 9; Colorado FYI Sales 62. Individuals who make isolated or occasional sales from their homes are not required to obtain a license if they make total sales of less than $1,000 per year; however they are still required to collect and remit sales tax. Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-103(9)(d); Colorado FYI Sales 9. A sales tax license is required to sell medical and recreational marijuana. If a vendor sells both medical and recreational marijuana, two sales tax licenses are required. Colorado FYI Sales 93. Registration Requirements for Specified Transaction Types Contractors Contractors are required to have a sales and use tax license if they, at times, bill on a time-and-material basis, as they are required to collect and remit sales tax in time-and-material contracts. 39 Colo. Code Regs. §26-SR-10(3); Colorado General Information Letter GIL-15-015 (June 8, 2015). Special Sales Events A special sales event is an event that does not occur more than three times a calendar year in which more than three persons make retails sales at a place other than their normal business location. Sellers that conduct sales at more than one special sales event in any two-year period may apply for the special sales event license along with a $16 fee. Moreover, the event organizer of the special sales event may apply for the license and have the responsibility to remit the tax collected from persons making retail sales at the event. Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-103(9)(b.5). The Colorado Department of Revenue provides a free service through Revenue Online where a vendor who participates in special events can obtain a license for the event and file the sales taxes collected at the event all at the same time. Revenue Online contains sales tax returns for most major events held throughout Colorado. Each return is tailored to an event location and will calculate the appropriate state-collected sales tax and the state sales tax license fee. Colorado Dept. of Rev., Tax Update - Sales Tax License for Special Events (Nov. 2, 2017); Colorado Dept. of Rev., Holiday Fairs and Bazaars – Getting a Sales Tax License/Filing through Revenue Online. Sales at Farmers Markets Colorado does not require a person to obtain a sales tax license if the person exclusively sells commodities at farmers' markets (e.g., vegetables, fruit, or rice for home consumption). However, if a farmer or retailer at a farmers'market sells prepared food or other tangible personal property, then the person must have a Colorado sales tax license. Additionally, if the farmers’ market occurs in a jurisdiction that taxes food for home consumption, then farmers or retailers must collect and pay local tax either on their own sales tax license account or through the market organizer account as necessary. If the organizer collects local sales tax only because state sales tax is not required, then the organizer can request to not pay the $50 state sales tax deposit that the Colorado Department of Revenue normally requires for obtaining a retail sales tax license. See, e.g., Colorado Dept. of Rev., Web Blog – Vendors at Farmers' Markets (May 17, 2016);Colorado Dept. of Rev., Web Blog – Farmers' Markets (June 11, 2014). Home Rule Jurisdictions Generally, the local home rule jurisdictions administer, collect, and enforce all sales and use taxes enacted by their statutory localities. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-106. Administration of these local taxes is to be in accordance with the state sales and use tax collection procedures. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-106(1). However, the Colorado Department of Revenue is permitted to administer, collect, and distribute the local sales and use tax upon the request of the home rule locality if the home rule locality's sales and use tax ordinances meet two requirements. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-106(4)(a)(I). First, the sales tax ordinance of the home rule jurisdiction must conform to the same rules as the statutory localities. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-106(4)(a)(I)(A). Second, the use tax ordinance must only apply to the same transactions as the state use tax law. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-106(4)(a)(I)(B). Currently, the Department of Revenue collects all the sales and use tax for the city of Westminster, a home rule city. If the home rule locality makes such a request, the Department of Revenue may not charge for the services of administrating, collecting, and distributing these taxes. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-106(4)(a). Additionally, while local home rule municipalities may enact their own local tax statutes, their collection procedures still must conform to certain state procedures. These procedures include the statute of limitations applicable to the enforcement of state sales and use tax collections, the statute of limitations applicable to refunds of state sales and use taxes, the amount of penalties and interest payable on delinquent remittances of state sales and use taxes, and the posting of bonds. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-106(8). Vendors are generally required to collect and remit the local sales tax and report it using a municipal sales tax form. Denver Rev. Muni. Code §53-28(a); Colorado Springs City Code §2.7.602;Aurora City Code §130-160(a); Lakewood Muni Code §3-01-130(A); Ft. Collins Muni. Code §25-123;Arvada Code of Ordinance §98-67; Pueblo Muni. Code §14-4-86; Boulder Rev. Code 3-2-4; Thornton Code of Ordinance §26-391(d); Westminster Muni. Code §4-2-3(C); Westminster Muni. Code §4-1-5. Refer to the local home rule jurisdictions for the appropriate sales tax return for that locality. Some home rule municipalities permit vendors collecting and remitting these taxes on time to retain of a portion of the taxes due as a service fee to cover the vendor's expense of collecting and remitting the local sales and use tax to the local home rule jurisdiction. Colorado Springs City Code §2.7.804;Aurora City Code §130-160(b); Arvada Code of Ordinance §98-68;Thornton Code of Ordinance §26-391(d)(3). Denver, Boulder, Ft. Collins, Lakewood, and Pueblo do not have a vendor discount fee. Colorado Springs has a vendor discount fee beginning for returns filed after April 1, 2012; see Form DR 1002 Colorado Sales/Use Tax Rates for a complete listing of home rule jurisdictions that provide a vendor discount fee. The vendor fee varies between each home rule municipality, but ranges between zero percent and 3.333 percent. For a complete listing of home rule jurisdictions and their vendor discount rates, see Form DR 1002 Colorado Sales/Use Tax Rates. Direct payment permits procedures are also governed by local law.

Basis for Remittance Colorado requires vendors to charge consumers or users the applicable sales or use tax on purchases made at retail. Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-106(2)(a). However, vendors remain liable for payment of taxes on all sales and certain services specified in Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-104. Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-105. Thus, the basis for tax that must be paid by a vendor is, “gross taxable sales,” defined as the total amount received in money, credits, or property, and other consideration valued in money from sales and purchases at retail.

Business Successor Liability In Colorado, purchasers of a business are responsible for unpaid sale or use tax. The successor in business is required to withhold from the purchase price the amount of tax that may be due until the seller provides the buyer with a receipt stating no tax is due. The purchaser, along with the former owner, will become personally liable for tax owed if the buyer does not withhold the amount from the purchase price and the taxes remain unpaid after the 10-day period the former owner has to file a final return. 39 Colo.

3.33% Colorado law provides for a vendors fee or allowance to vendors who timely file complete reports and remit the full tax, which may be retained from sales tax due for a filing period. Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-105(1). The vendor's fee is intended to cover the vendor's expense of tax collection, and is conditioned on a timely filing of a complete tax return, all required schedules, and the full remittance of tax due. Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-105(1); 39 Colo. Code Regs. §26-105(3), as amended by Colo. Reg. Vol. 41, No. 19 (Oct. 10, 2018), effective Dec. 1, 2018, by Colo. Reg.

The change is effective for state sales tax, state retailer's use tax, aviation sales tax and RTD/CD special district tax. From July 1, 2011, and continuing through July 1, 2014, vendors were allowed to retain an amount to cover expenses of collecting and remitting tax, but the amount was limited to 2.22 percent of all sales tax reported on the tax return. Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-105(1)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-105(1)(g). For sales occurring prior to July 1, 2003, the general allowance for vendors was 3.33 percent of the sum remitted, 2.33 percent for sales occurring after July 1, 2003, but before July 1, 2005, and 3.33 percent for sales occurring on or after July 1, 2005. However, the general allowance rate of 3.33 percent for sales occurring after July 1, 2005, has been limited for certain periods of time, reducing the rate of the allowance or disallowing it entirely. Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-105(1)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-105(1)(f). For sales occurring on or after March 1, 2009, but prior to July 1, 2009, the allowance was limited to 1.35 percent of all sales tax reported for a vendor that was not allowed to file on a basis less frequent than monthly. For sales made on or after July 1, 2009, but prior to June 30, 2011, vendors were not allowed to retain any amount to cover the vendor's expense in collecting and remitting tax. Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-105(1)(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. §39-26-105(1)(f). Had the September 2010 forecast prepared by the state legislature indicated sufficient revenues to fully fund a 6 percent increase in general funding for the 2010-11 fiscal year, a vendor discount would have been reinstated for periods commencing on or after Jan. 1, 2011.

Code Regs. § SR-1(1)(a)(iii), effective June 21, 2018. Taxpayers with a current sales tax account that fail to file a return will receive a Nonfiler Notification letter. Once a taxpayer receives such notification, they should expect to receive a separate bill once the department has estimated the amount of tax owed for the delinquent period. Taxpayers failing to respond to the bill will receive a “Warrant of Distraint,” which gives the department the authority to seize a business and sell its assets to satisfy tax debts. Businesses that were closed during a delinquent period must write the date of closure on the letter and send it back to the department to have the sales tax account closed. In addition, businesses with a Colorado sales tax account are required to file a return even when there were no taxable sales during the filing period.

Fraudulent Returns Taxpayers who intentionally attempt to defraud the Colorado Department of Revenue will receive a penalty of 100 percent of the total amount of the deficiency when added to the tax amount due and the whole amount of the unpaid tax. The penalty is payable 10 days after written notice of demand from the Executive Director. A felony is also committed by persons who willfully refuse to file, file a false or fraudulent return, make a false statement on the turn, or fail to remit collected taxes. Colo. Rev.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Amnesty Programs 2011

Yes Colorado authorized a tax amnesty program for 2011 which was conducted from Oct. 1, 2011, through Nov. 15, 2011. Colo. Rev Stat. §39-21-201. A taxpayer eligible to participate in the tax amnesty program included any taxpayer liable for the payment of corporate income taxes. The Colorado tax amnesty program permitted any taxpayer liable for payment of taxes to report the amount of the taxes for which the taxpayer was liable and to pay the full amount of such taxes, including one-half of any interest due, on or before Nov. 15, 2011, without the imposition of any fine or other civil or criminal penalty otherwise provided by law. Colo. Rev Stat. §39-21-201(3). An agreement to pay must have been printed on the tax amnesty application form and the taxpayer must have delivered the application and signed agreement to pay to the Colorado Department of Revenue on or before Nov. 15, 2011, to avoid the imposition of any fine or other civil or criminal penalty otherwise provided by law. If the taxpayer failed to pay the full amount of taxes owed and all interest for which the taxpayer was liable under the terms of the tax amnesty agreement to pay, the waiver was void. Colo. Rev Stat. §39-21-201. Payment of taxes under this program constituted a waiver of any right to file a claim for refund or an amended return for refund, or seek an administrative review, administrative hearing, or district court appeal. If a taxpayer failed to pay the full amount of the tax liability by Nov. 15, 2011, or failed to sign and file the agreement to pay on the tax amnesty application by Nov. 15, 2011, and remained in compliance with the agreement to pay, or committed willful fraud in filing pursuant to the terms of the tax amnesty program, the taxpayer was subject to civil or criminal penalty, or both. Colo. Rev Stat. §39-21-201(3). A taxpayer liable for the payment of any taxes was not be permitted to satisfy the liability through the tax amnesty program if a notice of deficiency for the liability had been mailed to the taxpayer before Oct. 1, 2011. A taxpayer who was under investigation or was being prosecuted for criminal or fraudulent activity as of Oct. 1, 2011, for crimes related to any taxes collected by the department was not eligible to participate in the tax amnesty program, regardless of whether the taxes owed for which the taxpayer seeks amnesty were the taxes on which the investigation or prosecution was based. Colo. Rev Stat. §39-21-201(4). The department was authorized, at the discretion of the executive director, to accept department approved credit card payments for all payments due and assess the taxpayer an amount equivalent to any service fee charged by the credit card company to the department. Such an amount was collected by the department and used by the department for the purpose of paying the credit card fees. Colo. Rev Stat. §39-21-201(5). The department may have contracted with one or more independent contractors to administer any part of the tax amnesty program on behalf of the department. Colo. Rev Stat. §39-21-201(6.5). Denver Amnesty Program The city and county of Denver, Colorado, established a tax amnesty program for sales, use and occupational privilege taxes incurring on or before June 30, 2011, to run from Oct. 1, 2011, through Dec. 30, 2011. Denver Tax Amnesty Guidelines (Draft). The program allowed taxpayers to pay any unreported back taxes while avoiding penalties and criminal prosecution. Interest charges on any delinquent taxes were reduced by half. Denver Tax Amnesty Guidelines (Draft). Property taxes were not eligible for the amnesty program. Denver Tax Amnesty Guidelines (Draft). To obtain the benefits offered under the amnesty program, a check for the full payment of taxes and the reduced interest amount must have accompanied the application for amnesty. The application and payment must have been received or postmarked by the final day amnesty was offered, Dec. 30, 2011. Denver Tax Amnesty Guidelines (Draft). For periods in which the taxpayer applied for amnesty, the taxpayer waived its right to future claims for any refund, credits, or appeal. If the taxpayer applied for amnesty and was denied, Denver applied the payment received to any outstanding tax liabilities the taxpayer may have had and would not refund the payment. If amnesty was granted and an audit later revealed additional taxes were due, amnesty that was granted would not be revoked for the amount that the taxpayer had self-assessed, but the additional tax due from an audit assessment would be subject to full penalty and interest charges. However, if the taxpayer knowingly filed a false amnesty application form for a taxable period, amnesty would be revoked and full penalty and interest charges would be reinstated. Denver Tax Amnesty Guidelines (Draft). Most businesses and individuals were eligible for the amnesty program if they:• previously failed to file a return or underreported the tax on a previously filed return for Denver sales tax, use tax, or occupational privilege tax for any taxable period ending on or before June 30, 2011; • purchased goods for consumption in Denver from vendors that did not charge Denver sales tax. This included untaxed purchases over the internet; • made a one-time or occasional sale in Denver and did not collect or remit Denver sales tax; or • purchased or entered into a motor vehicle lease on or before June 30, 2011, resided in Denver at the time and either did not pay local tax on the transaction, or improperly reported residency in another city or county. Denver Tax Amnesty Guidelines (Draft). Taxes other than Denver sales, use, or occupational privilege taxes are not eligible for amnesty under the Denver program. Furthermore, tax periods ineligible for amnesty included those in which the taxpayer:• incurred the tax liability after June 30, 2011; • had been issued a notice of delinquency, underpayment, or a final determination and demand for payment prior to filing for amnesty; • had entered into a written payment agreement for taxes due prior to Oct. 1, 2011; or • was under investigation or prosecution for criminal or fraudulent activity related to Denver taxes as of Oct. 1, 2011.
