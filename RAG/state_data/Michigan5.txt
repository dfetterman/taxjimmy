Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal General Rule for Classification

Three-part Test In Sequist v. Fabiano, the Michigan Supreme Court established a three-prong test used to determine whether and when tangible personal property becomes sufficiently affixed to real property that it should be treated as a fixture. See Sequist v. Fabiano, 265 N.W. 488 (Mich. 1936); see also Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2016-4 (Feb. 1, 2016) (describing in detail Michigan's case law regarding fixtures). The test's three prongs are:• annexation of the tangible personal property to the real property, either actually or constructively; • adaptation or application of the item to the use or purpose of the part of the real property to which it is connected; and • intention to make the item a permanent accession to the real estate. Sequist v. Fabiano, 265 N.W. 488 (Mich. 1936); see also Wayne County, Mich. v. Britton Trust, 563 N.W.2d 674 (Mich. 1997) (citing Morris v. Alexander, 175 N.W. 264 (Mich. 1919)); Michigan Administrative Decision 244224 (June 24, 1994); Brunt Assocs. v. Michigan Dept. of Treas., 2017 BL 835 (Mich. Ct. App. 2017); Michigan Treasury Update --March 2017. Annexation Actual annexation occurs when an object is physically affixed to real property. Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2016-4 (Feb. 1, 2016). Furthermore, even if an object is not physically affixed, it can become a fixture via “constructive annexation.”Constructive annexation “has frequently been applied in the case of articles which are not themselves actually or directly annexed to the realty, but are part of, or accessory to, articles which are so annexed. Thus, where the principal part of machinery is [a] fixture due to actual annexation to the realty, the parts of it, although not actually annexed to the freehold, are fixture[s] where they would, if removed, leave the principal part unfit for use, and where of themselves they are not capable of general use elsewhere.” Sequist v. Fabiano (Mich. 1936); see also Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2016-4 (Feb. 1, 2016). Adaptation or Application Adaptation or application refers to the “relationship between chattel and the use which is made of the realty to which the chattel is annexed. . . . [A]n object introduced onto the realty may become a fixture if it is a necessary or at least a useful adjunct to the realty, considering the purpose to which the latter is devoted.” Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2016-4 (Feb. 1, 2016), quoting Wayne County, Mich. v. Britton Trust (Mich. 1997). The Michigan Department of Revenue explains that if an item functions as part of the particular building or if it carries out part of the function of real property, then that item will likely constitute real property. Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2016-4 (Feb. 1, 2016). Property that has been adapted to the use or purpose of the real estate includes screens that are built to fit the windows of a particular building, drive-up window equipment, vault doors, and theatre seats bolted to the floor of a theatre. Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2016-4 (Feb. 1, 2016); see also Michigan Administrative Decision 429973 (May 10, 2013). Intention to Make Permanent In Michigan, the parties' intentions largely determine whether an article attached to real estate becomes a fixture. Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2016-4 (Feb. 1, 2016) (citing Morris v. Alexander, 175 N.W. 264 (Mich. 1919)). Michigan guidance explains that the “objective, visible facts” (i.e., the surrounding circumstances)manifest the parties' intentions, not the “annexor's secret subjective intent.” Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2016-4 (Feb. 1, 2016), citing Mich. Natl. Bank, Lansing v. Lansing, Mich., 293 N.W.2d 626, 96 Mich. App. 551, 96 Mich. App. 551 (1980), 293 N.W.2d 626 (Mich. Ct. App. 1980). Further, the guidance distinguishes permanency from perpetuity, explaining that for an article to become a fixture, the parties need not intend to make the structure last forever. Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2016-4 (Feb. 1, 2016), citing Tuinier v. Charter Twp. of Bedford, 599 N.W.2d 116, 235 Mich. App. 663, 671-72 (Mich. Ct. App. 1999). The department characterizes as “personal property” any:• portable air compressor; • freestanding appliance; • window unit air conditioner; • ductwork for equipment; • generator used for specific equipment; or • plumbing for specific equipment. Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2016-4 (Feb. 1, 2016). In contrast, the department characterizes as “real property” any:• air compressor for a central building system; • awning; • built-in appliance; • central air conditioning system for a building; • building or home cabinet; • carpeting; • ductwork for a building; • elevator; • fire protection sprinkler for a building; • generator that services a building; • hot water heater; • plumbing for a building;or • floor-bolted theater seat. Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2016-4 (Feb. 1, 2016). Furthermore, the Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2016-4 summarizes Michigan court or Tax Tribunal decisions that apply the three-part test. Those examples show that under the particular facts and circumstances of the cases, at least one Michigan court or Tax Tribunal has identified as a fixture a greenhouse, grain storage bin, or wooden pole-mounted outdoor warning siren. In contrast, at least one Michigan court or Tax Tribunal has identified as tangible personal property a modular home or a methane-producing landfill cell. See Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2016-4 (Feb. 1, 2016), citing Tuinier v. Charter Twp. of Bedford, 599 N.W.2d 116, 235 Mich App 663, 671–72 (Mich. Ct. App. 1999) (greenhouses); Miedma Metal Bldg. Sys., Inc. v. Michigan Dept. of Treas., 338 N.W.2d 924, 127 Mich App 533 (Mich. Ct.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Contractor Classifications

Depends Michigan's sales and use tax treatment of construction services and tangible personal property used in rendering those services varies depending upon whether the contractor is treated as a retailer or a manufacturer. Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2016-18 (Sept. 20, 2016). Contractors Engaged in the Business of Selling Tangible Personal Property at Retail Contractors may be engaged in the business of making sales of tangible personal property at retail, as well as in the business of altering, constructing, repairing, or improving real property for others. A contractor may make sales at retail when the contractor sells supplies to another contractor to complete a construction contract, or when the contractor sells tangible personal property in the course of performing a construction contract and the property is not consumed or affixed to the real property. Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2016–18 (Sept. 20, 2016). A contractor who is engaged in the business of making retail sales is required to be licensed as a retailer under sales and use tax law. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.95(1); Mich. Comp. Laws §205.53(1); Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2016–18 (Sept. 20, 2016). A contractor engaged in the business of being a retailer is entitled to purchase materials exempt from sales tax as sales for resale. However, when a contractor-retailer withdraws tangible personal property purchased free from tax from inventory, the contractor is responsible for paying use tax on the value of the property removed. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.51a(r); Mich. Comp. Laws §205.52(1); Mich. Comp. Laws §205.92(k); Mich. Comp. Laws §205.93(1); Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2016–18 (Sept. 20, 2016). Manufacturer-Contractors For a manufacturer-contractor who either maintains an inventory of its product that is available for sale to others or makes its product available for sale to others by publication or price list, and affixes that product to real estate located in Michigan, the use tax base is the direct production costs and the indirect production costs of the product that are incident to and necessary for production or manufacturing. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.93a(1)(f); Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2016–24. This is referred to as the “finished goods inventory value”of the product. Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2016–24. The “finished goods inventory value”is calculated according to the full absorption method of inventory valuation for manufacturers as described in 26 CFR 1.471-11. Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2016–24. For a manufacturer-contractor who does not maintain an inventory of its product available for sale to others or make its product available for sale to others by publication or price list, and affixes that product to real estate located in Michigan, the use tax base is the sum of the materials, cost of the property, and the cost of labor to manufacture, fabricate, or assemble the property affixed to the real estate in the state, but excluding the cost of labor to cut, bend, assemble, or attach the property at the site for affixation to real estate in Michigan.

Defined The term “contractor” includes subcontractors directly engaged in the business of constructing, altering, repairing, or improving real estate for others. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.71(1). Subcontractors are treated as the consumer of the materials they use and are subject taxation;thus, subcontractors will receive the same sales and use tax treatment as contractors. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.52; Mich. Comp. Laws §205.93; Mich. Comp. Laws §205.71(2); Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2016–18 (Sept. 20, 2016). BNA-SUTN MI 28.6.

==================================================

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Contracts with Exempt Entities

Depends Contractors generally may not claim an exempt entity contractee's exemption for purchases of tangible personal property that they will install as fixtures to real property.

Taxable Mobile and manufactured homes are not specifically exempted from sales and use tax, thus it is presumed that they are subject to tax. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.51a(r); Mich. Comp. Laws §205.52(1); Mich. Comp. Laws §205.92(k); Mich. Comp. Laws §205.93(1). Sales tax is due on mobile homes in the same manner as prescribed for motor vehicles and must be paid to the Secretary of State. Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 1991-20 (Nov. 27, 1991). Tax Base Michigan's Equalization Act imposes tax on the sale or transfer of any manufactured home (as well as vehicle, ORV, aircraft, snowmobile, or watercraft) based on the retail dollar value of the property at the time of acquisition, rather than the purchase price. To the extent that the purchase price is less than the retail dollar value of the property, equalization tax is imposed on the difference. The department of revenue determines the “retail dollar value”using the National Auto Dealers Association (NADA) valuation guide. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.179; Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2017-26 (Dec. 15, 2017).
