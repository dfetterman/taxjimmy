Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Leases and Rentals

Depends The first payment on the lease or rental of taxable property is sourced to the location determined under the general rules, just like a retail sale. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.69(2)(b). Subsequent periodic payments on the lease or rental, if any, are sourced to the property's primary location as indicated by an address that is provided by the lessee and that is available in records that the lessor maintains in the ordinary course of business. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.69(2)(b). If a lessor purchases property outside of Michigan for purposes of leasing the property in Michigan, the lessor must pay use tax on the property at the time it is leased in Michigan. NACG Leasing LLC v. Michigan Dept. of Treas., No. 146234, 2014 BL 36494 (Mich. 2014) (a taxpayer was subject to use tax when it purchased an aircraft from out an out-of-state seller, and simultaneously leased the aircraft to a related entity that had possession of the aircraft in Michigan at the time of the transfer. The Michigan Supreme Court ruled that the taxpayer “used” the aircraft, because in leasing the aircraft, the taxpayer exercised a right incident to ownership in Michigan); Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2015-25 (Dec. 2, 2015). Motor Vehicle, Trailers, Semitrailers, and Aircraft Sourcing The sourcing for the lease or rental of motor vehicles, trailers, semitrailers, or aircraft that are not transportation equipment is as follows: • For a lease or rental requiring recurring periodic payments, each payment is sourced to the primary property location as indicated by the address of the property provided by the lessee and available to the lessor through the lessor's records maintained in the ordinary course of business. For sourcing purposes, the location is not considered altered by the intermittent use at a different location. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.69(3)(a). • For a lease or rental not requiring recurring periodic payments, the payment is sourced in the same manner as a retail sale, which has the same sourcing rules for the lease or rental of transportation equipment. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.69(3)(b); Mich. Comp. Laws §205.69(1). Transportation Equipment Sourcing Transportation equipment means: • locomotives and railcars utilized for the carriage of persons or property in interstate commerce; • trucks and truck-tractors with a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,001 pounds or greater, trailers, semitrailers, or passenger buses, which are registered through the international registration plan and operated under authority of a carrier authorized and certificated by the United States department of transportation or another federal authority to engage in the carriage of persons or property in interstate commerce; • aircraft operated by air carriers authorized and certificated by the United States department of transportation or other federal or foreign authority to transport air cargo or passengers in interstate or foreign commerce;and • containers designed for use on or component parts attached or secured to the above-described equipment. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.69(6). The lease or rental of transportation equipment is sourced under the following rules:• If the motor vehicle is received by the lessee at a business location of the lessor, the lease or rental is sourced to that business location. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.69(4); Mich. Comp. Laws §205.69(1)(a). • If the motor vehicle is not received by the lessee at a business location of the lessor, the lease or rental is sourced to the location where the motor vehicle is received by the lessee or the lessee's designee. This would include the location indicated by delivery instructions that are known to the lessor. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.69(4); Mich. Comp. Laws §205.69(1)(b). • If the above sourcing rules do not apply, the lease or rental is sourced to the address for the lessee that is available from the lessor's business records maintained in the ordinary course of business. The lease will be sourced under this rule as long as the use of the address does not constitute bad faith. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.69(4); Mich. Comp. Laws §205.69(1)(c). • In the event that the previously mentioned rules do not apply, the lease or rental is sourced to the address for the purchaser obtained at the completion of the transaction. This includes the address of the lessee's payment instrument if no other address is available, provided use of the address does not constitute bad faith. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.69(4); Mich. Comp. Laws §205.69(1)(d). • If none of the rules above apply, the lease or rental is sourced to the address from which the transportation equipment was shipped. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.69(4); Mich. Comp. Laws §205.69(1)(e). BNA-SUTN MI 4.1.3.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Credit for Tax Paid to Another Jurisdiction

Yes Michigan allows a reciprocal use tax credit up to the amount of any sales or use tax paid to another state. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.94(1)(e). If property was previously subject to sales or use tax in another state, and the tax was paid, Michigan use tax will not apply provided that the tax due is equal to or less than what was already paid in the other jurisdiction. If the Michigan use tax rate is higher than the rate imposed in the other jurisdiction, Michigan use tax is due based on the difference of what was previously paid under the other jurisdiction's rate. For this credit to be extended, the other jurisdiction must allow a similar credit for tax paid in Michigan. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.94(1)(e). BNA-SUTN MI 4.2.
