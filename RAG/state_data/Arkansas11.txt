Municipal Taxes Municipal Sales and Use Tax for Capital Improvements The state of Arkansas authorizes cities to impose a sales and use tax used to fund public capital improvements at a rate of 0.25 percent, 0.5 percent, 0.75 percent, or 1 percent and is collected by the state. Ark. Code Ann. §26-75-207(a)(1); Ark. Code Ann. §26-75-214(a). Any city sales and use tax imposed in order to fund public capital improvements is applied in the same manner and to the same items or services as the state sales and compensating use tax. Ark. Code Ann. §26-75-207(e). This tax may be adopted by ordinance or voter petition, signed by a number of voters that is equal to at least 15 percent of the number of votes in the last county clerk election, and requires approval by a majority of voters. Ark. Code Ann. §26-75-207(a)(2); Ark. Code Ann. §26-75-207(b)(1); Ark. Code Ann. §26-75-207(b)(2). The county quorum court of the jurisdiction imposing the tax may not unilaterally appropriate funds in a way that would restrict the use of the funds past the current fiscal year. Arkansas Atty. Gen. Op. 2014-077 (Oct. 9, 2014). Municipal Sales Tax for Capital Improvements Arkansas law authorizes any first or second class city and any incorporated town to impose a local sales or gross receipts and use tax in the amount of 0.125 percent, 0.25 percent, 0.5 percent, 0.75 percent, 1 percent, or any combination of these amounts.

Code Ann. §26-75-301(a); Ark. Code Ann. §26-75-303(4)(A). The county quorum court of the jurisdiction imposing the tax may not unilaterally appropriate funds in a way that would restrict the use of the funds past the current fiscal year. Arkansas Atty. Gen. Op. 2014-077 (Oct. 9, 2014). Additionally, a city or town with 3,000 or fewer inhabitants (according to the federal census)located in a county bordering another state, that also contains a historic district included in the National Registry of Historic Places, and that has been certified by the state Parks, Recreation, and Travel Commission as having tourism as the primary industry may enact a sales and use tax of the same rates in order to fund bonds financing public capital improvements. Ark. Code Ann. §26-75-301(a); Ark. Code Ann. §26-75-303(4)(B)(i); Ark. Code Ann. §26-75-307(a)(1). Temporary Tax Funding Parks Subject to approval by a majority of voters, a city may enact a sales and use tax for a maximum of two years at a rate of 0.5 percent or 1 percent in order to fund the acquisition, construction, or improvement of parks and recreation facilities within the municipality. Ark. Code Ann. §26-75-403(a); Ark. Code Ann. §26-75-408(a). A temporary sales and use tax funding parks is applied in the same manner as the state sales and use tax. Once collected, the Director of the Department of Finance deposits all revenue raised through the temporary tax for the funding of parks with the state treasurer. Ark. Code Ann. §26-75-407(a). All funds due to the city or town imposing the tax will be deposited by the state treasurer into the city or town treasury. Funds collected under this tax must be used to fund the acquisition, construction, or improvement of parks and recreation facilities within the municipality. Ark. Code Ann. §26-75-407. Any funds remaining after acquisition, construction, or improvement of the parks must be used to maintain and repair the parks built, improved, or acquired using this tax. Ark. Code Ann. §26-75-408(b). Additional Gross Receipts Tax Arkansas authorizes cities whose population is 40,000 or less to impose an additional one percent gross proceeds or gross receipts tax. Ark. Code Ann. §26-75-502(a). Cities that adopt the additional gross receipts tax must also impose a corresponding use tax at the same rate. Ark. Code Ann. §26-75-508(a); Ark. Code Ann. §26-75-508(b). The additional city gross receipts tax and corresponding use tax are applied in the same manner and on the same items and services as the state sales and corresponding use tax. Ark. Code Ann. §26-75-502(a). The additional gross proceeds or gross receipts tax must be subject to voter approval. Ark. Code Ann. §26-75-502(d); Ark. Code Ann. §26-75-503(a); Ark. Code Ann. §26-75-503(c). Local Sales and Use Tax to Retire Capital Improvement Bonds for Cities and Counties Arkansas authorizes municipalities to enact one of two statutes to impose local sales and use taxes in order to retire capital improvement bonds. Ark. Code Ann. §14-164-327(a)(1); Ark. Code Ann. §26-73-113(a)(1)(A). The first statute authorizes the governing body of any municipality or county, in lieu of an ad valorem tax, to impose sales and use tax if approved by a majority of the voters. Ark. Code Ann. §14-164-328(a)(2)(A). This tax may be imposed at a rate of 0.125 percent, 0.25 percent, 0.5 percent, 0.75 percent, 1 percent, or any combination of these amounts. Ark. Code Ann. §14-164-327(a)(1). The tax applies to the same base as the state sales and use tax and is in addition to all other taxes. Ark. Code Ann. §14-164-333(b)(1)(A); Ark. Code Ann. §14-164-333(d). The revenue from this tax must be used to retire bonds for capital improvements. Ark. Code Ann. §14-164-327(a)(1). In lieu of levying a sales and use tax for the sole purpose of paying bonded debt, the governing body of any municipality or county may enact an alternative sales and use tax of 0.25 percent, 0.5 percent, 0.75 percent, or 1 percent for one or more of the following:• financing a solid waste management systems operation, maintenance, or rental expenses; • securing the repayment of bonds by the municipality or county issued; or • acquiring or constructing capital improvements of a public nature for no more than 24 months. Ark. Code Ann. §26-73-113(a)(2)(A); Ark. Code Ann. §26-73-113(a)(2)(B); Ark. Code Ann. §26-73-113(a)(2)(C). The alternative sales and use tax applies to all taxable sales of property and services subject to the state sales tax, and upon the privilege of storing, using, distributing, or consuming within this state any tangible personal property which is subject to the state compensating use tax. Ark. Code Ann. §26-73-113(a)(1)(A). The ordinance imposing the tax must specify that the tax is being levied under Ark. Code Ann. §26-73-113. Ark. Code Ann. §26-73-113(c)(2)(A). Border Cities Border cities are authorized by statute to vote to equalize tax rates with a border city in an adjoining state. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-303(a). Upon approval of this ordinance, residents of the border city will pay an additional one percent to be administered and collected as a local sales tax on the gross receipts from taxable sales within the border city in lieu of the state income tax. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-303(a)(4); Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-605(a). A corresponding use tax of one percent is also imposed when the border city adopts an additional one percent sales tax in lieu of the state income tax. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-607. As long as the additional one percent tax is levied in the city, individuals who are residents of the city are not subject to the state income tax. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-606(a)(2). A “border city” is defined as an Arkansas city or incorporated town that is divided by a state line from an incorporated city or town in an adjoining state. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-303(a)(1). The city or town in the adjoining state must have a greater population than the Arkansas city or town and the tax imposed in the adjoining state must be a sales tax. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-303(a)(2). Special Local Sales and Use Tax for Counties and Cities Arkansas law authorizes any county, first class city, second class city, or incorporated town to adopt a special local sales and use tax ordinance. Ark. Code Ann. §26-73-110(a). Any county, first class city, second class city, or incorporated town that adopts a special local sales or use tax ordinance may do so for the use of the county, city, or town in an amount not to exceed 0.25 percent. Ark. Code Ann. §26-73-110(a). No city or town may levy this tax until the quorum court of the county where the city or town is located fails to pass an ordinance levying this tax at the county level. Nor may a city or town impose this tax until the quorum court of the county where the city or town is located passes an ordinance imposing this tax, which ordinance is denied by a majority vote of the registered voters within the county. Thus, no city or town may impose the special local sales and use tax until it has failed to be imposed at the county level. Ark. Code Ann. §26-73-110(a). This tax is imposed in addition to all other applicable state and local sales and use taxes. Ark. Code Ann. §26-73-112(a). A city county or town that adopts a special sales and use tax ordinance must provide for a special election subjecting the ordinance to voter approval. Ark. Code Ann. §26-73-111. The special local sales and use tax applies in addition to all other sales and use taxes authorized for counties, first class cities, second class cities, and incorporated towns. Ark. Code Ann. §26-73-112(a). Local Sales and Use Tax for Economic Development Projects A city or county has the authority to levy a local sales and use tax in the amount of 0.125 percent, 0.25 percent, 0.5 percent, 0.75 percent, 1 percent, or any combination of these amounts to pay project costs of an economic development project located within the levying entity or near the levying entity if still located within the state. Multiple taxes may be levied under this authority, but the aggregate rate of taxes levied under this authority must not exceed 1 percent. Ark. Code Ann. §26-82-103(2)(B). County Judicial Districts Generally Ten counties in Arkansas are divided into two or more judicial districts, each with jurisdiction only within that judicial district, rather than throughout the county:• Arkansas County is divided into the Northern District and the Southern District; Ark. Code Ann. §16-17-904(a). • Carroll County is divided into the Western District and the Eastern District; Ark. Code Ann. §16-17-931(a). • Franklin County is divided into the Charleston District and the Ozark District; Ark. Code Ann. §16-17-933(a). • Logan County is divided into the Northern District and the Southern District; Ark. Code Ann. §16-17-935(a). • Lonoke County is divided into the Northern District and the Southern District; Ark. Code Ann. §16-17-914(a). • Mississippi County is divided into the Osceola District and the Chickasawba District; Ark. Code Ann. §16-17-929(a). • Prairie County is divided into the Northern District and the Southern District; Ark. Code Ann. §16-17-927(a). • Sebastian County is divided into the Forth Smith District and the Greenwood District; Ark. Const. art. XIII, §5; Ark. Code Ann. §16-17-903(a). • Washington County is divided into Springdale District, Fayetteville District, Elkins District, West Fork District, and Prairie Grove District; Ark. Code Ann. §16-17-919(a). and • Yell County is divided into the Northern District and the Southern District. Ark. Code Ann. §16-17-922. Other counties in Arkansas may have multiple district courts or multiple court locations throughout the county, but each court has countywide jurisdiction, rather than jurisdiction over only an assigned portion of the county. See, e.g., Ark. Code Ann. §16-17-906; Ark. Code Ann. §16-17-909; Ark. Code Ann. §16-17-912. Mississippi County The division of certain counties into multiple judicial districts raises the question of how the counties should fund each district. The Mississippi County Quorum Court (the county's legislative body) put forth a proposal to the county to renew an existing countywide sales tax and a separate proposal to use a portion of those funds to guarantee municipal bonds used to build a new courthouse in Blytheville, which would be used by the Chickasawba Judicial District. Residents of Osceola, the other judicial district in Mississippi County, filed suit, claiming that if the proposal were enacted it would be an illegal exaction on Mississippi County taxpayers, and requested an injunction to prevent an election on the proposal. The Supreme Court of Arkansas found in favor of the residents of Osceola and granted an injunction barring an election on the proposals in question. The court relied on Arkansas Act 81 of 1901, which originally created the two separate judicial districts. Section 20 of this act stated “[t]hat all revenue accruing to the county…from all sources whatever, shall be used for the exclusive benefit of the district in which the revenue shall arise.”The court found that provision in Section 20 barred the county from using funds from a countywide sales tax to benefit only the Chickasawba District. Mississippi County, Ark. v. Osceola, Ark., 515 S.W.3d 96, 2017 BL 64655 (Ark. 2017). Sebastian County The Arkansas Constitution requires that the two judicial districts in Sebastian County must each pay its own expenses. Ark. Const. art. XIII, §5. Funding of Judicial Districts in Other Counties The Supreme Court of Arkansas has dealt with funding for judicial districts in other counties as well. In 1893, the court heard a case regarding the two judicial districts in Clay County (Clay County now has only one judicial district). The Eastern District consisted of approximately two-thirds of the territory within Clay County, and the Western District contained approximately one-third. Due to this disparity, the county set the property tax rate in the Eastern District at 5 mills, and the rate in the Western District at only 3 mills. The court struck down the higher rate for the Eastern District, stating that “[t]he expense of maintaining two judicial districts in a county is necessarily a county expense” and a tax for that purpose “must be levied at a uniform rate upon all the taxable property of the county.” Hutchinson v. Ozark Land Co., 22 S.W. 173, 57 Ark. 554 (Ark. 1893). Residents of the Northern District of Arkansas County sued when the county created an improvement district to provide for a new courthouse there, using property taxes raised only in the Northern District. The court sided with the property owners in the Northern District, stating that the expense of maintaining the judicial district is “necessarily a county expense, and that the revenue to pay it can only be raised by a county tax.” Therefore the improvement district was not allowed, and instead a countywide tax was required to raise the funds for the Northern District courthouse. Williams v. Ark. Cnty. Courthouse Improvement Dist., 240 S.W. 725, 153 Ark. 469 (Ark. 1922).
