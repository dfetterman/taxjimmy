Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

Depends North Dakota applies the true object test to determine the taxability of transactions involving tangible personal property and a nontaxable service or exempt property. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-01(1)(c); State v. Am. W. Cmty. Promotions, Inc., 2002 ND 98, 645 N.W.2d 196 (N.D. 2002). Thus, if the purchaser's intent upon entering into the transaction was to obtain a nontaxable service or exempt property, the transaction is not subject to tax. However, if the purchaser's intent was to purchase taxable tangible personal property, the entire transaction is subject to tax. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-01(1)(c); State v. Am. W. Cmty. Promotions, Inc., 2002 ND 98, 645 N.W.2d 196 (N.D. 2002). BNA-SUTN ND 9.3.1.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Bundled Transactions

Depends Except as otherwise provided, North Dakota imposes sales and use tax upon the gross receipts of retailers for sales of tangible personal property including bundled transactions consisting entirely of tangible personal property. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-02.1(1)(a). A bundled transaction is a retail sale of two or more products, except real property and services to real property, where the products are otherwise distinct and identifiable, and the products are sold for one nonitemized price. A bundled transaction does not include the sale of any products in which the sales price varies, or is negotiable, based on the selection by the purchaser of the products included in the transaction. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-01(1). Distinct and identifiable products do not include packaging such as containers, boxes, sacks, bags, and bottles or other materials such as wrapping, labels, tags, and instruction guides that accompany the retail sale of the products and are incidental or immaterial to the retail sale. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-01(1)(a)(1). Examples of packaging that are incidental or immaterial include grocery sacks, shoeboxes, dry cleaning garment bags, and express delivery envelopes and boxes. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-01(1)(a)(1). A product provided free-of-charge with the required purchase of another product is also not a distinct and identifiable product. A product is provided free-of-charge if the sales price of the product purchased does not vary depending on the inclusion of the product provided free of charge. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-01(1)(a)(2). The phrase “one nonitemized price” does not include a price that is separately identified by product on binding sales or other supporting sales-related documentation made available to the customer in paper or electronic form, including an invoice, bill of sale, receipt, contract, service agreement, lease agreement, periodic notice of rates and services, rate card, or price list. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-01(1)(b). The following are not bundled transactions, even if the transaction would otherwise meet the definition of a bundled transaction:• sales of tangible personal property with a service, where the tangible personal property is essential to the use of the service, is provided exclusively in connection with the service, and the true object of the transaction is the service; N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-01(1)(c)(1). • sales of two or more services where one service is provided that is essential to the use or receipt of a second service, the first service is provided exclusively in connection with the second service, and the true object of the transaction is the second service; N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-01(1)(c)(2). • sales that include taxable products and nontaxable products where the purchase price or sales price of the taxable products is de minimis: N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-01(1)(c)(3). ○ “de minimis” means the seller's purchase price or sales price of the taxable products is 10 percent or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled products; N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-01(1)(c)(3)(a). ○ either the purchase price or the sales price of the products must be used to determine if the taxable products are de minimis, not a combination of both; N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-01(1)(c)(3)(b). and ○ the full term of a service contract must be used to determine if the taxable products are de minimis; N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-01(1)(c)(3)(c). and • sales of exempt tangible personal property and taxable tangible personal property where: N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-01(1)(c)(4). ○ the transaction includes food and food ingredients, drugs, durable medical equipment, mobility-enhancing equipment, over-the-counter drugs, prosthetic devices, or medical supplies; N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-01(1)(c)(4)(a). and ○ the seller's purchase price or sales price of the taxable tangible personal property is 50 percent or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled tangible personal property. Sellers may not use a combination of the purchase price and sales price of the tangible personal property when making the 50 percent determination for a transaction. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-01(1)(c)(4)(b). Bundled Telecommunication Services In the case of a bundled transaction of services that includes telecommunication services, if the price is attributable to services that are taxable and services that are nontaxable, the portion of the price attributable to the nontaxable service is subject to sales and use tax unless the provider can reasonably identify the nontaxable portion of the services from its books and records kept in the regular course of business. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-03.10; N.D. Admin. Code §81-04.1-04-41.1(5)(a). BNA-SUTN ND 9.3.2.
