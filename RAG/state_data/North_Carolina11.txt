Yes A privilege tax is imposed on a retailer engaged in business in North Carolina measured by the retailer's net taxable sales or gross receipts from each retail sale of taxable tangible personal property and enumerated services. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4(a); N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4(a)(1). This privilege tax is referred to as the state sales tax, and is intended to be passed onto the purchaser. The tax is a debt from the purchaser to the retailer until it is paid. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.7. The retailer is required to collect the tax due when the item is sold at retail and is considered to act as a trustee on behalf of the state. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.7. The privilege tax does not apply to products taxable under the Article 5F privilege tax, which is imposed in lieu of the state use tax at a rate varying between 0.3 percent and 1 percent depending on the type of transaction, and might have a maximum dollar amount. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.13(5a); N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-187.51; N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-187.51A; N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-187.51B; N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-187.52. The rules for collection and administration of this privilege tax are the same as those provided for the North Carolina use tax imposed by Article 5. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-187.52(a). The gross receipts or gross proceeds that are derived from or the total amount agreed to be paid for the lease or rental within North Carolina, of all kinds and types of tangible personal property not specifically exempt by statute are subject to the sales or use tax at the same rate applicable to the retail sale of such property. The tax must be computed and paid on the gross receipts, gross proceeds, or rental payable without any deduction whatsoever for any expense incident to the conduct of business, including (but not limited to) property taxes, interest, insurance fees, maintenance fees, and delivery charges. The tax is due and payable at the time a lessor bills a lessee for rent whether the billing is for a lump sum rental or on a monthly or other periodic basis. The North Carolina privilege tax imposed under Article 5F applies to a lease or rental of tangible personal property that, if purchased, would be subject to the privilege tax. North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Technical Bulletins Section 23-1. The privilege tax imposed under Article 5F is repealed effective July 1, 2018. 2017 N.C. S.B. 257, effective July 1, 2018. Items subject to the general rate are also subject to a local tax of 2 percent (2.5 percent in Alexander, Catawba, Cumberland, Haywood, Martin Pitt, Sampson, and Surry Counties). North Carolina Dept. of Rev., Sales and Use Tax. The local rate in Buncombe, Durham, Halifax, Montgomery, and Orange Counties increased to 2.25 percent in 2012. North Carolina Dept. of Rev., Form E-805(9-12).

Stat. §105-465; see also North Carolina Dept. of Rev., Sales and Use Tax. The combined general rate is the general rate set in N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4(a) plus the sum of the rates of the local sales and use taxes authorized by Subchapter VIII of this Chapter for every county in the state. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.3(4a).

Gen. Stat. §105-164.4, except the tax does not apply to the sales price of a manufactured home, a modular home, an aircraft, or a jet engine; • the sales price of food that is not otherwise exempt from tax pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.13, but is exempt from North Carolina's sales and use tax pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.13B;and • the sales price of a bundled transaction that includes food subject to tax, if the price of the food exceeds 10 percent of the price of the bundle. A retailer must determine the price of food in a bundled transaction. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-467(a); N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.13(27a). To enact the tax, the governing body of the county must submit a proposition in a special election to the voters of the county who then must approve it by a majority vote. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-465; N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-466(a). In the alternative, five years after a proposition to impose a one percent sales and use tax is submitted to the voters of the county in a special election, and the proposition to impose the tax does not pass, the board of county commissioners, with at least 10 days' public notice and after a public hearing on the issue, is authorized to impose the one percent local sales and use tax to the same extent and with the same effect as if the tax was originally approved by the voters. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-466(b). Under North Carolina law, if the authorized 2 percent local sales tax is enacted, it will apply to the following transactions:• The sales of tangible personal property subject to the general sales tax rate imposed by the state; • The gross receipts derived from the lease or rental of tangible personal property, when the lease or rental of the property is subject to the general sales tax rate imposed by the state;N.C.

The complimentary local use tax applies to the same items that are subject to the local sales tax and is imposed at the rate of one percent of the cost price of each item or article of tangible personal property that is not sold in the county but is used, consumed, or stored within the county. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-468. Under North Carolina law, if a local sales and use tax is imposed by a county, the locally imposed tax will provide for the same definitions, provisions, exemptions, exclusions, refunds, and sourcing rules as the state of North Carolina. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-467(b); N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-467(c); N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-474. However, the provisions of the First One-Cent Local Government Sales and Use Tax do not apply with respect to any building materials purchased for the purpose of fulfilling a lump sum or unit price contract, and thus, such building materials are exempt from the First One-Cent Local Government Sales and Use Tax, provided that the contract is entered into before the effective date of the tax. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-468.1. The First One-Cent Local Government Sales and Use Tax may be repealed in the same manner in which it was enacted, either by a majority vote of the electors to rescind the tax or by a resolution of the board of county commissioners to terminate the tax, if the sales and use tax was initially imposed by a resolution of the county commissioners without a special election. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-473(a); N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-473(b); N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-473(c).

Under North Carolina law, the adoption, levy, collection, distribution, administration, and repeal of the First One-Half Cent Local Government Sales and Use Tax will be in accordance with provisions of the First One-Cent Local Government Sales and Use Tax. The sales and use tax exemption for building materials provided for under the First One-Cent Local Government Sales and Use Tax does not apply to the First One-Half Cent Local Government Sales and Use Tax, and thus, such building materials are subject to the First One-Half Cent Local Government Sales and Use Tax. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-483. Second One-Half Cent Local Government Sales and Use Tax North Carolina law also authorizes cities and counties to impose an additional 0.5 percent sales and use tax on certain enumerated transactions within the county for the purpose of meeting their growing financial needs.

The sales and use tax exemption for building materials provided for under the First One-Cent Local Government Sales and Use Tax does not apply to the Second One-Half Cent Local Government Sales and Use Tax, and thus, such building materials are subject to the Second One-Half Cent Local Government Sales and Use Tax. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-498.

Stat. §105-537(d). Further, the One-Quarter Cent County Sales and Use Tax does not apply to the sales price of food that is exempt from tax pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.13B or to the sales price of a bundled transaction taxable pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-467(a)(5a). N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-538.

The financial plan must also be approved by the board of commissioners of each county in the district, and the tax must be approved by the voters of the special district before it may be imposed.
