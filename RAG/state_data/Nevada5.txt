Any tangible personal property purchased by a construction contractor for use in the performance of a construction contract for improvement to real property is deemed to have been purchased for use in improving real property. If any purchase is made and sales tax is not paid because the vendor did not have a valid Nevada seller's permit, or for any other reason, the use tax applies based upon the sales price of the property to the contractor. Nev. Admin. Code ch. 372, §372.200; Nevada Tax Notes April 2012; Nevada Tax Notes April 2011.

Construction contractors are considered the consumers of any material purchased to fulfill a construction contract. This means that a contractor is required to pay the sales tax when they purchase the material. When the contractor bills a customer for the finished work there should be no sales tax added to the final contract price or invoice. This is because the tax has already been paid by the contractor when they purchased the material.

Exempt Construction Contracts With Government Entities Nevada specifies that the U.S., its incorporated agencies and instrumentalities;Nevada, its unincorporated agencies and instrumentalities; and any county, city or district or other political subdivision of Nevada are granted exemption from sales and use taxes for purchases or sales. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.325; Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.340; Nev. Admin. Code ch. 372, §372.680. An exemption letter from the Nevada Department of Taxation is not required for a governmental organization to be exempt, but, when requested, the department may provide governmental organizations with exemption certificates. While a governmental organization that purchases tangible personal property with a governmental credit card is exempt, this exemption applies only to direct sales to governmental organizations; tangible personal property sold to or used by a government contractor is subject to the sales or use tax unless the contractor is a constituent part of the governmental entity. For example, if a government contractor purchases building materials for use on a public works project, the government contractor must pay sales or use tax on those materials. Additionally, states, other than Nevada, purchasing tangible personal property in Nevada are not exempt. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.325; Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.340; Nev. Admin. Code ch. 372, §372.680; Nevada Tax Notes April 2012. A public body, such as a governmental entity, is prohibited from purchasing supplies for its construction contracts itself to avoid the materials being taxed when purchased by a contractor. Any state or local taxes that would have been due if the construction materials or good were purchased by the contractor are due if the materials are purchased by the public body. When a public body enters into a construction contract, it must send an itemized list of construction materials purchased to the Department, and include the amount paid for each item. Nevada Tax Bulletin SUT 16-0002 (June 27, 2016). Public bodies do not need to pay sales or use tax on materials or submit a list of construction materials to the Department if the public body performs the construction work itself. Public bodies are also allowed to purchase construction materials itself without paying tax if the contract is for devices, equipment, or hardware which are needed on a recurring basis and use to protect the health, safety or welfare of the public. Further, the public body may purchase construction materials itself without paying tax if contract is for the purchase of specialized components which are specific to a particular project and which are not commonly used in public works projects. Nevada Tax Bulletin SUT 16-0002 (June 27, 2016). Clark County Construction Contracts A contractor or subcontractor that has entered into a contract involving the sale or purchase of tangible personal property used in the performance of a written contract for the construction of an improvement to real property prior to January 1, 2016 may be entitled to a refund from sales tax due to the increase in the local sales tax rate in Clark County. Nevada Contract Refunds. Such a contractor or subcontractor may be entitled to a refund for the duration of the contract if:• the contract was entered into on or before January 1, 2016 or a binding bid was submitted before January 1, 2016 and was accepted; and • pursuant to the terms of the contract, the contract price or bid amount may not be adjusted to reflect the increase in sales tax.
