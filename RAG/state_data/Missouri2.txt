Topic: Administration and Procedure Agencies Responsible for Administration Local Sales and Use Tax

Missouri Department of Revenue Missouri law requires that all local and state sales and use taxes are to be collected together and reported on forms and under administrative rules and regulations as prescribed by the Director of Revenue. Mo. Rev. Stat. §32.087(6); Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.757(3); Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.757(4). Any retailer located within the jurisdiction of one or more taxing entities is required to add all taxes imposed at the local level, along with those at the state level, and multiply the combined rate times the amount of sale. Mo. Rev. Stat. §32.087(3). Additionally, the same sales tax permit, exemption certificate and retail certificates are sufficient for the local sales tax requirements, with no additional permits or certificates being required. Mo. Rev. Stat. §32.087(9). The state also authorizes the same discounts to be provided to the retailer for the collection of and payment of local sales taxes that are provided for the collection and payment of state sales taxes. Mo. Rev. Stat. §32.087(10). Missouri law also provides that the same penalties applicable to violations of the state sales tax, are also authorized for the local sales taxes. Mo. Rev. Stat. §32.087(11). In the event that one or more local sales taxes have been imposed, the same limitations to bringing suit that apply at the state level, apply at the local level. Mo. Rev. Stat. §32.087(16). Additionally, where the director of revenue determines that suit must be filed against someone for delinquent state sales taxes, and there are delinquent taxes under local law, the director of revenue is required to notify the taxing entity in the event that the person fails or refuses to pay the local sales tax due, so that the local jurisdiction may take appropriate action. Mo. Rev. Stat. §32.087(16). All provisions which govern the state sales tax also apply to the collection of any local sales taxes. Mo. Rev. Stat. §32.087(5); Mo. Rev. Stat. §32.087(7); Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.757(3); Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.757(4). If any local sales tax on the titling of motor vehicles, trailers, boats, and outboard motors purchased from a source other than a licensed Missouri dealer is repealed after the general election in November 2014, or if the taxing jurisdiction failed to present the ballot to the voters at a general election on or before November 2018, then the governing body of such taxing jurisdiction may, at any election subsequent to the repeal or after the general election in November 2018, if the jurisdiction failed to present the ballot to the voters, place before the voters the issue of imposing a sales tax on the titling of motor vehicles, trailers, boats, and outboard motors that are subject to state sales tax under Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.020 that were purchased from a source other than a licensed Missouri dealer. Mo. Rev. Stat. §32.087(8), as enacted by 2016 Mo. H.B. 2140, effective Aug. 28, 2016. If any local sales tax on the titling of motor vehicles, trailers, boats, and outboard motors purchased from a source other than a licensed Missouri dealer is adopted, then the tax takes effect and is imposed on the first day of the second calendar quarter after the election. Mo. Rev. Stat. §32.087(9), as enacted by 2016 Mo. H.B. 2140, effective Aug. 28, 2016. Regional Jail District Sales Tax Missouri allows the commission of any regional jail district to impose a sales tax of 0.125, 0.25, 0.375, or 0.5 percent on all taxable retail sales, to provide jail services and court facilities for the region. Mo. Rev. Stat. §221.407(1). That provision expires on Sept. 30, 2028. See (Mo. Rev. Stat. §221.407(8), as amended by 2016 Mo. S.B. 765, effective Aug. 28, 2016(extending the expiration date to Sept. 30, 2028, from the previous expiration date of Sept. 30, 2015). BNA-SUTN MO 31.1.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Vendor/Seller Registration

Required All persons who are responsible for the collection of sales tax must procure a retail sales license prior to making sales at retail. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.083.1; Missouri Letter Ruling LR6428 (Aug. 27, 2010). A prerequisite to the issuance or renewal of any license is a statement from the Department of Revenue stating that the licensee owes no sales tax. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.083.2. In-state companies that conduct all their business purchases and sales out of state are not required to register with the Department of Revenue for a retail sales tax license. Missouri Letter Ruling LR7772 (Jan. 5, 2017). The license is valid until revoked or surrendered. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.083.1. The license may be revoked only in the event the licensee has been in default for 60 days, however prior to revocation, the licensee must be given 10 days' notice. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.083.1. Effective Aug. 28, 2018, taxpayers applying for a retail sales tax license or vendors use tax, and taxpayers seeking reinstatement of a revoked license may be required to submit a bond by the Missouri Director of Revenue. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.087, as amended by 2018 Mo. S.B. 884, effective Aug. 28, 2018. Prior to Aug. 28, 2018, all taxpayers applying for a retail sales tax license or vendors use tax, and taxpayers seeking reinstatement of a revoked license were required to submit a bond. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.087, as amended by 2016 Mo. H.B. 823, effective Aug. 28, 2016 (decreasing the time from two years to one year); Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-104.020(1). The bond may be a cash bond, surety bond, certificate of deposit or an irrevocable letter of credit. The bond may be refunded to the taxpayer after one year of satisfactory tax compliance or when the tax payer closes its sales/use tax account, provided the account has no outstanding delinquencies. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.087, as amended by 2016 Mo. H.B. 823, effective Aug. 28, 2016 (decreasing the time from two years to one year); Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-104.020(1). A vendor may be required to file a bond or letter of credit to secure the payment of the use tax, interest and penalties that may become due. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.625. Further, a vendor must designate an agent for service of process in Missouri. If a vendor fails to designate an agent, the vendor is deemed to:• agree to be subject to the jurisdiction of Missouri; • appoint the Secretary of State of Missouri as his lawful attorney and agent upon whom service may be given; and • agree that any process served will have the same legal force and validity as if personally served in Missouri. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.630. BNA-SUTN MO 31.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Tax Collection and Remittance

Depends The primary burden of the sales or use tax is placed on sellers or vendors making the sale in Missouri. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.021; Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.635. Sales Tax The primary burden of the sales tax is placed on the seller making the taxable sale. The seller must collect the tax from the purchaser and remit it to the Department of Revenue. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.021; see Six Flags Theme Parks Inc. v. Missouri Dir. of Rev., 102 S.W.3d 526 (Mo. 2003); Bates v. Missouri Dir. of Rev., 691 S.W.2d 273 (Mo. 1985). The seller's inability to collect any part of the tax due does not relieve the seller of the obligation to pay the tax imposed. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.080.4. Any seller may advertise or hold out or state to the public or to any customer either directly or indirectly that the tax or any part of the tax required to be collected by the seller will be assumed or absorbed by the seller provided that the amount of tax assumed or absorbed will be stated on any invoice or receipt for the property sold or service rendered. Missouri provides that any seller in violation of these advertising and holding out provisions is guilty of a misdemeanor. Sellers that are prohibited from collecting and remitting sales tax under Mo. Rev. Stat. §66.630 are prohibited from advertising in this manner. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.080.5, as amended by 2015 Mo. H.B. 517, effective Aug. 28, 2015. Use Tax The primary burden of the use tax is placed on the vendor making the sale of tangible personal property for the purpose of storage, use, or consumption in Missouri. The vendor must collect from the purchaser an amount equivalent to the sales tax imposed by Missouri and give the purchaser a receipt showing the tax paid. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.635. If a purchaser does not pay the tax due to the vendor, the purchaser must file a return and remit the tax due to the Director of Revenue. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.655.4. However, the purchaser is not required to file a use tax return when the taxable purchases are less than$2,000 in a calendar year. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.655.5; Missouri Form 4340: Individual Consumer's Use Tax Return. This is an exclusion from filing, but not a $2,000 use tax exemption. Therefore, if the annual taxable purchases on which tax has not been paid equals or exceeds $2,000, the taxpayer must report and pay on the total taxable purchases, including the first$2,000. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-103.250(2)(B). An out-of-state seller with nexus must collect tax even if the buyer expects to have less than $2,000 in out-of-state purchases for the year. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-103.250(2)(C); Missouri Letter Ruling LR7774 (Jan. 5, 2017). Similar to the restrictions on sellers with respect to the sales tax, vendors are prohibited from advertising or holding out to the state or to the public or to any customer, either directly or indirectly, that the use tax or any part of the tax required to be collected by a vendor will be assumed or absorbed by him, or that it will not be added to the selling price of the property sold, or that it will be refunded in whole or in part if it was added. A violation of this prohibition on advertising an absorption of the use tax is also a misdemeanor in Missouri. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.730. BNA-SUTN MO 31.3.1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Purchaser Liability

Yes The primary burden of the use tax is placed on the vendor making the sale of tangible personal property for the purpose of storage, use, or consumption in Missouri. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.635. If a purchaser does not pay the tax due to the vendor, the purchaser must file a return and remit the tax due to the Director of Revenue. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.655.4. However, the purchaser is not required to file a use tax return when the taxable purchases are less than$2,000 in a calendar year. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.655.5. This is an exclusion from filing, but not a $2,000 use tax exemption. Therefore, if the annual taxable purchases on which tax has not been paid equals or exceeds $2,000 the taxpayer must report and pay on the total taxable purchases, including the first $2,000. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-103.250(2)(B). An out-of-state seller with nexus must collect tax even if the buyer expects to have less than $2,000 in out-of-state purchases for the year. Mo.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Business Owners, Operators

Yes If a final tax assessment is made against a corporation and the corporation fails to pay the tax assessed, an assessment for the tax may be brought against a responsible officer, director, or statutory trustee of the corporation. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.157(3). The officers, directors, and trustees against whom such an assessment may be brought include those having the direct control, supervision, or responsibility for filing the corporation's sales and use tax returns. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.157(3); see Bisch v. Missouri Dir. of Rev., No. 11-1813 RS (Mo. Admin. Hearing Comn., Feb. 5, 2014) (holding that the president of a corporation could be held personally liable for the corporation's sales and use tax where, by signing the corporation's sales tax returns, he had attested to the fact that he had direct control, supervision, or responsibility for filing the corporation's returns). In Missouri, the persons responsible for filing returns and paying tax who fail to do so are personally assessed for outstanding tax, interest and penalties, provided that a final assessment has been made against the corporation and the corporation has failed to pay the amounts due. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.157.3; see also Whitby v. Director of Rev., No. 93-001366RV (Mo. Tax Comm. Aug. 17, 1995) (corporation's president was responsible for paying uncollected sales taxes pursuant to §144.157.3). The personal liability of such persons survives the administrative dissolution of the corporation or the revocation of an out-of-state corporation's certificate of authority. Whitby v. Director of Rev., 896 S.W.2d 636 (Mo. banc 1995). Instead of imposing personal liability only against responsible persons who act willfully, Missouri law imposes personal liability against both responsible persons acting willfully and those acting without intent to avoid tax. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.157.1 and Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.157.3. The Missouri law therefore serves both to deter persons acting willfully and to simply provide another source for satisfying a corporation's unpaid sales and use tax liability. See Whitby v. Director of Rev., 896 S.W.2d 636 (Mo. banc 1995) . If a tax assessment is made against a partnership, all partners are jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the assessment. LLCs are treated consistently with their classification for federal income tax purposes. Missouri Administrative Decision 14-1221-RS (Sept. 13, 2017) (LLC members treated as partners because the LLC filed federal taxes as a partnership). BNA-SUTN MO 31.3.3.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Due Date Filing

20th of the Month Under Missouri law, the frequency with which a taxpayer must file sales and use tax returns is based on the monthly amount of sales or use tax collected from all of the taxpayer's business locations during a calendar year. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-104.030(3)(B). Any local, conservation or parks and soils taxes should not be considered part of the total taxes paid for purposes of determining a taxpayer's filing frequency. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-104.030(3)(B). Under Missouri law, a sales or use tax return will be considered timely filed if the postmark stamp falls on or before the filing due date. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-104.030(3)(D). Due Dates for Various Types of Returns Quarter-Monthly Remittance Due Date If state tax collections equal or exceed $15,000 per month in six of the last 12 months, the taxpayer may be required to remit taxes on a quarter-monthly basis. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-104.030(3)(H); see Missouri Dept. of Rev., E-file Required for Quarter-Monthly Sales Tax; Missouri Dept. of Rev., 2019 Tax Calendar. A quarter-month is divided as follows:• The first seven days of a calendar month; • The 8th through the 15th day of a calendar month; • The 16th through the 22nd day of a calendar month; and • The 23rd day through the last day of a calendar month. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-104.030(2); see Missouri Dept. of Rev., E-file Required for Quarter-Monthly Sales Tax; Missouri Dept. of Rev., 2019 Tax Calendar. A quarter-monthly return is due within three banking days after the end of each period. A quarter-monthly taxpayer must file a monthly return and remit any unpaid amounts. Mo. Code Regs.

Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-104.030(3)(B)(1); Missouri Dept. of Rev., 2019 Tax Calendar. Generally, monthly returns must be filed on or before the 20th day of the month that follows the close of the preceding month. However, monthly returns that represent the last month of a calendar quarter are due on the last day of the following month. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-104.030(3)(C); Missouri Dept. of Rev., 2019 Tax Calendar. Quarterly Filing Due Date Missouri requires taxpayers that have a monthly sales tax liability of less than $500 per month but greater than or equal to $45 per calendar quarter to file on a quarterly basis. Beginning July 30, 2013 the $45 per calendar quarter minimum will increase to $100 per calendar quarter. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-104.030(3)(B)(2), as amended June 30, 2013; Missouri Dept. of Rev., 2019 Tax Calendar.

Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-104.030(3)(C). Use Tax Returns Individuals and businesses that purchase and consume non-exempt tangible personal property from out-of-state vendors without otherwise paying sales tax to a retailer that is required to collect the tax must file use tax returns with the Missouri Department of Revenue. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-103.250. Purchasers are liable for use tax until the purchaser has proof of paying Missouri use tax to the seller. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-103.250(2)(D). However, any sales or use tax properly paid by the purchaser to another state will be credited against the use tax due to the State of Missouri. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-103.250(1). Any amount of tax reported by the taxpayer as use tax due must accompany the return when it is filed. An individual who is not required to hold a sales tax permit and who makes out-of-state purchases of tangible personal property for personal use in an amount that is less than $2,000 annually is not required to file a use tax return. If an individual who is not required to hold a sales tax permit makes out-of-state purchases for personal use in an amount that is greater than or equal to $2,000, the individual must file an annual use tax return and remit use tax on the entire amount of purchased property, not excluding the first $2,000. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-103.250(2)(B). An out-of-state retailer than has nexus with Missouri and is therefore required to collect and remit use tax must collect the tax and file a return even if the retailer expects to have less than $2,000 in use tax due per year. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-103.250(2)(C). Amended Returns The Missouri Department of Revenue requires individuals and businesses to file amended sales and use tax returns if an error or omission is discovered in a return or a change is necessary to show the taxpayer's true tax liability. Generally, taxpayers may elect to correct any tax mistakes by filing the corrected information with the Department of Revenue along with the next subsequent return if the error is discovered before that subsequent return is due. If the error is not discovered within this limited period of time, then the taxpayer must file an amended return. If, as a result of the amended return, the taxpayer expects to receive a refund from the Department of Revenue, the taxpayer must also file an application for refund. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144-100(4). Business Termination If a person sells all or substantially all of his business or stock of goods, or quits the business, he must file a final return within 15 days after the date of selling or quitting the business.

Authorized The Director of Revenue or his authorized agents are authorized to examine a taxpayer's books and records in order to determine the correctness of any return or to determine the amount of sales and use tax due. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.645. Based upon these books and records or upon any other information of which he or his agents come into possession, the Director of Revenue is authorized to make an assessment of additional tax due. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.210; see, e.g., Missouri Administrative Decision 12-1516-RS (July 11, 2014) (upholding an assessment of additional tax due based upon an estimation of undocumented taxable cash receipts as being equal to 34 percent of credit and debit card receipts). The scope of this authorization includes any information that may be found on the taxpayer's federal and state income tax returns. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.330. Furthermore, the director may require the attendance of any person for the purpose of taking his testimony with respect to any matter within the purview of the Director of Revenue. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.645. Missouri also provides that no person may be excused from testifying or producing documents in an investigation or hearing based upon the grounds that such testimony or document production may tend to incriminate that person. The Code also provides that no person may be subjected to any criminal penalty for any such testimony or production of documents. However, this immunity only extends to a natural person who, in obedience to a subpoena, gives testimony under oath or produces evidence, documentary, or otherwise. Furthermore, the immunity does not extend to any perjury committed by the person so testifying and, therefore, such persons will be subject to prosecution. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.340. Hearings or investigations conducted by the Director of Revenue or any of his agents are not bound by the technical rules of evidence. This means that no informality in any proceeding, or in the manner of taking testimony, will invalidate any order, decision, rule, or regulation made or confirmed by the Director of Revenue.
