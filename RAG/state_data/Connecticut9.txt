Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

Yes The Connecticut Department of Revenue Services has applied the true object test to a transaction involving the receipt of computer and data processing services, in addition to other mixed transactions. See Connecticut Ruling 1994-2 (Jan. 6, 1994). In Connecticut Ruling 1994-2, the Department stated that to be taxable the computer use must be essential to the provision of the service, and not merely incidental. Connecticut Ruling 1994-2 (Jan. 6, 1994). The taxpayer manually collected real property transfer records from town records and input the same on its database. Subscribers had two-hour access to the database and the information was available almost immediately. The Department reasoned that subscribers could have done their searches by hand in the various town halls. Instead, they opted for the accuracy and immediacy made possible by computer services. As such, the Department ruled that the true object of the transaction was to receive the computer services. The computer's speed, according to the Department, was the very reason why subscribers used the service. Connecticut Ruling 1994-2 (Jan. 6, 1994). In another ruling, Connecticut Ruling 1993-21, the true object test was applied to the tax upon services by employment agencies and agencies providing personnel services pursuant to the definition of “sale” and “selling” under former Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(2)(i)(C). Generally, if the true object of a purchaser is to contract for individuals whom they can control as employees, the charges are taxable. Connecticut Ruling 1993-21 (Oct. 27, 1993); see also Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(2)(I) (providing current definitions of the terms “sales” and “selling”as they apply to services). The taxpayer provided library personnel to law firms desirous of employing individuals either to perform as librarians, or in the alternative, as loose-leaf service updaters. The Department opined that the test for whether such services were taxable depended upon whether the purchaser sought out an individual whom they would treat as an employee subject to their direction, or rather to perform specific tasks without any supervisory direction on its part. The Department held that charges for individuals performing as librarians were taxable after analyzing the client's control over such individuals. The Department contrasted that control with the control imposed upon loose-leaf service updaters. There was little need or opportunity to exert control over individuals who update loose-leaf services. As such, the charges for the loose-leaf filing services were not subject to the tax on personnel services. In Hartford Parkview Assoc. Ltd. P'ship v. Groppo, the true object test was at issue where the taxpayer was accessed on a reservation service provided to it by the Hilton Reservation Service (HRS). Computer and data processing services are specifically delineated taxable services under Connecticut law. The taxpayer's and HRS’ computers interfaced in order to exchange information about room availability and rates, and to retrieve information about reservations. HRS charged a fee for each reservation it made. The Department imposed a use tax on these fees pursuant to former Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(2)(i)(A) as interpreted by §12-426-27(b)(1) of the regulations, as the rendering of computer and data processing services. The court held that the regulations were too broad. According to the court, under the regulations, any service in which a computer was used would be taxed as a computer service. The court instead looked to the true object of the transaction and determined it to be to obtain and inform the taxpayer of reservations HRS had made for the hotel. The utilization of a computer in obtaining the service did not trigger the sales and use tax. Hartford Parkview Assoc. Ltd. P'ship v. Groppo, 558 A.2d 993, 211 Conn. 246 (Conn. 1989); see Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(2) for the current definition of “sale” and “selling.” BNA-SUTN CT 9.3.1.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Bundled Transactions

No Guidance Connecticut does not address the taxability of bundled transactions. Telecommunication Services If nontaxable charges are aggregated with and not separately stated from taxable charges for telecommunication services, then the nontaxable charges may be subject to tax unless the provider can reasonably identify charges not subject to sales tax from its books and records that are kept in the regular course of business. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407a(d). A customer may not rely upon the nontaxability of charges for services unless the customer's provider separately states the charges for nontaxable services from taxable charges for telecommunication services or the provider elects, after receiving a written request from the customer in the form required by the provider, to provide verifiable data based upon the provider's books and records that are kept in the regular course of business that reasonably identify the nontaxable charges. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407a(d). BNA-SUTN CT 9.3.2.
