Taxable Nevada imposes upon retailers a tax on gross receipts derived from the sale of all tangible personal property at retail within the state. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.105. The state imposes the taxes upon the sale, lease, rental, storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property. However, service providers are responsible for paying the applicable sales or use tax due on tangible personal property used in performing their service. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.095; Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.100; Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.085; Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.105. Nevada presumes that all gross receipts are subject to tax unless the contrary is established. The burden of proof is upon the person making the sale to show that the sale is not subject to tax. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.155. More information on the taxation of property is available at 1300 T.M., Sales and Use Taxes: General Principles and 1360 T.M., Sales and Use Taxes: Retail Sales Issues. BNA-SUTN NV 9.1.

Enumerated Services Only Unless specifically enumerated, services are exempt from sales and use tax in Nevada. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.060(3) The definition of “tangible personal property” does not include the provision of a service. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.095; Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.100; Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.085; Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.105. Nevada specifically includes within the state's definition of “sale” the:• producing, fabricating, processing, printing or imprinting of tangible personal property for a consideration for consumers who furnish, either directly or indirectly, the materials used in the producing, fabricating, processing, printing or imprinting; Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.060(3)(a). and • furnishing, preparing, or serving for a consideration of food, meals or drinks. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.060(3)(c).

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

Primary Purpose Nevada applies the “primary purpose” test to determine whether a transaction is for services or for tangible personal property. Nevada Tax Comm'n v. Nevada Cement Co., 36 P.3d 418 (Nev. 2001). If the primary purpose of the transaction is the purchase of taxable tangible personal property or taxable services, the entire charge for the transaction is subject to tax. Nevada Tax Comm'n v. Nevada Cement Co., 36 P.3d 418 (Nev. 2001). In Nevada Tax Commission v. Nevada Cement Company, the Nevada Supreme Court used the primary purpose test to determine whether or not manufacturing equipment purchased by Nevada Cement was subject to tax. The court wrote that “in determining whether manufacturing equipment is taxable …, one must consider the equipment's primary purpose. If the property is purchased primarily to aid the manufacturing process, it is taxable, despite the fact that some portion becomes a part of the finished product. Conversely, if the property is purchased primarily for incorporation into a final product, it is not taxable, despite the fact that some portion may assist the manufacturing process.” Nevada Tax Comm'n v. Nevada Cement Co., 36 P.3d 418 (Nev. 2001). BNA-SUTN NV 9.3.1.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Bundled Transactions

Taxable Nevada imposes the sales or use tax upon the total amount of consideration received by a vendor in connection with the sale of a bundled transaction. Nev. Admin. Code ch. 372, §372.045(1). A “bundled transaction”is a retail sale involving two or more products sold for one non-itemized price. Outside of the bundled transaction the products are otherwise distinct and identifiable, each being sold separately. Bundled transactions do not include the sale of any products where the price is variable, with the price being determined based upon selections of products made by the consumer. Likewise, bundled transactions cannot involve real property or services to real property. Nev. Admin. Code ch. 372, §372.045(2). A transaction otherwise satisfying the definition of a bundled transaction will not be considered a bundled transaction if it is any of the following:• a retail sale of tangible personal property and a service where the tangible personal property is essential to the use of the service, and the tangible personal property is provided exclusively in connection with the service, so long as the true object of the transaction is the service; Nev. Admin. Code ch. 372, §372.045(2)(b)(2). • a transaction that includes taxable products and nontaxable products, and the purchase price or sales price of the taxable products is de minimis, 10 percent or less of the total price of the bundled products; Nev. Admin. Code ch. 372, §372.045(2)(b)(3). or • a retail sale of exempt tangible personal property and taxable tangible personal property where the transaction includes food and food ingredients, drugs, durable medical equipment, mobility-enhancing equipment, over-the-counter drugs, prosthetic devices, or medical supplies, and the vendor's or seller's purchase price or sales price of the taxable tangible personal property is 50 percent or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled tangible personal property. Vendors and sellers may not use a combination of the purchase price and sales price of the tangible personal property when making the fifty per cent determination for a transaction. Nev. Admin. Code ch. 372, §372.045(2)(b)(4). BNA-SUTN NV 9.3.2.

Conforms to State Nevada law requires that all local sales and use taxes adopt provisions substantially identical to those contained in chapter 374, which is the Local School Support Tax. See Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §374A.010(2). Thus, all local sales and use taxes will be applied in the same manner as the Local School Support Tax. See Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §374A.010(2); Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §376A.060(1); Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §377.040(2); Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §377A.030(2); Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §377B.110(2). Local School Support Tax The local school support sales tax is imposed upon the gross receipts derived from the sale off all tangible personal property sold at retail, including specific services related to the sale of tangible personal property, within the county. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §374.110; Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §374.065. Likewise, the complementary local school support use tax is imposed upon the gross receipts derived from tangible personal property purchased for storage, use or other consumption within a county in Nevada. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §374.190(1). The use tax is also imposed on all property acquired outside of the state that would have been a taxable sale had it occurred within Nevada. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §374.190(2). The tax base for the local school support tax is the same base as the state sales and use tax. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.060; Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.105; Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.185; Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §374.065; Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §374.110; Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §374.190. The retail sale of all tangible personal property, excluding the lease or rental of tangible personal property, within Nevada are sourced to the seller's place of business if the property purchased is received by the purchaser at the seller's place of business. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.360(1); see Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §374.723. If the property is not received by the purchaser at the seller's place of business the transaction is sourced to either the place where the purchaser has asked that the property be delivered to, or, if no delivery destination is given, to the place where the purchaser takes delivery of the property. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.360(2); see Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §374.723. If none of the above options apply, the transaction is sourced to the address of the purchaser as found on the business records of the seller. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.360(3); see Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §374.723. If no address is had in the business's records, the transaction is sourced to any address provided by the purchaser during the consummation of the sale, including the address of the purchaser's instrument of payment. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.360(4); see Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §374.723. If all these methods fail, the transaction is sourced to the location from where the property was shipped. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.360(5); see Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §374.723. The lease or rental of tangible personal property requiring recurring periodic payments is sourced in two separate fashions. The first payment is sourced to the location where the lease or rental was deemed to take place, normally the place of business from the lessor. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.365(1)(a)(1); see Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §374.723. Subsequent payments are sourced to the primary location of the leased or rented property, normally the address provided by the lessee. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.365(1)(a)(2); see Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §374.723. If the lease or rental does not require recurring payments, the transaction is sourced in the same manner as the retail sale of tangible personal property. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360B.365(1)(b); see Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §374.723. BNA-SUTN NV 9.4.
