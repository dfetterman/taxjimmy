H.P. 1279, effective Oct. 1, 2019; Bloomberg Tax Survey of State Tax Departments. The retail sale of tangible personal property is sourced according to the following rules:A. When the tangible personal property is received by the purchaser at a business location of the seller, the sale is sourced to that business location. B. When the tangible personal property is not received by the purchaser at a business location of the seller, the sale is sourced to the location where receipt by the purchaser or the purchaser's donee occurs, including the location indicated by instructions for delivery to the purchaser or donee known to the seller. C. For a sale when A and B do not apply, the sale is sourced to the location indicated by an address for the purchaser that is available from the business records of the seller that are maintained in the ordinary course of the seller's business when use of this address does not constitute bad faith. D. For a sale when A, B, and C do not apply, the sale is sourced to the location indicated by an address for the purchaser obtained during the consummation of the sale, including the address of a purchaser's payment instrument, if no other address is available, when use of this address does not constitute bad faith. E. When A, B, C, and D do not apply, including the circumstance in which the seller is without sufficient information to apply paragraphs A to D, the location is determined by the address from which tangible personal property was shipped, from which the tangible personal property or taxable service transferred electronically was first available for transmission by the seller or from which the service was provided, disregarding for these purposes any location that merely provided the digital transfer of the tangible personal property or taxable service sold. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1819(2), as added by 2019 Me. H.P. 1279, effective Oct. 1, 2019. “Receive” and “receipt”means taking possession of tangible personal property or taking possession or making first use to products transferred electronically, whichever comes first.

Mobile telecommunications services are subject to separate sourcing rules. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1819(2), as added by 2019 Me. H.P. 1279, effective Oct. 1, 2019; Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §2552(1). The retail sale of tangible personal property is sourced according to the following rules:A.

When the taxable service is not received by the purchaser at a business location of the seller, the sale is sourced to the location where receipt by the purchaser or the purchaser's donee occurs, including the location indicated by instructions for delivery to the purchaser or donee known to the seller. C. For a sale when A and B do not apply, the sale is sourced to the location indicated by an address for the purchaser that is available from the business records of the seller that are maintained in the ordinary course of the seller's business when use of this address does not constitute bad faith. D. For a sale when A, B, and C do not apply, the sale is sourced to the location indicated by an address for the purchaser obtained during the consummation of the sale, including the address of a purchaser's payment instrument, if no other address is available, when use of this address does not constitute bad faith.

Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1819(2), as added by 2019 Me. H.P. 1279, effective Oct. 1, 2019. “Receive”and “receipt” means making first use of services. Me. Rev. Stat.

Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Maine tax law relating to the sourcing of mobile telecommunications has been modified to comply with the federal Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §2556(1); Maine General Information Bulletin No. 92; Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 56. Accordingly, the Maine Service Provider Tax applies to wireless calls that are billed to a customer whose primary place of use is in Maine to the extent the services are associated with transmission that originate and terminate within Maine or within any other state. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §2556(1); Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 56. Therefore with respect to sourcing, when mobile telecommunications services are provided to a customer whose place of primary use is located in Maine and the charges are billed by or for the customer's home service provider, the services are deemed to be provided at the customer's place of primary use. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §2556(1). A customer's place of primary use generally means either the residential address or the primary business street address of the customer, and must be a location within the licensed service area of the home service provider.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Leases and Rentals

Destination Tangible personal property leased in the state of Maine is subject to sales, use, and service provider tax. See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1752(13); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1752(11); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1811; Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1861; Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 20.

Service providers must also remit service provider tax in connection with the lease or rental of certain types of property, such as rental of video media and equipment, and rental of furniture, audio media equipment pursuant to a rental-purchase agreement. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §2552(1). Property that is used outside of Maine for more than 12 months prior to being used in Maine is not subject to use tax. This includes leases executed outside of Maine since lessors are the “users” of the leased property. If a lessee subsequently makes use of the leased property in Maine, no use tax is due from the lessor. Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 20. BNA-SUTN ME 4.1.3.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Credit for Tax Paid to Another Jurisdiction

Yes Maine's use tax does not apply to the use, storage, or other consumption in Maine of tangible personal property or taxable services purchased outside the state, upon which the purchaser has paid a sales or use tax imposed by another taxing jurisdiction that is equal to or greater than Maine's sales and use tax. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1862. However, if the amount of sales or use tax paid to another taxing jurisdiction is less than the amount of Maine's sales and use tax that would be imposed, then the purchaser must pay to the Maine State Tax Assessor an amount sufficient to make the total amount of sales and use tax paid to the other taxing jurisdiction and Maine, equal to Maine's sales and use tax. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1862. BNA-SUTN ME 4.2.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Temporary Presence, In-Transit Property Tangible Personal Property Purchased for Use Out-of-state

Depends The taxability of tangible personal property purchased for use outside Maine depends upon where the purchaser takes possession of the property. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1760(82); Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 3. Sales of tangible personal property will be exempt from sales and use tax if delivered to a location outside of Maine or to the United States Postal Service, a common carrier, or a contract carrier hired by the seller for delivery to a location outside of Maine, regardless of whether the property is purchased F.O.B. shipping point or other point in Maine and regardless of whether passage of title occurs in Maine. However, if the customer takes delivery of the product in Maine, the sale is sourced to Maine, and is therefore subject to the Maine sales tax, regardless of the ultimate destination of the product. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1760(82); Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 3. Furthermore, Maine's definition of “use” does not include keeping, retaining or exercising power over tangible personal property brought into the State for the purpose of subsequently transporting it outside the State for use by the purchaser thereafter solely outside the State or for the purpose of being processed, fabricated, manufactured or incorporated into or attached to other tangible personal property to be transported outside the State and thereafter used by the purchaser solely outside the State. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1752(21), as amended by 2019 Me. H.P. 1294, effective Sept. 19, 2019. BNA-SUTN ME 4.3.3.
