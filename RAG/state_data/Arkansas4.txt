Depends Sales of aircraft are subject to tax. However, sales tax is not due if the gross receipts of an aircraft sale is less than $2,000. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-505; Ark. Regs. GR-14(A). “Aircraft” is defined as “any contrivance now known or hereafter invented, used, or designed for navigation of or flight in the air, except a parachute or other contrivance designed for such navigation but used primarily as safety equipment. Ark. Code Ann. §27-114-101(3). Aircraft equipped or designed for a specific non-transportation purpose, such as crop dusting, will still be treated as “aircraft” for sales and use tax purposes. Arkansas Revenue Legal Counsel Opinion No. 20160701 (Aug. 2, 2016). Aircraft sales in Arkansas are exempt from sales and use tax if the aircraft is sold by a person that is a resident of another state and if the purchaser will base the aircraft outside of Arkansas. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-451(a), as added by 2015 Ark. H.B. 1662, effective June 1, 2015; Ark. Regs. GR-14(F). This exemption applies even if an out-of-state purchaser takes possession in Arkansas, if the purchaser keeps the aircraft at a maintenance facility in the state and the aircraft is removed from the state upon completion of maintenance or if the purchaser takes possession of the aircraft for the sole purposes of removing the aircraft from Arkansas under its own power. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-451(b), as added by 2015 Ark. H.B. 1662, effective June 1, 2015; Ark. Regs. GR-14(F). Aircraft to be Based Outside of Arkansas (Fly-away) Additionally, effective Aug. 1, 2017, aircraft sales are exempt from sales and use tax if: • the seller is in Arkansas; • the aircraft has a certified maximum take-off weight of more than 9,500 pounds;and • will be based outside of Arkansas. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-451(a)(2), as added by 2017 Ark. H.B. 2278, effective March 23, 2017. Such aircraft will be exempt even if possession of the aircraft is taken in Arkansas for the sole purpose of removing the aircraft from Arkansas under its own power. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-451(a)(2), as added by 2017 Ark. H.B. 2278, effective March 23, 2017. Prior to Aug. 1, 2017, such aircraft sales are taxable. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-451(a). A vendor is only liable for collecting county sales and use tax on the first $2,500 of gross receipts, gross proceeds, or sales price on the sale of aircraft. Ark. Code Ann. §26-73-301(a)(2); Ark. Code Ann. §26-74-220(a)(2)(B); Ark. Code Ann. §26-74-320(a)(2)(B); Ark. Code Ann. §26-74-412(a)(1)(B)(ii); Ark. Code Ann. §26-74-612. Trade-ins If the seller takes used aircraft for a trade-in credit or part payment of a sale of another aircraft, tax is due on the difference between the total gross receipts or gross proceeds for the aircraft sold and credit given for the traded-in aircraft. Trade-in credits are only allowed for used aircraft that are taken in trade. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-505(b); see Arkansas Revenue Legal Counsel Opinion No. 20160916 (April 18, 2017). Leases Any person engaged in the business of selling aircraft in Arkansas who holds aircraft for resale in stock may rent or use the aircraft in a charter service operated by that person for a period of one year from the date of purchase of the aircraft without remitting the tax on the aircraft that is used. Also, if the aircraft purchased for resale requires substantial modification or substantial refurbishing prior to resale, the purchaser may use the aircraft in a rental or charter business for two years before tax is due. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-409; Ark. Regs. GR-14(E). In order to qualify for this exemption for resale, the purchaser must hold a retail sales tax permit at the time of purchase. See Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 19-272 (July 10, 2019). The purchaser must collect gross receipts and 1 percent short-term rental tax on all non-charter rentals. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-409(a); Ark. Regs. GR-14(E)(1). If an aircraft is rented by an aircraft charter service with a pilot's service included, the rental of aircraft and pilot service is a non-taxable service. Ark. Regs. GR-14(E)(2). If the aircraft is rented for a period of less than 30 days, then the sales tax and the short-term rental tax must be collected on the rental charge. Ark. Regs. GR-14(E)(2). If the aircraft is rented for 30 days or more, then the tax must be collected and remitted upon the rental charges unless the Arkansas tax was paid on the purchase price of the aircraft. Ark. Regs. GR-14(E)(2). BNA-SUTN AR 29.1.1.

Depends Sales of aircraft are subject to tax. However, sales tax is not due if the gross proceeds or gross receipts of an aircraft sales is less than$2,000. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-505; Ark. Regs. GR-14(A). “Aircraft”is defined as “any contrivance now known or hereafter invented, used, or designed for navigation of or flight in the air, except a parachute or other contrivance designed for such navigation but used primarily as safety equipment. Ark. Code Ann. §27-114-101(3). In addition, aircraft brought into the state only for refurbishing, conversion, or modification and not used or intended for use in the state are exempt from use tax if the aircraft is removed from the state within 60 days. Ark. Code Ann. § 26-53-115. Arkansas also exempts the sale of new aircraft manufactured or substantially completed within the state when sold by the manufacturer or substantial completer to a purchaser for use exclusively outside the state, notwithstanding the fact that possession may be taken in the state for the sole purpose of removing the aircraft from the state. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-505(c). Sale of Aircraft For Parts The Office of Revenue Legal Counsel has determined that the sale in Arkansas between an out-of-state buyer and seller of a commercial aircraft that is to be dismantled for its usable parts (primarily the engines) is exempt from sales and use tax. Arkansas Revenue Legal Counsel Opinion No. 20170630 (July 3, 2017); Arkansas Revenue Legal Counsel Opinion No. 20171107 (Jan. 8, 2018) (same facts). Pursuant toArk. Code Ann. §26-52-401(28)(A), Arkansas exempts parts or other tangible personal property that are incorporated into or become a part of commercial jet aircraft components or subcomponents. The Office of Revenue Legal Counsel opinion explains that the exemption applies to commercial jet aircraft parts or components whether such parts or components are sold in a container or in the form of a complete aircraft that is delivered for dismantling. In this instance, the true object of the purchaser is not to buy an aircraft, but rather to acquire the reusable parts and components for incorporation into another commercial jet aircraft component. Moreover, the storage at an Arkansas maintenance facility of the aircraft's unusable parts having a de minimis value does not defeat the application of the exemption. Arkansas Revenue Legal Counsel Opinion No. 20170630 (July 3, 2017); Arkansas Revenue Legal Counsel Opinion No. 20171107 (Jan. 8, 2018) (same facts). A commercial jet aircraft means a commercial, military, private, or other turbine or turbo jet aircraft having a certified maximum take-off weight of 12,500 pounds or more. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-401(28)(B). Trade-ins When a used aircraft is taken in trade as a credit or partial payment on the sale of a new or used aircraft, tax is levied on the net difference between the total consideration of the new or used aircraft being sold and the credit for the used aircraft taken in trade. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-505(b); see Arkansas Revenue Legal Counsel Opinion No. 20160916 (April 18, 2017). Leases Any person engaged in the business of selling aircraft in Arkansas who holds aircraft for resale in stock may rent or use the aircraft in a charter service operated by that person for a period of one year from the date of purchase of the aircraft without remitting the tax on the aircraft that is used. Also, if the aircraft purchased for resale requires substantial modification or substantial refurbishing prior to resale, the purchaser may use the aircraft in a rental or charter business for two years before tax is due. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-409; Ark. Regs. GR-14(E). “Modification” or “refurbishing”is defined as “the repair, replacement, or restoration of components, parts, or equipment affixed to or which are part of the aircraft.” Ark. Regs. GR-14(E)(1)(a). “Substantial” is defined as “any repair, replacement, or restoration that costs 50 percent or more of the fair market value of the aircraft prior to the modification or refurbishing.” Ark. Regs. GR-14(E)(1)(b). In order to qualify for this exemption for resale, the purchaser must hold a retail sales tax permit at the time of purchase. See Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 19-272 (July 10, 2019). The purchaser must collect gross receipts and 1 percent short-term rental tax on all non-charter rentals. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-409(a); Ark. Regs. GR-14(E)(1). If the aircraft is rented for a period of less than 30 days, then the sales tax and the short-term rental tax must be collected on the rental charge. Ark. Regs. GR-14(E)(2). If the aircraft is rented for 30 days or more, then the tax must be collected and remitted upon the rental charges unless the Arkansas tax was paid on the purchase price of the aircraft. Ark. Regs. GR-14(E)(2). BNA-SUTN AR 29.2.1.

Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Motor Vehicles, Intrastate or Non-Commercial Use Purchase, Lease, or Rental Transactions

Taxable Arkansas imposes the gross receipts tax and compensating use tax upon the sale of new and used motor vehicles, trailers, and semitrailers. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-510(a)(1); Ark. Code Ann. §26-53-126(a)(1). Unlike the gross receipts tax on other items, the consumer is responsible for paying the gross receipts tax on motor vehicles, trailers, and semitrailers. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-510(a)(1); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-296 (Oct. 23, 2018) (consumer remains liable even if dealer promises to pay for the tax). For vehicles required to be licensed with the Motor Vehicle Commission, the customer must pay the tax directly to the Commission. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-510(a)(1); Arkansas Revenue Legal Counsel Opinion No. 20170602 (Aug. 2, 2018). However, the gross receipts and compensating use taxes are not due on sales of motor vehicles, trailers, or semitrailers for less than $4,000. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-510(b)(1)(B), as amended by 2011 Ark. S.B. 274, effective Jan. 1, 2012; Ark. Code Ann. §26-53-126(b)(2). A “motor vehicle”is defined as “a vehicle that is self-propelled and is required to be registered for use on the highway.” Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-103(20); Ark. Code Ann. §26-53-102(7). ATVs, three wheelers, four wheelers, motorized bicycles are not required to be registered for highway use. Neither are mopeds, motorcycles, and motor-driven cycles designed for use exclusively in competitions or off-road. Ark. Regs. GR-12; see Arkansas Revenue Legal Counsel Opinion No. 20161101 (April 17, 2017). Therefore tax is due on the value of such vehicles without regard for the $4,000 motor vehicle threshold. Ark. Regs. GR-12; Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-237 (Feb. 28, 2018). For sales occurring prior to Jan. 1, 2012, the gross receipts and compensating use tax was not due on sales of motor vehicles, trailers, or semitrailers for less than $2,500. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-510(b)(1)(B), as amended by 2011 Ark. S.B. 274, effective Jan. 1, 2012. The transfer of title or possession of a motor vehicle triggers sales tax liability and discontinued possession of a vehicle does not negate sales tax liability. Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 19-152 (Nov. 16, 2018) (lack of possession of a motor vehicle when temporary registration expired is not a defense to sales tax liability); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 19-154 (Nov. 6, 2018) (sales tax as still owed on vehicle that was not registered and returned to seller); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 19-071 (Nov. 5, 2018) (sales tax as still owed on vehicle that taxpayer failed to timely register and later returned to seller); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 19-091 (Nov. 1, 2018) (sales tax as still owed on vehicle that was not registered by taxpayer and was returned to seller within a few days); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 19-109 (Oct. 30, 2018) (taxpayer still liable for sales tax on purchased motor vehicle even though taxpayer did not register vehicle and vehicle was later repossessed); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-438 (July 25, 2018) (taxpayer is liable for sales tax on purchased motor vehicle even if the taxpayer is unable to utilize the vehicle due to mechanical issues and the vehicle is ultimately left at the dealership); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-364 (June 12, 2018) (failure of dealership to transfer title is not a defense against payment of sales tax); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-316 (June 11, 2018) (purchaser still liable for sales tax on vehicle which was stolen and totaled before expiration of 30 day period); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-239 (March 28, 2018) (sales tax was still owed on vehicle that was not registered and later returned to the seller); see Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-323 (May 31, 2018) (tax still owed on motor vehicle that became inoperable immediately after transfer of possession and was never registered); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-335 (May 30, 2018) (purchaser still liable for sales tax on vehicle even though he never received the title from the dealer). Even if a motor vehicle is later totalled and repossessed, a purchaser owes sales tax on the purchase of a vehicle. Additionally, even if a purchaser does not register a motor vehicle and it is later repossessed or taken subject to a mechanic's lien, tax is due on the purchase. Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 19-071 (Nov. 5, 2018); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 19-0109 (Oct. 30, 2018); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-439 (Aug. 29, 2018); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-425 (Aug. 28, 2018); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 19-003 (Aug. 15, 2018); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-411 (Aug. 10, 2018); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-418 (July 19, 2018); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-334 (May 22, 2018); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-296 (April 12, 2018); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-185 (March 5, 2018); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-181 (Feb. 9, 2018). A seller's repossession of a vehicle does not negate a buyer's sales tax liability. Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 19-226 (Jan. 14, 2019). Additionally, if a motor vehicle is later stolen, impounded, and then repossessed, a purchaser owes sales tax on the purchase of a vehicle. Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-147 (Feb. 1, 2018). Where a purchaser buys a motor vehicle, but claims, without any evidence, that the dealer never issued a title, the taxpayer is still liable for tax. Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-432 (July 16, 2018). Where a purchaser claims that a sale of a vehicle was rescinded, but has no documentation that the rescission took place, the taxpayer is still liable for sales tax on the purchase. Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 19-091 (Nov. 1, 2018) (taxpayer still liable for sales tax although taxpayer claimed seller rescinded sale and provided partial refund of down payment of vehicle); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 19-040 (Sept. 14, 2018) (claimed discontinued possession of a car that a taxpayer co-purchased with another person does not relieve the taxpayer of liability); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-436 (Aug. 28, 2018); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-424 (Aug. 22, 2018); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-101 (Nov. 27, 2017); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-126 (Nov. 7, 2017). Items that are affixed to a trailer qualify as components of the trailer whose cost must be included in the gross proceeds for the trailer purchase, while loose items that are not incorporated into the trailer represent separate purchases under the contract whose cost should not be included in the cost of the trailer purchase. Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 17-517 (May 24, 2018). Special Mobile Equipment Special mobile equipment is exempt from the registration requirement and, unless otherwise exempt, sales tax must be paid on the equipment directly to the retailer. Special mobile equipment is defined as a “vehicle not designed or used primarily for the transportation of persons or property,” and is only incidentally operated or moved over the highways. Examples include farm tractors, road construction or maintenance machinery, a ditch-digging apparatus, a well-boring apparatus, or a concrete mixer. Ark. Code Ann. §27-14-703(4); Arkansas Revenue Legal Counsel Opinion No. 20170602 (Aug. 2, 2018) (a water truck is not special mobile equipment, but a towable generator and a towable light tower are). Motor Vehicle Trade-ins When a used motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer is sold by a consumer, rather than traded-in as a credit on the sale of a new motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer, and the consumer purchases a new motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer within 45 days of the sale of the used one, the consumer is taxed on the net difference between the total consideration for the new or used vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer and the amount received for the sale of the previous used vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-510(b)(1)(C)(i). See, e.g., Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-377A (Nov. 1, 2018) (the seller is entitled to the credit where the seller has a signed statement from the buyer along with contemporaneous evidence establishing that the date of the second sale was within 45 days of sale of previous vehicle); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-413 (Aug. 16, 2018) (45 day time period is an absolute requirement and does not take into account unusual or exigent circumstances); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 19-012 (Aug. 8, 2018) and Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-377 (July 20, 2018) (where taxpayer has 2 bills of sale with contradictory dates, taxpayer has not demonstrated entitlement to motor vehicle tax credit); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-213 (March 28, 2018) (denying credit where new vehicle was purchased more than 45 days after previous vehicle was sold); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 17-148 (Dec. 6, 2016); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 17-050 (Oct. 4, 2016); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 16-313 (April 19, 2016). To qualify for the trade-in credit, the vehicle must be the type of vehicle required to be licensed and registered for use on public streets and highways. Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 19-347 (April 22, 2019) (ATV's do not qualify for the motor vehicle tax credit). If the vehicle purchased by the consumer costs less than the proceeds received from the vehicle sold by the consumer in lieu of a trade-in, the consumer will not owe sales tax on his or her newly purchased vehicle. However, the credit will not exceed the price paid by the consumer for the newly purchased vehicle. Ark. Regs. GR-12.1(C); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-315 (April 23, 2018). To qualify for the sales tax credit, the same person or entity must be both the seller of the previous used vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer and the purchaser of the new or used vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer. Individuals, partnerships, limited liability companies, limited liability partnerships, corporations, estates, trusts, fiduciaries, and any other legal entities are all considered separate entities for the purpose of this exemption. Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 19-167 (Jan. 11, 2019); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-084 (Oct. 16, 2017); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 17-050 (Oct. 4, 2016); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 16-400 (April 26, 2016); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 16-270 (April 1, 2016); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 16-214 (March 22, 2016). However, the party to whom the previous vehicle's title is transferred to must be independent from the seller. Ark. Regs. GR-12.1; Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-188 (Feb. 28, 2018) (denying a trade-in credit where all the relevant transactions were carried out by incorporators or organizers of the same corporation); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-073 (March 23, 2018) (title alone is not dispositive of ownership); see also Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 19-165 (Jan. 8, 2019) (vehicle transferred to a trust was owned by the trust even though the vehicle's title was not changed). The consumer must provide a completed bill of sale to the department which contains the name and address of the seller and purchaser, description of the vehicle and VIN, sales price, and date of sale. Ark. Regs. GR-12.1(D)(1)(a); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 19-238 (Jan. 9, 2019) (proof that the vehicle was registered in the purchaser's name is not required, only a properly completed bill of sale). The sales tax credit is not available to persons who trade their vehicle to other persons or organizations for debt forgiveness. Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 16-317 (Aug. 23, 2016). Because Ark. Regs. GR-12.1(B)(3) defines a “sale”as an exchange of title for “cash or the equivalent of cash,”a seller who exchanges title for a promissory note is only eligible to take the credit to the extent of actual payments received rather than the entire value of the note. Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-250 (June 12, 2018); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 19-124 (Jan. 3, 2019). A consumer does not qualify for the sales tax credit if the used vehicle is “totaled” in a car accident, and title is transferred to the insurance company in exchange for a financial settlement or other amount due under an insurance policy. This is not considered a sale by a consumer to another buyer. Ark. Regs. GR-12.1; Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 19-268 (March 12, 2019) (the credit is not available in such a transaction because insurance proceeds are not sale proceeds); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 17-301 (April 21, 2017). For situations involving a discrepancy as to whether the signatures are the same on the vehicle's title and the bill of sale, the Office of Hearings and Appeals has upheld a fraud penalty in at least one instance. Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 16-385 (June 17, 2016). For special orders, if a used vehicle is sold after placing the special order for a new vehicle and the new vehicle is not delivered until after 45 days from the sale of the used vehicle, then the 45-day deadline is met if the sale of the used vehicle occurs within 45 days of placing a binding order for a new vehicle. Ark. Regs. GR-12.1(G); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 17-406 (July 5, 2017) (where taxpayer had addition of utility beds to trucks that was not a contractual condition of the taxpayer's purchase of the vehicles, date of purchase rather than date of delivery controls for when 45-day count starts). If the vehicle sold by the consumer in lieu of a trade-in is sold prior to the time the consumer registers and pays sales tax on his or her newly purchased vehicle, a bill of sale for the vehicle sold must be submitted to the Revenue Office at the time the newly purchased vehicle is registered. Ark. Regs. GR-12.1(D)(1); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 17-381 (July 12, 2017). A consumer who fails to submit a bill of sale at the time the newly purchased vehicle is registered is not entitled to a sales tax credit on a prior sale of a vehicle. Ark. Regs. GR-12.1(D)(1); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 17-381 (July 12, 2017); see also Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 19-049 (Oct. 4, 2018) (bill of sale which lacked information regarding the seller and was not signed was insufficient), reversed in part on other grounds by Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 19-49 (May 20, 2019) (reversing the Oct. 4, 2018 decision in part by stating penalties were applicable to an erroneously claimed credit). Where a taxpayer purchases a motor vehicle with funds supplied from a company and then transfers title of the vehicle to that company for no contemporaneous transfer of consideration, the taxpayer may not take a sales tax credit on a subsequent purchase of a second vehicle for the “sale” of the first vehicle. See, e.g., Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 17-456 (Oct. 24, 2017). Where a seller withholds a vehicle title until the sales price is fully paid, the date the seller provides title to the buyer is considered the date the sale occurs, even though a bill of sale generally indicates the transfer of title for a vehicle. Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 19-211 (Jan. 3, 2019); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-396 (July 12, 2018). Service Contracts for Motor Vehicles Service contracts, maintenance agreements and extended warranties, which in whole or in part provide for the future performance of or payment for taxable services are subject to gross receipts tax. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-301(7); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 17-530 (Aug. 9, 2017). The seller of the contract must collect and remit the tax due on the sale of the contract except when the contract is sold simultaneously with a motor vehicle in which case the purchaser of the vehicle must pay gross receipts tax on the purchase of the contract at the time of vehicle registration.

Ark. Regs. GR-34(A). The gross receipts or gross proceeds derived from the sale of motor vehicles licensed for use on the highways for use exclusively by volunteer crews or squads for life saving, first aid or other rescue activities, including volunteer fire departments, are exempt from tax if:• the person, firm, or corporation desiring to claim this exemption obtains an application for registration and license from the Office of Motor Vehicle Registration, Division of Revenue, Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration;and • the vehicle is painted a distinguishing color and conspicuously displays in letters and figures not less than three inches tall the identity of the volunteer lifesaving or first aid crew or rescue squad using such vehicle. Ark. Regs. GR-34(D). The gross receipts or gross proceeds derived from the sale of a motor vehicle to a person engaged in the business of renting licensed motor vehicles is exempt from sales and use tax if the person has a rental exemption certificate and retail sales tax permit issued by the department and the motor vehicle is titled and registered in the name of the person holding the rental certificate. Ark. Regs. GR-12(D). Long-Term Motor Vehicle Leases As of July 1, 2015, the 1.5 percent long-term rental vehicle tax has been rescinded and no longer applies. Arkansas State Revenue Tax Quarterly 2016-1. On and after Oct. 1, 2013, a long-term lessor of motor vehicles may purchase the vehicles exempt from tax as a sale for resale, and collect sales tax on subsequent rental payments. Prior to Oct. 1, 2013, a long-term lessor of motor vehicles had the option to remit the tax on the purchase price of the motor vehicle at the time of registration. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-103(26)(D)(ii), as amended by 2013 Ark. S.B. 688, effective Oct. 1, 2013; Arkansas Revenue Legal Counsel Opinion No. 20180731 (Aug. 7, 2018); Ark. Regs. GR-20(D)(1). If sales tax was paid in full at the time of registration prior to Oct. 1, 2013, the lessor is not required to collect sales tax on rental payments made after Oct. 1, 2013 so long as the lessor continues to lease the vehicle on a long-term basis. Arkansas Revenue Legal Counsel Opinion No. 20180731 (Aug. 7, 2018) (no sales tax due on lease payments for vehicle leased on Sept. 19, 2013 The lessor also does not need to collect tax on the lease of a motor vehicle that had been previously titled and registered in another state by the lessor, so long as the sales or use tax was paid to that state on the purchase price of the vehicle and the total tax paid is equal to or greater than the Arkansas state and local use tax that would have applied to the vehicle. Ark. Regs. GR-20(D)(2). If a motor vehicle is initially leased to a resident of another state and the lessee later becomes a resident of Arkansas during the term of the lease, and if no tax was paid to another state when the vehicle was registered, then the lessor must pay state and local use tax on the stated invoice price of the motor vehicle and not collect sales or long-term rental tax from the lessee. If tax was paid to another state and the motor vehicle was first registered in another state, then the lessor is entitled to credit against the Arkansas use tax for taxes paid to the other state, and pay the balance due, if any. Ark. Regs. GR-20(D)(5). Trade in deductions that apply to purchases of motor vehicles do not apply to lease transactions. Ark. Regs. GR-20(D)(2)(b). The gross receipts must be reported and remitted regardless of whether the payments are timely made, and assignment of the lease agreement does not relieve the lessor from the obligations to remit the tax. The lessor's obligation to remit tax ends at either the expiration of the lease or the valid termination of the lease. Ark. Regs. GR-20(D)(3)(a). Obligation will also end if a motor vehicle is initially leased to an Arkansas resident and the lessee later becomes a resident of another state during the term of the lease, as the lessor would no longer be required to collect and remit Arkansas sales tax and long-term rental tax on the remainder of the monthly lease payments. The lessor must maintain records that accurately reflect that the motor vehicle is no longer leased to an Arkansas resident. Ark. Regs. GR-20(D)(5)(a). However, if a motor vehicle is initially leased to a resident of another state and the lessee later becomes a resident of Arkansas during the term of the lease, then the lessor must begin collecting and reporting Arkansas tax if no tax was paid to the another state when the vehicle was initially registered. Ark. Regs. GR-20(D)(5)(b). An initial payment on the lease in the form of money or by transferring ownership of another motor vehicle is still included in gross receipts and subject to tax. Ark. Regs. GR-20(D)(5). County Sales and Use Tax Limitations A vendor is only liable for collecting county sales and use tax on the first $2,500 of gross receipts, gross proceeds, or sales price on the sale of a motor vehicle.

Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Motor Vehicles, Intrastate or Non-Commercial Use Fuel

Taxable Sales of fuel oil, motor oil, and lubricants are subject to tax unless an exemption applies. Ark. Regs. GR-29. Motor Vehicle Fuel Gross receipts or gross proceeds derived from the sale of gasoline or motor vehicle fuel on which the motor vehicle fuel or gasoline tax has been paid to Arkansas is exempt from gross receipts tax. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-401(11)(A)(i). Motor fuel means all products commonly or commercially known or sold as gasoline regardless of their classification or uses. This includes casinghead, absorption, and natural gasoline and condensate when used without blending as a motor fuel or sod for use in motors directly or sold to those who blend for their own use. Ark. Code Ann. §26-55-202(7). The term “motor fuel” does not include the following:• casinghead, absorption, and natural gasoline and condensate when sold to be blended or compounded with other less volatile liquids in the manufacture of commercial gasoline for motor fuel; • leaded gasoline with an octane rating of 110 or higher used solely for off-highway testing; or • oil that is normally sold for cooking purposes and purchased from retail outlets, or used cooking oil recycled and gathered from restaurants and commercial food processors. Ark. Code Ann. §26-55-202(7)(C). Despite the above mentioned exemption, gasoline is still subject to the wholesale gross receipts tax. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-401(11)(B). BNA-SUTN AR 29.3.6.

Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Motor Vehicles, Intrastate or Non-Commercial Use Short-term Motor Vehicle Rentals

Taxable Passenger car rentals are subject to the state of Arkansas gross receipts and compensating use tax. Ark. Regs. GR-20(D)(1); Ark. Regs. GR-20(F)(1). All short-term rentals of motor vehicles, including diesel trucks, are subject to state and local gross receipts tax regardless of whether tax was paid on the vehicle at registration. Ark. Regs. GR-20(E). In addition to the state and local gross receipts tax, every person in the business of renting licensed motor vehicles in Arkansas must collect rental vehicle tax on short-term rentals of licensed motor vehicles. The rate of the rental vehicle tax is equal to 10 percent plus a local rental vehicle tax equal to the sales tax rate of the city and county in which the lessor's business is located. A lessor with no physical business location must collect the city and county portion of the rental vehicle tax based on the city and county in which the lessee resides. The rental vehicle tax does not apply to rentals of diesel trucks for commercial shipping;semi-trailers, trailers or other non-motor vehicles; and farm machinery or equipment. Ark. Code Ann. §26-63-302; Ark. Regs. GR-20(E)(1). If tangible personal property is rented with an operator's services included, the rental of the property and operator service is a non-taxable service, so long as the service alone would have been exempt from tax. Ark. Regs. GR-20(F). Commercial truck leases of 30 days or more for interstate transportation of goods are not taxable. Ark. Code Ann. § 26-52-401(32). The lessor must retain records for at least six years that establish the rental history of each vehicle including copies of written contracts with the lessee and mileage incurred on the vehicle by each lessee. Failure to adequately document the exclusive use of the vehicle for rentals will constitute a presumption that the vehicle was not exclusively used for rentals resulting in the revocation of the sales tax exemption claimed at the time of registration of the vehicle.

Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Motor Vehicles, Interstate and Common Carrier Purchase, Lease, or Rental Transactions

Depends With the exception of certain semitrailers and class six and class seven trucks engaged in interstate commerce, Arkansas imposes its gross receipts tax and compensating use tax on new and used motor vehicles, trailers, and semitrailers. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-510(a)(1); Ark. Code Ann. §26-53-126(a)(1); Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-436(d); Ark. Code Ann. §26-53-144(d); Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-436(c); Ark. Code Ann. §26-53-144(c). Unlike the gross receipts tax on other items, the consumer is responsible for paying the gross receipts tax on motor vehicles, trailers, and semitrailers. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-510(a)(1); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-296 (Oct. 23, 2018) (consumer remains liable even if dealer promises to pay for the tax). For vehicles required to be licensed with the Motor Vehicle Commission, the customer must pay the tax directly to the Commission. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-510(a)(1); Arkansas Revenue Legal Counsel Opinion No. 20170602 (Aug. 2, 2018). However, the gross receipts and compensating use taxes are not due on sales of motor vehicles, trailers, or semitrailers for less than $4,000. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-510(b)(1)(B); Ark. Code Ann. §26-53-126(b)(2). Arkansas exempts from its gross receipts and compensating use tax the sale or use of a new or used class six or class seven truck as defined by Ark. Code Ann. §27-14-601(a)(3)(F) and Ark. Code Ann. §27-14-601(a)(3)(G) that is registered with the International Registration Plan to be engaged in interstate commerce. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-436(d); Ark. Code Ann. §26-53-144(d). Arkansas also exempts from its gross receipts and compensating use tax the sale or use of a new or used semitrailer. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-436(c); Ark. Code Ann. §26-53-144(c). “Semitrailer"means every vehicle with or without motive power, including a pole trailer, drawn by a truck tractor or a class six truck as defined by Ark. Code Ann. §27-14-601(a)(3)(F) or a class seven truck as defined by Ark. Code Ann. §27-14-601(a)(3)(G) that is registered with the International Registration Plan to be engaged in interstate commerce and designed for carrying property. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-436(a)(2); Ark. Code Ann. §26-53-144(a)(2). Arkansas imposes gross receipts tax and compensating use tax on only the first $9,150 paid for a new or used truck tractor. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-436(b); Ark. Code Ann. §26-53-144(b). This limitation does not apply to local taxes. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-436(e); Ark. Code Ann. §26-53-144(e). A “truck tractor”is a motor vehicle designed to draw another vehicle and not designed to carry a load directly and registered as a class five or eight truck by Ark. Code Ann. §27-14-601(a)(3), or a class six or seven truck, as designated by Ark. Code Ann. §27-14-601(a)(3), that is not registered with the International Registration Plan for interstate commerce. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-436(a)(3); Ark. Code Ann. §26-53-144(a)(3). Special Mobile Equipment Special mobile equipment is exempt from the registration requirement and, unless otherwise exempt, sales tax must be paid on the equipment directly to the retailer. Special mobile equipment is defined as a “vehicle not designed or used primarily for the transportation of persons or property,” and is only incidentally operated or moved over the highways. Examples include farm tractors, road construction or maintenance machinery, a ditch-digging apparatus, a well-boring apparatus, or a concrete mixer. Ark. Code Ann. §27-14-703(4); Arkansas Revenue Legal Counsel Opinion No. 20170602 (Aug. 2, 2018) (a water truck is not special mobile equipment, but a towable generator and a towable light tower are). Motor Vehicle Trade-ins When a used motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer is sold by a consumer, rather than traded-in as a credit on the sale of a new motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer, and the consumer purchases a new motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer within 45 days of the sale of the used one, the consumer is taxed on the net difference between the total consideration for the new or used vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer and the amount received for the sale of the previous used vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-510(b)(1)(C)(i). See, e.g., Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-413 (Aug. 16, 2018) (45 day time period is an absolute requirement and does not take into account unusual or exigent circumstances); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-213 (March 28, 2018) (denying credit where new vehicle was purchased more than 45 days after previous vehicle was sold); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-238 (March 6, 2018) (taxpayer was not entitled to a trade-in sales tax credit because 69 days had elapsed between their purchase of a new vehicle, and his sale of a used vehicle); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 17-148 (Dec. 6, 2016); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 16-313 (April 19, 2016); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 17-003 (Aug. 25, 2016) (taxpayer was unable to claim a trade-in sales tax credit because 46 days had elapsed between their purchase of a new vehicle, and their sale of a used vehicle). To qualify for the sales tax credit, the same person or entity must be both the seller of the previous used vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer and the purchaser of the new or used vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer. Individuals, partnerships, limited liability companies, limited liability partnerships, corporations, estates, trusts, fiduciaries, and any other legal entities are all considered separate entities for the purpose of this exemption.
