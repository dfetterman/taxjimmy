Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Prepared Food Definition of 'Prepared Food'

Defined All food sold in a heated state and all food sold with eating utensils is prepared food subject to sales tax. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-04.1(2)(d)(1). When a seller mixes two or more food ingredients together for sale as a single item, it will be prepared food unless it• is sold by weight or volume (i.e., pound, ounce, quart, gallon, etc.), or • is a bakery item. North Dakota Sales Tax Newsletter December 2009. Raw food that requires cooking to make it safe to eat or food that is only cut, repackaged or pasteurized by the seller is not prepared food and is exempt from tax. North Dakota Sales Tax Newsletter December 2009. North Dakota defines the term “prepared food” as:• food sold in a heated state or heated by the seller; N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-04.1(2)(d)(1). • two or more food ingredients mixed or combined by the seller for sale as a single item; N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-04.1(2)(d)(2). or • food sold with eating utensils provided by the seller, including plates, knives, forks, spoons, glasses, cups, napkins, or straws. A plate does not include a container or packaging used to transport the food. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-04.1(2)(d)(3). However, “prepared food” does not include:• food that is only cut, repackaged, or pasteurized by the seller; N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-04.1(2)(e)(1). • eggs, fish, meat, poultry, or foods containing those raw animal foods that requiring cooking by the consumer to prevent foodborne illness; N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-04.1(2)(e)(2). or • if sold without eating utensils provided by the seller; ○ food sold by a seller whose proper primary North American industry classification system classification is manufacturing in sector 311; N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-04.1(2)(e)(3)(a). ○ food sold in an unheated state by weight or volume as a single item; N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-04.1(2)(e)(3)(b). ○ bakery items, including bread, rolls, buns, biscuits, bagels, croissants, pastries, donuts, Danish, cakes, tortes, pies, tarts, muffins, bars, cookies, and tortillas; N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-04.1(2)(e)(3)(c). and ○ food sold that ordinarily requires additional cooking, as opposed to just reheating, by the consumer prior to consumption. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-04.1(2)(e)(3)(d), as amended by 2015 N.D. H.B. 1406, effective April 24, 2015. Prepared Food Percentage The Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board has adopted a 75-percent threshold test to determine when utensils are provided by a seller, and thus when a sale is a taxable sale of prepared food. In calculating the ratio, the numerator is determined by adding the sales of prepared food with the number of sales where utensils, plates, bowls, cups, or cutlery are necessary to receive the food. Alcoholic beverages are not included in the numerator. The denominator includes all sales of food and food ingredients, as well as prepared food, candy, soft drinks, and dietary supplements. Again, alcohol is not included within this sum. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-04.1(3)(a). If, after the calculation is complete, the ratio is 75 percent or less, then utensils are considered provided to the customer only where it is the vendors practice to physically give, hand, or otherwise deliver, the utensils to the customer. The vendors practice is determined by accepting a good faith representation from the vendor. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-04.1(3)(b). If, after the calculation is complete, the ratio is greater than 75 percent, then utensils are considered to be provided so long as utensils are made available to the purchaser. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-04.1(3)(c). For vendors who have a ratio of greater than 75 percent who sell items containing four or more servings packaged as one and sold for one price, the mere availability of utensils does not make such food prepared food. Rather, if the vendor provides utensils directly for use in consuming the food item, then the food is considered prepared food, and subject to tax as such. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-04.1(3)(c). If a seller sells food items that have a utensil placed in a package by a person other than the seller, and the person who placed the utensils in the package is classified as a manufacturer under the North American Industry Classification System, the retailer will not be considered to have provided the utensils to the customer. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-04.1(3)(d). Each person or business engaged in the business of selling food and prepared food must calculate their prepared food ratio annually. The ratio must be determined no later than ninety days after the end of the year, and must be based on the retailer's previous year data. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-04.1(3)(e). The prepared food ratio is to be used for all of the retailer's locations within the state. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-04.1(3)(f). If the business is a new business, it must make a good faith estimate of its prepared food ratio for its first year of business. However, if after the first three months of being in business the retailer learns that the good faith effort is materially different than their actual prepared food ratio, the ratio must be recalculated.
