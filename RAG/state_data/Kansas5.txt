Three-part Test In general, when tangible personal property is affixed to real property, the sale of the property will be subject to tax when the property is purchased by the party installing or affixing the property to real property and not on the sale to the ultimate purchaser. Kan. City Millwright Co. v. Kalb, 562 P.2d 65 (Kan. 1977) (citing Dodge City Water & Light Co. v. Alfalfa Land & Irrigation Co., 67 P. 462 (Kan. 1902). The Kansas courts have composed a three-part test to determine whether or not tangible personal property has become a fixture. The first prong of the test requires that the tangible personal property be annexed to the real property in some manner. The second prong of the test requires that the tangible personal property be an essential part of the use of the real property to which it is connected. Finally, the courts consider the intention of the party affixing the tangible personal property, and whether the party had intended to make the tangible personal property a permanent part of the real property. Kan. City Millwright Co. v. Kalb, 562 P.2d 65 (Kan. 1977) (citing Dodge City Water & Light Co. v. Alfalfa Land & Irrigation Co., 67 P. 462 (Kan. 1902). BNA-SUTN KS 28.2.1.

Regs. 92-19-66(a); Kansas Information Guide KS-1525; Kansas Information Guide EDU-26; Kansas Information Guide:Construction Contractors Self-Audit Fact Sheet.

Individuals who are primarily engaged in the business of selling at retail tangible personal property to the end user, but who also perform construction contracts, are entitled to purchase materials exempt from sales tax as a sale for resale. When the individual performs work under a construction contract, and, in doing so, removes from inventory materials to complete the job, the retailer must pay the appropriate amount of sales tax due on the materials withdrawn from inventory. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-66(c); Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-20-4; Kansas Information Guide KS-1525; Kansas Information Guide EDU-26. The tax rate is based on the location of the inventory.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Services to Real Property Real Property Installation

Depends Services performed to install or apply tangible personal property are exempt from sales tax when the services involve the original construction, reconstruction, restoration, remodeling, renovation, repair or replacement of a residence. Kan. Admin. Regs. § 92-19-66b; Kansas Information Guide KS-1525. Kansas provides an exemption for the service of installing tangible personal property in connection with the “original construction” of a new building or facility. This exemption includes an addition of an entire room or floor and the completion of any portion of an existing building. See, e.g., Kansas Private Letter Ruling P-2002-056 (June 25, 2002) (landscaping for pond exempt because pond installed with original building construction). But see Kansas Opinion Letter O-2001-114 (Oct. 24, 2001) (the residential repair and remodeling exemption does not apply to pest application services even though they may be applied with the original building construction); Kansas Private Letter Ruling P-2004-019 (June 17, 2004). The exemption also extends to the construction or repair of a bridge or highway, and the restoration or replacement of buildings or facilities as a result of certain weather events, explosions, or terrorism. Kansas Information Guide KS-1525. An eligible “facility” includes a mill, plant, refinery, oil, or gas well and property belonging to cooperative nonprofit corporations and municipal corporations. Kan. Stat. Ann. § 79-3603(p); Kan. Admin. Regs. § 92-19-66b. Prior to April 15, 1995, original construction labor services were taxed at a 2.5 percent rate. The transition rules applicable to original construction services that were performed prior to April 15, 1995 are provided in Kansas Public Notice 016229 (April 27, 1995). The Kansas Court of Appeals has found that the installation of built-in appliances constitutes the tax-exempt remodeling of real property. While the Kansas Department of Revenue disputed the characterization of the installation of built-in appliances such as dishwashers, garbage disposals, over-the-range microwave ovens, wall ovens, ranges, cook-tops, and range hoods as the remodeling or renovation of real property, the Kansas Court of Appeals found that such installation services are provided in connection with remodeling and renovation. In re Lowe's Home Ctrs, LLC., Kan. Ct. App., No. 115,254 (April 14, 2017). When adding an entire room or floor to the exterior of an existing commercial building, any replacement, remodeling, restoration, repair, renovation, or reconstruction done in the interior of an existing commercial building or facility is also considered to be original construction and exempt from sales tax, if:• the work would not be necessary except for the addition of the entire room or floor, • the work being done is necessary to support the addition of the new room, floor, or the machinery housed there, or • the support of the entire room or floor being added is the direct reason for the work done to the interior. Kan. Admin. Regs. § 92-19-66b; Kansas Information Guide KS-1525. Services performed to complete any unfinished portion of an existing commercial building or facility are original construction and exempt from sales tax only when all four of the following conditions are met:• the work was called for in the original blueprint, building plan or specification; • the completion of the unfinished portion is within a time reasonably requisite to the original construction of the building or facility; • the owner or occupant is the first or initial owner or occupant of the building or facility; and, • the work would have been performed at the time of original construction except for circumstances beyond the owner's control (i.e., unavailability of material, weather, death, or bankruptcy of the contractor). Kan. Admin. Regs. § 92-19-66b; Kansas Information Guide KS-1525. Original construction includes restoration, reconstruction or replacement of a building, facility or utility structure when the damage is the result of fire, flood, tornado, lightning, explosion, windstorm, ice loading and attendant winds, terrorism or earthquake. Restoration, repair or replacement work done on commercial property damaged by hail, ice, straight winds (other than windstorm or ice loading, as defined above), rain, snow, vandalism, age, deterioration, or any other cause is taxable. When performing labor services under this exemption, a taxpayer should obtain a notarized affidavit from the owner of the commercial building or facility stating that the damage was caused by one or more of these reasons. Often this type of work is documented with an insurance claim. Kan. Admin. Regs. § 92-19-66b; Kansas Information Guide KS-1525. Services to construct, reconstruct, restore, replace, or repair a bridge or highway in Kansas are considered original construction that is exempt from sales tax. A highway is any way or place used for public vehicular travel, but does not include any roadway or driveway on property owned by private owners or by colleges, universities, or other institutions. Services to install lighting or signs, or to seed or reseed right-of-ways adjacent to the road or bridge are exempt when performed in conjunction with bridge or highway work. Kansas Information Guide KS-1525. Additionally, no tax is imposed on installing tangible personal property in connection with the original construction, reconstruction, restoration, remodeling, renovation, repair or replacement of a residence. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3603(p). See, e.g., Kansas Private Letter Ruling P-2003-001 (Jan. 8, 2003). If a building is used for both residential and commercial purposes, charges for services must be allocated between the residential portion of the building, which is exempt, and the commercial portion of the building, which is generally taxable.
