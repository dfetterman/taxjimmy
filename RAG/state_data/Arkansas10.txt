Code Ann. §26-52-521(b) Under Arkansas law, retail sales of a product or service, other than a lease or rental, are sourced in the following manner:• if a product or service is received by a purchaser at the business location of a seller, the sale is sourced to that business location; • if a product or service is not received by a purchaser at the business location of the seller, the sale is sourced to the location where receipt of the property by the purchaser or the purchaser's designated donee occurs, including the location that is indicated by instruction for delivery to the purchaser or donee that is known to the seller; • if neither of the rules above apply, the sale is sourced to the location indicated by an address for the purchaser that is available from the business records of the seller that are maintained in the ordinary course of the seller's business, provided that the use of this address does not constitute bad faith; • if none of the rules above apply, the sale is sourced to the location that is indicated by the address for the purchaser that was obtained during the consummation of the sale, including the address of a purchaser's payment instrument in no other address is available and provided that the use of this address does not constitute bad faith; or • if none of the rules above apply, including circumstances in which a seller is without sufficient information to apply the above rules, the location of the sales is determined by the address from which tangible personal property was shipped or from which the service was provided, but disregarding for these purposes any location that merely provided the digital transfer of the product sold. As of Jan. 1, 2018, sales of specified digital products or digital codes are sourced to the location from which such products of codes were first available for transmission to the seller. Ark.
