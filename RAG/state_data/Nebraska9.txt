Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

Incidental-to-Service Test Nebraska applies the “incidental-to-service” test in determining the taxability of transactions involving both the performance of a service and the transfer of tangible personal property. Nebraska Revenue Ruling No. 01-08-6. The “incidental-to-service”test looks at the entire transaction to determine whether the transaction is the provision of a service or the transfer of tangible personal property. If it is determined that the transaction is the provision of a service, then any tangible personal property transferred is considered incidental to the services provided. The service provider must pay tax on the tangible personal property used to provide the service. Nebraska Revenue Ruling No. 01-08-6. The factors for the “incidental-to-service”test are the following six factors:• the object sought by the buyer; • the seller's type of business; • whether the tangible personal property was provided as a retail enterprise with a profit-making motive; • whether the tangible personal property could be sold without the service; • the extent that the services have contributed to the value of the tangible items transferred; and • any other factors relevant to the particular transaction. Nebraska Revenue Ruling No. 01-08-6. Additionally, blueprints, abstracts, law briefs and other similar documents furnished in connection with personal services in a professional capacity are not taxable when furnished as a part of the rendition of the personal service. Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-080.02. BNA-SUTN NE 9.3.1.

Receipts from the sale of bundled transactions are taxable when one or more of the products included in the bundle are taxable. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2701.48(1); Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-108.01. A bundled transaction does not include the sale of any products in which the sales price varies, or is negotiable, based on the selection by the purchaser of the products included in the transaction. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2701.48(1); Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-108; see also Nebraska Information Guide No. 6-437-2005. Distinct and identifiable products do not include:packaging such as containers, boxes, sacks, bags, and bottles or other materials such as wrapping, labels, tags, and instruction guides that accompany the retail sale of the products and are incidental or immaterial to the retail sale. Examples of packaging that are incidental or immaterial include grocery sacks, shoeboxes, dry cleaning garment bags, and express delivery envelopes and boxes. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2701.48(2)(a). A product provided free of charge with the required purchase of another product is also not a distinct and identifiable product. A product is provided free of charge if the sales price of the product purchased does not vary depending on the inclusion of the product provided free of charge. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2701.48(2)(b). Also, items included in the definition of sales price pursuant to Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2701.35, including the cost of the property sold, the cost of the materials used, the cost of the labor, losses, all costs of travel, charges by the seller for services necessary to complete the sale, delivery charges, and installation charges are not a distinct and identifiable product. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2701.48(2)(c).

Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2701.48(3). Transactions Not Considered Bundled Transactions A transaction that otherwise meets the definition of a bundled transaction is not a bundled transaction if the transaction is described by any one of the following statements:• the retail sale of tangible personal property and a service where the tangible personal property is essential to the use of the service, and is provided exclusively in connection with the service, and the true object of the transaction is the service. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2701.48(4)(a); see also Nebraska General Information Letter 1-14-1 (Nursing services accompanied by the transfer of microchip bracelets are not a bundled transaction, as the bracelets are merely part of the rendering of the service, not a retail sale. The taxpayer owes tax on the bracelets at the time of purchase, but the provision of the bracelets to patients is only a retail sale when nursing services are not provided.). • the retail sale of services where one service is provided that is essential to the use or receipt of a second service and the first service is provided exclusively in connection with the second service and the true object of the transaction is the second service. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2701.48(4)(b). • a transaction that includes taxable products and nontaxable products and the purchase price or sales price of the taxable products is de minimis. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2701.48(4)(c). o de minimis means the seller's purchase price or sales price of the taxable products is 10 percent or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled products. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2701.48(4)(c). o sellers must use either the purchase price or the sales price of the products to determine if the taxable products are de minimis. Sellers may not use a combination of the purchase price and sales price of the products to determine if the taxable products are de minimis. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2701.48(4)(c). o sellers must use the full term of a service contract to determine if the taxable products are de minimis. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2701.48(4)(c). • the retail sale of exempt tangible personal property and taxable tangible personal property where: Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2701.48(5). o the transaction includes food and food ingredients, drugs, durable medical equipment, mobility-enhancing equipment, over-the-counter drugs, prosthetic devices, or medical supplies; Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2701.48(5)(a). and o the seller's purchase price or sales price of the taxable tangible personal property is 50 percent or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled tangible personal property. Sellers may not use a combination of the purchase price and sales price of the tangible personal property when making the 50 percent determination for a transaction. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2701.48(5)(b). Bundled Telecommunications Services In the case of a bundled transaction of services that includes telecommunication services, if the price is attributable to services that are taxable and services that are nontaxable, the portion of the price attributable to the nontaxable service is subject to sales and use tax unless the provider can reasonably identify the nontaxable portion of the services from its books and records kept in the regular course of business. Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-108.06. BNA-SUTN NE 9.3.2.

Stat. §13-2813; Nebraska Information Guide No. 6-352-1994.

Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-27,142(1). Use of revenue generated from the county tax(as opposed to the municipal county tax) is limited to financing public services provided by a public safety commission or providing the county share of funds required under any other agreement executed under the Interlocal Cooperation Act or Joint Public Agency Act.
