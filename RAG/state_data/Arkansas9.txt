Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

True Object A transaction that otherwise meets the definition of a bundled transaction is not considered a bundled transaction where the true object exclusion applies. Ark. Regs. GR-93(D)(1). The true object exclusion only applies to transactions that involve a service and does not apply to transactions that include only tangible personal property. Ark. Regs. GR-93(D)(1). Where there is a retail sale of tangible personal property and a service, and the tangible personal property is essential to the use of the service and is provided exclusively in connection with the service, the true object of the transaction is the service. Ark. Regs. GR-93(D)(1)(a); cf. Arkansas Revenue Legal Counsel Opinion No. 20170703 (May 7, 2018) (contract does not specify that the sale of tangible personal property is provided exclusively in connection with the service and therefore is not eligible for the true object exclusion). Where there is a retail sale of services where one service is provided that is essential to the use or receipt of a second service, and the first service is provided exclusively in connection with the second service, the true object of the transaction is the second service. Ark. Regs. GR-93(D)(1)(b). Factors that are considered to determine the true object of the transaction are:• the seller's line of business; • the purchaser's object of the transaction; • whether the tangible personal property or service that is essential to the second service is available for sale separately without the second service; and • how the tangible person property or service is essential to the second services. Ark. Regs. GR-93(D)(1)(c). BNA-SUTN AR 9.3.1.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Bundled Transactions

Taxable Sales tax must be collected on the sales price of a bundled transaction if any product included in the bundled transaction would be taxable if sold separately. Ark. Regs. GR-93(A). A “bundled transaction”is the retail sale of two or more products, not including real property and services to real property, if the products are distinct and identifiable products and sold for one nonitemized price. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-103(2)(A). A bundled transaction does not include the sale of any products in which the sales price varies, or is negotiable, based on the selection by the purchaser of the products included in the transaction. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-103(2)(B). Distinct and identifiable products do not include: packaging such as containers, boxes, sacks, bags, and bottles or other materials such as wrapping, labels, tags, and instruction guides that accompany the retail sale of the products and are incidental or immaterial to the retail sale. Examples of packaging that are incidental or immaterial include grocery sacks, shoeboxes, dry cleaning garment bags, and express delivery envelopes and boxes. Ark. Regs. GR-93(C)(1)(a). A product provided free of charge with the required purchase of another product is also not a distinct and identifiable product. A product is provided free of charge if the sales price of the product purchased does not vary depending on the inclusion of the product provided free of charge. Ark. Regs. GR-93(C)(1)(b). One Nonitemized Price When a retail sale of two or more distinct and identifiable products is not made for one non-itemized price, the retail sale is not a bundled transaction. Ark. Regs. GR-93(C)(2). A retail transaction is not sold for one non-itemized prize in the following situations:• if the sales price varies by negotiation or is negotiable based on the purchaser's selection of products being sold; Ark. Regs. GR-93(C)(2)(a). • if the purchaser has the option of selecting products or declining to purchase any of the products being sold and as a result the sales price varies or a different price is negotiated; Ark. Regs. GR-93(C)(2)(b). • the price is separately identified by a product on binding sales or other supporting sales documentation, which is made available to the customer in paper or electronic form such as an invoice, bill or sale, receipt, or other similar documents; Ark. Regs. GR-93(C)(2)(c). • if a seller bills or invoices one price for the sale of distinct and separate products, but the price invoiced is equal to the total of the individually priced or itemized products contained in the supporting sales documentation; Ark. Regs. GR-93(C)(2)(d). • if the seller bills or invoices one price for a transaction that includes a bundle of products and includes one or more additional products that are individually priced or itemized, the additional products are not considered to be a part of the bundled products; Ark. Regs. GR-93(C)(2)(e). and • if a transaction is not a bundled transaction for the reasons listed above, the transaction will not be classified as a bundled transaction as a result of the seller offering a subsequent discount on the total sales price without itemizing the discount for each product. Ark. Regs. GR-93(C)(2)(f). Transactions Not Considered Bundled Transactions A transaction that otherwise meets the definition of a bundled transaction is not a bundled transaction if the transaction is described by any one of the following statements:• A transaction that includes taxable products and nontaxable products and the purchase price or sales price of the taxable products is de minimis. Ark. Regs. GR-93(D)(2). o De minimis means the seller's purchase price or sales price of the taxable products is 10 percent or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled products. Ark. Regs. GR-93(D)(2)(a). o Sellers must use either the purchase price or the sales price of the products to determine if the taxable products are de minimis. Sellers may not use a combination of the purchase price and sales price of the products to determine if the taxable products are de minimis. Ark. Regs. GR-93(D)(2)(b). o Sellers must use the full term of a service contract to determine if the taxable products are de minimis. Ark. Regs. GR-93(D)(2)(c); Arkansas Revenue Legal Counsel Opinion No. 20170703 (May 7, 2018). o Sellers of bundled transactions that include tangible personal property and a service or multiple services may use the true object exclusion or the de minimis exclusion. Ark. Regs. GR-93(D)(2)(d). • The retail sale of exempt tangible personal property and taxable tangible personal property where: o The transaction includes food and food ingredients, drugs, durable medical equipment, mobility-enhancing equipment, over-the-counter drugs, prosthetic devices, or medical supplies; Ark. Regs. GR-93(D)(3)(a). and o If the seller's purchase price or sales price of the taxable tangible personal property is 50 percent or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled tangible personal property. Sellers may not use a combination of the purchase price and sales price of the tangible personal property when making the 50 percent determination for a transaction. Ark. Regs. GR-93(D)(3)(b). Bundled Telecommunications Services A bundled transaction that contains both taxable and non-taxable items, is considered a retail sale and the entire price is subject to tax unless one element of the bundle is a telecommunications service. In the case of a bundled transaction that includes telecommunication services, and the seller has maintained books and records identifying the portions of the price that are attributable to the distinct and separately identifiable exempt products, then the products are not considered part of a bundled transaction and may be excluded from the sales price subject to tax. Ark. Regs. GR-93(F). For the purposes of a bundled transaction including telecommunications services:• books and records maintained by the seller must be maintained in the regular course of business and do not include books and records created and maintained by the seller primarily for tax purposes; • books and records maintained in the regular course of business include but are not limited to financial statements, general ledgers, invoicing and billing systems and reports, and reports for regulatory tariffs and other regulatory matters; and • books and records are maintained primarily for tax purposes when the books and records identify taxable and nontaxable portions of the price, but the seller maintains other books and records that identify different prices attributable to the distinct products included in the same bundled transaction. Ark. Regs. GR-93(F). BNA-SUTN AR 9.3.2.

Code Ann. §26-73-112(b). Border Cities The Arkansas legislature recognized that differing local tax rates (between cities in neighboring states) created an inequitable tax system that adversely affected border cities therefore, the Arkansas Legislature enacted laws designed to establish a method of equalizing the inequities. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-601. A border city is an Arkansas city or incorporated town that is divided by a state line from an incorporated city or town in an adjoining state. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-303(a)(1).
