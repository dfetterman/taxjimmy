Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Tangible Personal Property

Destination Except as specifically provided otherwise, the New York sales tax is a “destination tax.” N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, § 525.2(a)(3). The point of delivery or the location at which possession of property is transferred to the purchaser by the seller, or the purchaser's designee, or where services are received by the purchaser, determines if sales tax is due, and if due, the seller is required to collect New York and local sales taxes at the combined rate applicable in the taxing jurisdiction where delivery occurs. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, § 525.2(a)(3); New York TSB-A-07(16)S (June 22, 2007) (the department reiterated “the point at which possession of tangible personal property is transferred by the vendor to the purchaser, or the purchaser's designee, controls both the tax incidence and the tax rate,” and as a result, “only the charges attributable to customers located in New York state are subject to sales tax”). If delivery is made by common carrier, sales tax is due based on where the common carrier delivers the property, regardless of who hired the common carrier, even if title to these goods passes within New York. However, when a purchaser buys tangible personal property from a store and directs the seller to deliver the property by common carrier to a third party as a gift, the sale is deemed to occur at the location of the store where the purchase was made. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, § 526.7(e); N.Y. Tax Law §1101(b)(5); N.Y. Tax Law §1213; New York TB-ST-155; In re Hotel Depot, Inc., New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 827556 (Jan. 3, 2019) (reasonable for the division to source deliveries to the “ship-to”address listed on invoices); TSB-A-98(13)S (Feb. 25, 1998) (furniture manufactured in New York and delivered to Las Vegas); New York TSB-A-97(50)S (Aug. 14, 1997) (flat rate charged for business conferences held on ocean liners that sail into international waters from New York harbor not taxed, because taxable events occured outside New York and its territorial waters); New York TSB-A-90(43)S (Aug. 20, 1990) (marketing research reports only taxable when delivered within the state); New York TSB-A-89(42)S (Nov. 14, 1989) (Florida sales representatives of New York corporation transmitted orders for delivery of audio-video equipment to Florida customers). A common carrier is a carrier that:• holds itself out to the public as one who will agree to transport tangible personal property for all who apply; • is required to carry for all who apply; • agrees to carry for a specified and standard rate of compensation; and • makes deliveries under standard delivery schedules. New York TB-ST-155. The following examples illustrate exceptions to the destination sourcing rule: Regarding gift shipments, purchases of merchandise in out-of-state stores by nonresidents of New York as gifts for New York residents are not subject to New York sales tax. The event is viewed as two transactions: an out-of-state sale, followed by a gift to a New York donee. Bloomingdale Bros. v. Chu, 70 N.Y.2d 218, 513 N.E.2d 333, (N.Y. 1987). Sales of software that is electronically accessed are sourced to New York when used in New York. New York TSB-A-17(15)S (Aug. 1, 2017). BNA-SUTN NY 4.1.1.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Services

Destination Services are sourced to where a taxpayer uses the services. New York TB-ST-913. Credit Rating Service Sourcing The New York Department of Taxation and Finance advised that the best method of determining local sales tax for credit rating services is by using the address to which the invoice for the service is sent. Therefore, a credit rating service that is invoiced to an address within New York City will be subject to the city's 4.5 percent local sales tax. No sales tax is due to either the state or New York City if the credit rating service is invoiced to an address outside of New York City. This rule applies to all taxable sales of credit rating services originally invoiced to an address within New York City on or after Sept. 1, 2015. New York TSB-M-15(4)S (July 24, 2015). Telecommunications Mobile telecommunications services are sourced to the taxing jurisdiction in which the mobile telecommunications customer's place of primary use is located, such as the customer's residential or business street address. New York TSB-A-10(24)S (May 4, 2010). When sales of prepaid mobile calling services take place at a brick and mortar store, the sales are taxable at the State and local rate in effect at that location. If the sale does not take place there, the sale will be determined to take place at the purchaser's shipping address or, if there is no item shipped, at the purchaser's billing address or the location associated with the purchaser's mobile telephone number, or, if the vendor does not have the address or the location associated with the customer's mobile telephone number, at such address, as approved by the commissioner, that reasonably reflects the customer's location at the time of the sale or recharge. N.Y. Tax Law §1101(b)(22)(A); New York TSB-A-17(18)S (Aug. 3, 2017). BNA-SUTN NY 4.1.2.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Leases and Rentals

Destination To determine if property should be sourced to New York, the transfer of possession with respect to a rental, lease, or license to use requires that one or more of three attributes of property ownership has been transferred. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §526.7(e)(4). These three attributes are:• custody or possession of the tangible personal property, actual or constructive; N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §526.7(e)(4)(i). • the right to custody or possession of the tangible personal property; N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §526.7(e)(4)(ii). and • the right to use, or control, or direct the use of the tangible personal property. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §526.7(e)(4)(iii). BNA-SUTN NY 4.1.3.

Destination The local tax will apply where tangible personal property is used. Even though New York state and local sales tax may have been collected where a customer purchased an item, if the local tax was collected at a rate that is lower than the rate at the location where the customer lives and uses the item, the taxpayer will owe the difference in use tax. New York TB-ST-913. BNA-SUTN NY 4.1.4.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Credit for Tax Paid to Another Jurisdiction

Depends Whether New York allows a credit for tax paid to another jurisdiction depends on whether the state to which the tax was paid grants credit for sales tax paid in New York. N.Y. Tax Law §1118(7); see also New York Publication 39; New York TB-ST-913; New York TSB-M-14(11)S (July 22, 2014). New York allows a reciprocal use tax credit up to the amount of any sales or use tax paid to another state. This credit applies only if the state to which the tax was paid grants credit for sales tax paid in New York. N.Y. Tax Law §1118(7); see also New York Publication 39 (providing a state-by-state guide that explains how New York addresses reciprocal credits for sales tax paid to other states); New York TB-ST-913 (explaining how New York addresses credit for sales tax paid on purchases made outside of New York); New York TSB-M-14(11)S (July 22, 2014) (explaining that beginning Dec. 18, 2013, New York exempts motor vehicles purchased out-of-state by persons serving in the U.S. military if the person paid tax to the other state to obtain title). If the amount is less than what would be paid under New York sales tax law, then the owner must remit the difference to the state. In addition to state taxes paid, New York allows a taxpayer to take a credit against New York state taxes due for taxes paid to a local jurisdiction or the District of Columbia. N.Y. Tax Law §1118(7); see also New York Publication 39 (providing a state-by-state guide that explains how New York addresses reciprocal credits for sales tax paid to other states); New York TB-ST-913 (explaining how New York addresses credit for sales tax paid on purchases made outside of New York); New York TSB-M-14(11)S (July 22, 2014) (explaining that beginning Dec. 18, 2013, New York exempts motor vehicles purchased out-of-state by persons serving in the U.S. military if the person paid tax to the other state to obtain title).

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Temporary Presence, In-Transit Property Tangible Personal Property First Used Out-of-state

Nontaxable A New York resident taxpayer does not owe use tax on taxable property or services purchased before she became a New York resident. N.Y. Tax Law §1118(2); New York TB-ST-913. But see New York TSB-M-09(4)S (May 12, 2009) (addressing nonresident purchases of aircraft, vessels, and motor vehicles). The definition of resident for sales and use tax purposes is broader than the definition of resident provided in the personal income tax. The income tax defines a statutory resident as one having a permanent place of abode in New York for substantially all of the year who spends 183 days (or parts of days)within New York. For sales and use tax purposes, the only requirement is having a permanent place of abode within New York. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §526.15(a)(1). A nonresident who engages in business in New York is not considered a nonresident with respect to any taxable property or services used in such business. N.Y. Tax Law §1118(2); New York TSB-M-09(4)S (May 12, 2009) (discussing nonresident exemption). Effective April 10, 2017, use tax is now imposed when a nonresident business brings tangible personal property or a taxable service into New York for use there unless the nonresident business has been doing business outside of New York for at least six months prior to the date that the property or service is brought into New York State. N.Y. Tax Law §1118(2), as amended by 2017 N.Y. A.B. 3009, Part CC effective April 10, 2017; New York TSB-M-17(4)S (Aug. 14, 2017). Doing business means that the business is actively engaged in normal operating activities, such as hiring employees, having a payroll, and making routine purchases and sales. Merely being organized as a legal entity is not a sufficient indication of doing business absent other normal operating activities. New York TSB-M-17(4)S (Aug. 14, 2017). Prior to April 10, 2017, a corporation that had never previously conducted business in New York did not owe use tax on property it brings into the state when it first begins doing business in New York. N.Y. Tax Law §1118(2). BNA-SUTN NY 4.3.1.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Temporary Presence, In-Transit Property Tangible Personal Property Purchased for Use Out-of-state

Depends Sales and use tax is generally imposed on purchases made or delivered in New York. New York TB-ST-913. However, a motor vehicle that is purchased in New York is not subject to sales and use tax if it is purchased by a customer, who at the time of delivery, is a nonresident, has no permanent place of abode in New York, and is not engaged in carrying on in New York any employment, trade, business or profession in which the motor vehicle will be used in New York, if:• the vendor of such motor vehicle issues a temporary certificate of registration; • the purchaser does not register the motor vehicle in New York before registering the motor vehicle in another jurisdiction; and • prior to taking delivery, the purchaser furnishes to such vendor a statement that the motor vehicle will not be used in New York, as required by the commissioner. N.Y. Tax Law §1117(a). BNA-SUTN NY 4.3.3.
