Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Leases and Rentals

Destination In Wyoming, the lease or rental of tangible personal property is generally sourced in the same manner as a retail sale. However, special sourcing rules apply when the lease or rental requires recurring periodic payments. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-104(f)(ii); Wyo. Stat. §39-16-104(e)(ii). For a lease or rental of tangible personal property, other than transportation equipment, the transaction is sourced as follows: Wyo. Stat. §39-15-104(f)(ii); Wyo. Stat. §39-16-104(e)(ii). • A lease or rental that requires recurring periodic payments, the first periodic payment is sourced as a retail sale in line with the general sourcing principals, that is, where the customer receives the leased property. Subsequent periodic payments are sourced to the primary property location covered by that payment. The primary property location is indicated by an address the lessee provides that the lessor can access from its records maintained in the ordinary course of business. The use of this address cannot constitute bad faith. The location of the property must not be altered by intermittent use at different locations. The location of the property is not altered by intermittent use at different locations, for example, use of property that accompanies employees on business trips and service calls. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-104(f)(ii)(A); Wyo. Stat. §39-16-104(e)(ii)(A). • A lease or rental that does not require recurring periodic payments is sourced the same as a retail sales in line with the general sourcing principles set forth in the statute. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-104(f)(ii)(B); Wyo. Stat. §39-16-104(e)(ii)(B). • The computation or imposition of sales or use tax on leases or rentals based on a lump sum or accelerated basis, or on the acquisition or property for lease is not affected by this section.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Local Sourcing

Destination The sales and use taxes apply to all retail transactions consummated within a city or county imposing a retail sales tax. The sourcing rules of the state of Wyoming apply for sourcing at the local level. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-104(f)(i); Wyo. Stat. §39-15-203(a)(i)(E)(II); Wyo. Stat. §39-15-205; Wyo.

For the purposes of sourcing sales in Wyoming, the determining factor is the point of possession or receipt. Thus, taxable sales within Wyoming are sourced to the county where the customer takes possession. Taxable services are sourced where the customer is able to make first use of the service. Wyoming Sales and Use Tax Bulletin—Sourcing:Where and When Tax is Due. A retail sale, not including leases or rentals, will be sourced to the location of the seller if the product is received by the purchaser at the seller's place of business. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-104(f)(i)(A); Wyo. Stat. §39-16-104(e)(i)(A); Wyo. Regs. ch. 2 §5(a)(i). When the product is not received at the seller's business location, then the sale is sourced to the location where the purchaser or purchaser's donee received the item. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-104(f)(i)(B); Wyo. Stat. §39-16-104(e)(i)(B). If neither situation applies, then the sale is sourced to the address of the purchaser that is available from the business records of the seller when such records are maintained in the ordinary course of business and when use of the address does not constitute bad faith. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-104(f)(i)(C); Wyo. Stat. §39-16-104(e)(i)(C). If none of these rules apply, then the place where the items were shipped from will be the location of the sale. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-104(f)(i)(E); Wyo. Stat. §39-16-104(e)(i)(E). . The lease or rental of property that has recurring payments will be sourced to two locations. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-104(f)(ii); Wyo. Stat. §39-16-104(e)(ii). The first payment will be sourced in the same manner as a retail sale payment. The subsequent payments are sourced to the primary location of the property for each period covered by the payment. The primary location is determined by the address for the property provided by the lessee in the lessor's records that are maintained in the ordinary course of business and when use of the address does not constitute bad faith. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-104(f)(ii); Wyo. Stat. §39-16-104(e)(ii). For leases or rentals not involving periodic payments, the payment is sourced under the rules for retail sales. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-104(f)(ii)(B); Wyo. Stat. §39-16-104(e)(ii)(B). BNA-SUTN WY 4.1.4.

Yes Wyoming allows a reciprocal use tax credit up to the amount of any sales tax paid to another state. Wyo. Stat. §39-16-109(d)(iii). A use tax credit applies to items where sales tax has been imposed by and paid to another state, up to but not exceeding any Wyoming use tax liability due to a difference in tax rates. Wyo.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Temporary Presence, In-Transit Property Tangible Personal Property First Used Out-of-state

Nontaxable The use tax does not apply to tangible personal property when it is purchased and used in another state and used for the purpose for which it was manufactured or assembled before its use in Wyoming. Wyo. Stat. §39-16-103(a)(i); Wyo. Stat. §39-16-103(c)(iv); Wyo. Regs. ch. 2 §3(h)(i). The Board of Equalization has applied this rule to a case involving an airplane that had been purchased in South Carolina and used to travel from South Carolina to Texas and from Texas to Montana before being stored in Wyoming. The board held that since the airplane was use for the purpose for which it was manufacturer or assembled (travel) and that the use had occurred prior to the airplane being transported into Wyoming that no sales tax was due. In re Admiral Beverage Corp., Wyoming Administrative Decision 2014-107 (Oct. 19, 2016); see also Wyo. Stat. §39-16-101(a)(ix); Wyo. Stat. §39-16-103(a)(i); Wyo. Stat. §39-16-103(c)(iv).

Nontaxable The use tax only applies to tangible personal property that is first used in-state, which creates a taxable event. Barcon, Inc. v. Wyoming State Bd. of Equal., 845 P.2d 373 (Wyo. 1992). If tangible personal property is purchased in Wyoming and directly transferred out-of-state, the purchaser uses it for the first time out-of-state, and the use tax does not apply. Barcon, Inc. v. Wyoming State Bd. of Equal., 845 P.2d 373 (Wyo. 1992). BNA-SUTN WY 4.3.3.
