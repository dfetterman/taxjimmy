Kansas Department of Revenue The local sales tax is administered by the Kansas Department of Revenue. The administration, enforcement, and collection of the local sales taxes are required to be the same as the administration and collection of the Kansas retailers' sales tax. Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-189, as amended by 2019 Kan. H.B. 2140, effective July 1, 2019; Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-21-6.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Vendor/Seller Registration

Required A retailer that is responsible for collecting and remitting sales or use tax must file an application for a sales tax permit or registration certificate with the Commissioner of the Kansas Department of Revenue. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3608; Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-2a; Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-20-9; Kansas Information Guide KS-1216. Only a business that is actively engaged in making retail sales or performing taxable services that are subject to Kansas sales tax may hold a registration certificate. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-2a(c); Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-20-9; Kansas Information Guide KS-1216. A separate registration certificate must be issued for each place of business and must be conspicuously displayed at the establishment. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3608(b); Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-2a(a)(4); Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-20-9; Kansas Information Guide KS-1216. A certificate shall be valid only for use by the individual, partnership, corporation, or association in whose name it is issued and for the transaction of business at the place designated on the certificate. Registration certificates may not be assigned or transferred. If there is a change in ownership or a change in the name or location of a business, the old certificate must be returned to the Department of Revenue, and the proprietors must apply for a new certificate. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-2a(a)(6); Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-20-9. Retailers that are responsible for filing an application for a registration certificate include retailers that are located in or maintain a place of business in Kansas, and out-of-state retailers that engage in business in Kansas in any of the following methods: Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-20-7(a). • maintaining directly, indirectly, or through a subsidiary, an office, distribution house, sales house, warehouse, or other place of business; • having an agent, salesperson, or solicitor operating within the state under the authority of the retailer or its subsidiary, regardless of whether the agent, salesperson or solicitor is located in this state permanently or temporarily, or whether the retailer or subsidiary is qualified to do business within this state; or • soliciting orders within the state through catalogues or other advertising media. Agents of the Vendor In certain situations, in-state and out-of-state retail vendors may operate within Kansas through salespersons or other representatives. When this occurs, the Commissioner of the Kansas Department of Revenue is authorized to treat representatives of vendors as agents of the vendor, and as such, require them to register for a compensating/use tax registration identification card bearing the account identification number issued to the retailer on the retailer's compensating/use tax registration certificate. This can include truckers, peddlers, or canvassers as agents of a dealer or distributor. Salespersons, representatives, truckers, peddlers, etc. must carry this identification card and show it to purchasers as proof of authority to collect the compensating/use tax. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-20-7(c). Revocation of Vendor License The sales tax permit is valid until cancelled or revoked. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-20-7(c); Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-2a. The Commissioner may cancel a sales tax registration certificate of any taxpayer found in default with regard to sales or use taxes due or in the filing of any return for a period of at least 60 days. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3608(c). Also, a registration certificate may be cancelled by the director if during any prior consecutive 12-month period the certificate holder does not file a return or, if any returns are filed, does not report any taxable transactions. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-2a(c). Vendors may not continue to engage in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail or furnish taxable services after the registration certificate has been suspended or revoked. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3608(e). A suspended or revoked registration certificate shall not be reinstated until all outstanding tax, penalty, and interest liabilities are satisfied. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3608(d). Markets, Trade Shows, Etc. During flea markets, craft or trade shows, conventions, or exhibitions, the Kansas Department of Revenue imposes obligations on both the general operator of the event and on the individual businesses that seek to do business at such an event. Kansas requires all persons and entities that make retail sales within Kansas to collect and remit sales tax, even if the vendor only sells one time per year, including non-profit charitable organizations. Event coordinators are required to provide the Department of Revenue with notification of an event and a list of all participating vendors. All vendors, sellers, exhibitors, or booth owners must either register for a Kansas sales tax registration certificate or agree to remit the tax collected immediately after the special event using the tax packet made specifically for the event. Vendors who choose not to use the special event packet, and who apply for a Kansas sales tax registration certificate must file returns in accordance with the general provisions governing the filing of returns, discussed above.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Tax Collection and Remittance

Vendor Kansas requires retail vendors to collect tax from all applicable purchases and to remit the tax to the Department of Revenue. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3604. If the vendor provides the purchaser with a receipt that does not state the sales or use tax separately, and also does not state that the tax is included in the price, then it will be presumed that the tax was not charged or collected from the purchaser. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-61a(d). See Kansas Information Guide KS-1510. If the seller willfully fails to collect the appropriate sales tax due, then the seller is personally liable to pay the tax. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3643(a); Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-61a(a). Each retail sale shall be presumed to be taxable, and the burden of proof is imposed on the vendor to show that the tax was collected from the customer and remitted to the state or that an exemption certificate was secured from the customer that covers the transaction. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-61a(c). A seller will not be held personally liable if the seller takes from the purchaser a valid exemption certificate stating that the transaction is not subject to tax. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3651(a). Liability for Use Tax An individual or business that uses, stores, distributes or consumes tangible personal property in Kansas is liable for the use tax. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3703. Kansas has mandated that any evidence that tangible personal property was sold by any person for delivery in Kansas establishes a rebuttable presumption that the property was sold for use in Kansas, which would give rise to liability for use tax if applicable sales tax has not been paid on the item. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3703a. Use tax will not be due on the storage or consumption of tangible personal property brought by a non-resident into Kansas for no more than 60 days, or where the underlying sale of the same asset would not be subject to sales tax in Kansas. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3704. Otherwise, goods brought into Kansas for the purpose of storage, use, or consumption will be subject to use tax. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3703. Additionally, if an item of tangible personal property has already been subject to use tax in another state in the hands of its current owner, then the use tax due is reduced by the amount of use tax previously paid to another state. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3705. Successor Liability Often, when a business is sold in its entirety, the issue arises whether the business accrued unpaid sales and use taxes while under the management of the previous business owners. In Kansas, if the business that is being sold owes delinquent sales or use taxes, the state Department of Revenue automatically will have an enforceable lien for unpaid sales taxes against the business. The new business owner or ‘successor’ to the business assets could be liable for these unpaid sales and use taxes unless the successor complies with certain requirements. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3612; Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3703. The person acquiring the business must withhold a portion of the purchase price in an amount that is sufficient to cover any outstanding taxes due and unpaid by the seller, rather than paying the full purchase price directly to the seller. The purchaser must withhold this amount until the seller of the business furnishes the purchaser with a receipt from the director of the Department of Revenue showing that the outstanding taxes have been paid. At this point the purchaser is personally liable for the payment of the outstanding sales tax liability up to the value of the business being purchased. If the seller does not furnish the purchaser a receipt from the director of the Department of Revenue within 20 days from the date of the sale of the business, then the purchaser must remit the withheld funds to the Department of Revenue. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3612; Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3703. BNA-SUTN KS 31.3.1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Business Owners, Operators

Yes Kansas imposes personal liability for unpaid sales taxes on certain corporate officers, supervisors, and any other individuals or entities that are in a position of authority or control who are responsible for collecting and remitting sales taxes and who willfully fail to do so. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3643(a). In Kansas, a responsible individual is any person with sufficient status, duties, and authority to have significant control of business finances or the disbursement of funds. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-64a(b). This liability will apply regardless of the technical relationship between the retailer and the individual, the form under which the retailer conducts business operations, or whether the business ceases to exist. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3643(a). If a responsible person has one or more of the following examples of status, duties, or authority, the Department of Revenue will presume that the individual has significant control over business finances or the disbursement of business funds, and will be presumed liable for unpaid sales taxes: Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-64a(c). • owning a significant interest in the business; • having significant involvement in the day-to-day management of the business; • having authority to sign business checks or tax returns; • having authority to direct payment of business funds to creditors; • having authority to pledge business assets as collateral for loans, advances, or lines of credit for the business; • having authority to bind the business to contracts entered into as part of day-to-day business operations; or • having authority to hire or fire employees who are authorized to perform any of the acts described above. One or more of the following acts or omissions will show that a responsible individual acted willfully in failing to collect, account for, or remit taxes: Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-64a(e). • making a deliberate choice that the business should pay other creditors in spite of having knowledge that taxes collected are not being remitted to the state of Kansas; • having knowledge of the tax delinquency and failing to exercise authority to rectify it if funds were available to pay the state of Kansas; • performing a voluntary or intentional act or failing to perform such an act with knowledge that the act or omission will result in the failure of the business to collect, account for, or remit taxes owed to the state of Kansas; • failing to investigate or to correct mismanagement after notice that taxes owed to the state of Kansas are not being remitted; or • embezzling business funds. BNA-SUTN KS 31.3.3.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Certificates Required

Yes Retail vendors that are required to have a state sales tax license covering retail sales made to final consumers are required to have a State Sales and Use Tax Certificate of Exemption to cover the purchaser's sales for resale. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3651(d); Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement - Certificate of Exemption.; Kansas Information Guide KS-1520; Kansas Information Guide KS-1525. Individuals or businesses that are not required to have a state sales tax license, which nevertheless are entitled to make certain sales tax-free purchases at wholesale, must obtain a State Sales and Use Tax Certificate of Exemption. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3651(b), (c); Kan Stat. Ann. §79-3609(a); Kansas Information Guide KS-1520; Kansas Information Guide KS-1525; Kansas Information Guide KS-1216. Generally, all sales at retail are presumed to be taxable. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3651(a); Kansas Information Guide KS-1520; Kansas Information Guide KS-1525. However, with respect to sales for which the true object of the transaction is for a service that is not enumerated as taxable, the purchaser of the services is not required to present an exemption certificate when making payment because the transaction is not subject to tax and thereby does not need to be exempted. Opinion Letter O-2010-011. Retention Periods Vendors are expected to retain records of the exemption certificates for at least three years. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-25b(g); Kansas Information Guide KS-1520; Kansas Information Guide KS-1525. The state does not specify the duration of time that a seller should retain exemption certificates, but the statute of limitations on assessing sales tax in Kansas is three years after the date the return is filed. Therefore, a taxpayer should maintain such records for a minimum of three years from such filings. Kansas Information Guide KS-1520; Kan Stat. Ann. §79-3609(b). Consequences of Failing to Obtain Exemption Certificates The seller is responsible for obtaining an exemption certificate or else the sale is presumed taxable. If the seller obtains an exemption certificate or other sufficient information, the seller is relieved of any liability for the tax on the transaction. If the seller cannot produce an exemption certificate or other sufficient information substantiating the claimed exemption, the seller will be liable for tax. Kansas Information Guide KS-1520. Exemption Certificate Substitutions, Data Elements To substitute for an exemption certificate, any alternative must:• explain why the sale is exempt; • be dated; • describe the property being purchased (unless using Form PR-78SSTA); and • contain the seller's name and address and the buyer's name, address, and signature. Kansas Information Guide KS-1520. Blanket Certificates An exempt purchaser who holds an exemption certificates and who has a recurring business relationship with the vendor, meaning no lapse of relationship over a 12-month period, may obtain a blanket exemption certificate. A blanket certificate specifies that all tangible personal property subsequently purchased will be exempt. This relieves the purchaser of providing a separate exemption certificate for each qualifying tax exempt purchase, as long as there is a recurring business relationship. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3651(c);Kansas Information Guide KS-1520; Kansas Information Guide KS-1525. BNA-SUTN KS 31.8.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Validity Periods

Until Revoked All exemption certificates for exempt entities are given expiration dates, and any other exemption certificate is valid as long as the exempt purpose it represents still exists. Kan Stat. Ann. §79-3609; Kansas Information Guide KS-1520. It is the responsibility of the user to keep exemption certificates current, and a seller is responsible for not accepting expired exemption certificates. However, a certificate need not be renewed or updated when there is a recurring business relationship between the buyer and seller. A recurring business relationship exists when a period of no more than 12 months elapses between sales transactions. Kansas Information Guide KS-1520; Kan Stat. Ann. §79-3609. Blanket Certificates When using blanket exemption certificates for a regularly exempt customer, ask the customer to verify or renew the document every year.

In certain circumstances where the nature of a taxpayer's business makes it difficult at the time of purchase to determine the applicability of sales or use tax upon purchases of tangible personal property, the Department of Revenue may issue permits that allow the purchaser to make purchases without paying sales tax to the vendor. Instead, the purchaser is required to remit the applicable sales tax directly to the Department of Revenue. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3619(b); Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-82(c)(2)(B). A direct pay permit holder may utilize the permit by providing a copy of the permit to each vendor when a purchase is made. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-82(g). The direct pay permit may not be used in connection with the following: • taxable meals or beverages; • taxable lodging or related services; • admission to places of amusement; • memberships, dues, and other similar fees; • taxable fees to participate in sports and other recreational activities; • motor vehicles, aircraft, boats, and other tangible personal property required to be licensed or titled with any taxing authority; • telephone, mobile phone services, and other similar services; • real property construction services pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3603;and • other purchases prescribed by the secretary or agreed to by the permit holder. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-82(b).
