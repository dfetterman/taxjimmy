Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Services

Depends Sales of taxable services such as laundry, cleaning, pressing, and dyeing services, are sourced to the location where the laundered, cleaned, pressed, or dyed article is returned to the customer. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(14)(e). Telecommunications Services Generally Telecommunications services sold on a basis other than call-by-call are subject to tax in Louisiana if the telecommunications service is charged to a customer whose place of primary use is located in the state. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301.1(A)(2). Telecommunications Services Sold on a Call-by-Call Basis Louisiana sources telecommunications services sold on a call-by-call basis to Louisiana if the call:• originates and terminates in Louisiana; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301.1(A)(1)(a). or • originates or terminates in Louisiana, and the service address associated with the call is located in Louisiana. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301.1(A)(1)(b). Mobile Telecommunications Services Mobile telecommunications services provided by a customer's home service provider are sourced to Louisiana if the customer's place of primary use is located in the state. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301.1(A)(3). Prepaid Calling Services and Prepaid Wireless Calling Services For purposes of state sales and use tax, sales of prepaid calling service or prepaid wireless calling service are treated as sales of tangible personal property. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(16)(d)(i). As such, prepaid calling services and prepaid wireless calling services are subject to tax in Louisiana if sold within the state. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(16)(d)(ii). If a customer physically purchases a prepaid calling service or prepaid wireless calling service at a vendor's place of business, the sale is deemed to take place at the vendor's place of business. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(16)(d)(ii). If the customer does not physically purchase the service at the vendor's place of business, the sale of a prepaid calling service or prepaid wireless calling service is deemed to occur:• at the customer's shipping address, if the sale involves a shipment; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(16)(d)(ii)(aa). • at the customer's billing address, if the sale does not involve a shipment; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(16)(d)(ii)(bb). • at any other address of the customer known by the vendor, if the sale does not involve a shipment to the customer and the customer does not have a billing address at which the sale may be deemed to occur; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(16)(d)(ii)(cc). or • if the situs of the sale cannot be determined under any of the above rules, at the address of the vendor, or in the case of prepaid wireless calling service, at the location associated with the mobile telephone number to which the prepaid wireless calling service applies. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(16)(d)(ii)(dd). Use tax is not levied on the use of prepaid calling services or prepaid wireless calling services on which Louisiana sales tax was previously imposed. See La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:302(A)(2); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:331(A)(2) (stating that no duplication of tax is allowed); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:321(A)(2) (exempting all prepaid calling services and prepaid wireless calling services from the 1-percent use tax imposed by that section). Air-to-ground Radio Telephone Services Air-to-ground radio telephone services are sourced to Louisiana if the customer's place of primary use is located in the state. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301.1(A)(4)(a). Postpaid Calling Services Postpaid calling services are sourced to Louisiana if the origination point of the telecommunications signal is located in the state, as first identified by either the seller's telecommunications system; or information received by the seller from its service provider, where the system used to transport the telecommunications signal is not that of the seller. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301.1(A)(4)(b). Private Communication Services For private communication services, Louisiana sales and use tax applies to:• separate charges for specific channel termination points located in Louisiana; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301.1(A)(4)(c)(i). • separate charges for the use of channels that are located exclusively between two channel termination points located in Louisiana; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301.1(A)(4)(c)(ii). and • if channel termination points of a channel are located both within and outside Louisiana: ○ 50 percent of any separate charges for segments of channels located between two channel termination points; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301.1(A)(4)(c)(iii)(aa). and ○ to the extent that charges for any segment or segments of a channel located between two channel termination points is not separately billed, an amount equal to the total charge for such channel segment or segments multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of channel termination points located in the state and the denominator of which is the total number of channel termination points. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301.1(A)(4)(c)(iii)(bb). BNA-SUTN LA 4.1.2.

In-State Use/Possession Louisiana provides that the lease or rental of tangible personal property is subject to tax when a lessee possesses or uses the leased property within Louisiana, regardless of where the lessor and lessee entered into the lease contract or where possession of the leased property is transferred.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Local Sourcing

Destination For purposes of local sales tax, the sale of tangible personal property is sourced to the point of delivery or to the location at which possession of property is transferred to the purchaser by the seller. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(12); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:303(A); La. Admin. Code tit. 61, §4307(A); see Tunica-Biloxi Tribe v. Louisiana, 964 F.2d 1536 (5th Cir. 1992) (discussing the “taxable moment”). Louisiana applies a destination-based sourcing rule for state and local use tax purposes. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:303(A); La. Admin. Code tit. 61, §4307(A). Simplified Consumer Use Tax Administration However, Louisiana does provide for somewhat simplified reporting of consumer use tax by applying an 8.45-percent tax rate to all remote purchases on which use tax is owed by the purchaser, in lieu of the combined state and local sales tax rate imposed in the purchaser's location. Under this program, purchasers are not obligated to determine the correct local jurisdiction to which their purchases should be sourced or calculate tax using multiple local rates. Of the 8.45-percent consumer use tax, 4.45 percent is allocated to the state and the other 4 percent is distributed amongst local taxing jurisdictions by the Department of Revenue. This simplified consumer use tax program went into effect on April 1, 2016. Prior to July 1, 2018, the simplified rate was 9 percent, with 5 percent allocated to the state and 4 percent distributed amongst the local jurisdictions. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:302(K); Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin 18-019 (June 29, 2018); Louisiana Dept. of Rev., Frequently Asked Questions: Consumer Use Tax (last visited July 25, 2019) (noting that the state tax rate was decreased to 4.45 percent from 5 percent by 2018 La. H.B. 10). BNA-SUTN LA 4.1.4.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Credit for Tax Paid to Another Jurisdiction

Yes Louisiana allows a reciprocal use tax credit up to the amount of any sales or use tax paid to another state or the District of Columbia. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 47:303(A)(3); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 47:337.86(A)(1); Louisiana Publication R-1002 (January 2019); see also Louisiana Publication R-1002A (January 2017) (referring to this as a “credit[,] not an exemption/exclusion”). Credit against state use tax is not allowed for sales or use tax paid to local taxing authorities of another state. However, a credit for sales or use tax paid to a local taxing authority of another state may be claimed against the use tax imposed by any local taxing authority of Louisiana. This credit is also only allowed for taxes paid to jurisdictions that provide a similar credit for taxes paid to Louisiana. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 47:303(A)(3); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 47:337.86(A)(1); Louisiana Publication R-1002 (January 2019); see also Louisiana Publication R-1002A (January 2017) (referring to this as a “credit[,] not an exemption/exclusion”). Credit for taxes paid to another jurisdiction is based on when the taxes were actually paid, rather than when the taxes were initially due. Thus, a taxpayer may receive credit for taxes paid to another authority prior to owing taxes to Louisiana or a local taxing authority in Louisiana on the same property. However, taxes that were due to another authority, but not paid prior to owing tax in Louisiana will not be credited against the amount owed in Louisiana. Turner Bros. Crane & Rigging, LLC v. Ascension Par. Sales & Use Tax Auth., No. 2016 CA 0673, 2017 BL 231139 (La. Ct. App. July 5, 2017), cert. denied 229 So. 3d 470 (La. 2017). BNA-SUTN LA 4.2.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Temporary Presence, In-Transit Property Tangible Personal Property First Used Out-of-state

Depends With the exception of motor vehicles purchased by certain military personnel, Louisiana does not generally provide a sales or use tax exemption for property first used outside the state and later brought in the state for use or consumption in the state. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 47:305(E). Louisiana law explains the state's intention to impose tax on the use or consumption in the state of tangible personal property “after it has come to rest in this state and has become a part of the mass of property in this state.” La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 47:305(E); see Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin No. 16-034 (July 14, 2016). Property that is imported into a Louisiana taxing jurisdiction to be used, consumed, distributed, or stored to be used or consumed in a taxing jurisdiction is taxable to the importer as if the article were sold at retail in the jurisdiction. However, tax is not imposed on the importer if Louisiana tax was previously paid or if the importer properly claims a credit for tax paid to another state or local jurisdiction. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:303(A); La. Admin. Code tit. 61, §4307(A). Moreover, Louisiana regulations provide that use tax is imposed on tangible personal property used, consumed, or distributed, stored for use or consumption in the state, if Louisiana sales tax has not been paid “for any reason whatsoever.” La. Admin. Code tit. 61, §4303(A). Motor Vehicles Purchased by Military Personnel Stationed in Louisiana Louisiana exempts from sales and use tax motor vehicles purchased in another state by qualified military personnel stationed in Louisiana. To qualify, the military personnel must be a resident of the state where the vehicle was purchased and must have paid that state's tax. The military personnel is allowed a credit for the taxes paid to the state where the vehicle was purchased. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:305.48. BNA-SUTN LA 4.3.1.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Temporary Presence, In-Transit Property Tangible Personal Property Temporarily Stored In-state

Depends Tax is imposed on tangible personal property that was purchased in or imported into Louisiana and stored in the state as exempt property to be first used offshore, if such property is ultimately used in another state. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 47:305.10(D); La. Admin. Code tit. 61, §4410. However, the storage in Louisiana and withdrawal from storage of property for first use beyond the territorial limits of any state is not considered a taxable use. La. Admin. Code tit. 61, §4410(F). BNA-SUTN LA 4.3.2.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Temporary Presence, In-Transit Property Tangible Personal Property Purchased for Use Out-of-state

Nontaxable Louisiana does not impose sales or use tax on the sale or use of tangible personal property, including diesel fuel, that is purchased or imported in the state for first use exclusively outside Louisiana. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 47:305.10(A). Where the first use occurs in a state that imposes a sales or use tax, the exemption applies only if:• the purchaser is registered to collect, report and pay sales and use tax in the other state; and • the other state grants a reciprocal exemption on purchases made within that state for use in Louisiana; and • the purchaser obtains authority to make nontaxable purchases from the Louisiana Department of Revenue; or the property is subject to registration as a motor boat in Louisiana and such property is not registered for use in Louisiana. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 47:305.10(B). Where the first use occurs offshore beyond the territorial limits of any state, the exemption applies only if: 1)the purchaser or importer has determined the location of the first use of the tangible personal property at the time of its purchase and has notified the vendor of that location; or 2) the purchaser or importer has not determined the intended offshore location of first use at the time of purchase or importation, but has obtained from the Secretary of Revenue an “offshore registration number”authorizing him to claim the exemption under certain condition. Where neither of the foregoing conditions are met, the purchase or importation of property in Louisiana is taxable at the time of purchase or importation, unless another exemption applies. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 47:305.10(C); La. Admin. Code tit. 61, §4410(E). If tangible personal property exempt as property to be first used offshore is subsequently used for any taxable purpose in Louisiana, use tax is due at the time of the property's use in the state. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 47:305.10(D); La. Admin. Code tit. 61, §4410. Additionally, use tax is due on property exempt under the first use provisions that is later returned to Louisiana for use for a taxable purpose, although a credit may be available for tax paid to another state. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 47:305.10(E); La. Admin. Code tit. 61, §4410. Additionally, tangible personal property purchased and stored in the state that is clearly labeled for shipment beyond the territorial limits of the state is not subject to sales and use tax. The exemption applies even if the property is stored in Louisiana for an indefinite period. However, sales and use tax is imposed if the property is diverted to the taxpayer's own use or disposition within the state, as such property is no longer considered to be in interstate commerce. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 47:305(E); Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin No. 16-034 (July 14, 2016). Moreover, tangible personal property that is leased or rented for use and is actually used in an offshore area beyond the state's territorial limits is not subject to Louisiana's sales or lease tax. La. Admin. Code tit. 61, §4303(B)(2)(c); Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin No. 16-034 (July 14, 2016). Leased property that is used both in interstate commerce and intrastate commerce in Louisiana is subject to tax only on that portion of the lease payments attributable to the use within Louisiana. The “average operational usage” attributable to Louisiana is determined using a ratio, the numerator of which is the total intrastate use, and the denominator of which is total combined intrastate and interstate usage. If the 90 percent or more of the average operational usage for a lease payment billing period is attributable to Louisiana, the total lease payments for that period are subject to Louisiana tax. If only 10 percent or less of the usage for a billing period is attributable to Louisiana, the property is deemed to be used exclusively in interstate commerce and is not subject to Louisiana tax for that billing period. La. Admin. Code tit. 61, §4303(B)(2)(b); Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin No. 16-034 (July 14, 2016). Louisiana provides sales tax refunds to international visitors that purchase tangible items from tax-free stores and then permanently remove them from the United States. There is no refund for sales tax paid for personal services, such as hotels, restaurants, entertainment, and transportation. Louisiana Dept. of Rev., Louisiana's First Cultural Shopping Trail Launched by the Louisiana Tax Free Shopping Commission (Nov. 14, 2017); Louisiana Tax Free Shopping for International Visitors. Certain Passenger Aircraft Effective July 1, 2018, sales of Louisiana-manufactured or Louisiana-assembled passenger aircraft with a maximum capacity of eight persons, where the aircraft is ultimately received by the purchaser outside of Louisiana are exempt from sales and use tax. This exemption was extended from July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2025. Prior to July 1, 2018, sales tax applied to these transactions at the following rates:• from July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2018: 3 percent; • from April 1, 2016, through June 30, 2016: 5 percent; and • from July 1, 2013, through March 31, 2016: 0 percent (exempt).
