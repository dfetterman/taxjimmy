Topic: Administration and Procedure Vendor/Seller Registration

Required Generally, vendors that wish to engage in retail sales in Ohio are required to obtain a license. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.17(A). An application must be filed with the county auditor and a license fee of $25 must be submitted to the county treasury of each county in which the vendor will maintain a fixed place of business and that will be the situs of retail sales by the vendor. The county auditor will then issue a license for each fixed place of business designated in the application, utilizing a system provided and maintained by the tax commissioner. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.17(A); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.18, as added by Ohio 2017 H.B. 49, effective Sept. 29, 2017. The Department of Taxation will publish, on its website, a list of each holder of a vendor's license that includes the licensee's business address, account number and active or inactive license status. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.18, as added by Ohio 2017 H.B. 49, effective Sept. 29, 2017. Further sellers of tangible personal property or services with a substantial nexus with Ohio are generally required to register with the tax commissioner and provide information concerning any contacts with Ohio that may be required by the Commissioner. However, sellers who are licensed vendors in Ohio are not required to register with the commissioner providing all sales to Ohio consumers are made under the seller's license. Additionally seller's with no contact with Ohio other than an agency relationship with a telemarketing business within Ohio for the purposes of soliciting consumers in states other than Ohio unless such seller has established substantial nexus with Ohio through Ohio's click through nexus provision under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.01(I)(2)(g). Finally, Ohio does not require sellers to register with the commissioner when their only contact with Ohio is the ownership of property located at an Ohio based printing facility which the seller has contracted with for the printing of items that consisting the final printed product, property that becomes a part of the final printed product, or templates from which the final printed product is produced. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.17(A); see also the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Ohio 3.1.2.3. Registration of Transient Vendors A transient vendor may apply to the Tax Commissioner for a transient vendor's license. To receive the transient vendor's license, the transient vendor must submit an application along with$25 to the Tax Commissioner. The license permits a transient vendor to make retail sales in any county in which the vendor does not maintain a fixed place of business. The transient vendor is required to display the license or a copy of the license in plain view at every place of business. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.17(B) and (E). Registration of Service Vendors A service vendor must submit an application along with a $25 license fee to the Tax Commissioner before the vendor may sell taxable services. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.17(C). Registration of Delivery Vendors A delivery vendor must submit an application along with a $25 license fee for each delivery vendor license to the Tax Commissioner. The delivery vendor license permits a delivery vendor to make retail sales throughout the state. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.17(D). See Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.01(B)(3)(e-m),(p), (t). Exceptions to the License Requirement Ohio provides that when a licensed partnership is dissolved by reason of the death of one of the partners, the surviving partner may continue to operate under the partnership's license for a period of 60 days. Further, Ohio allows the heirs or legal representatives of a deceased license holder to operate under the license of the deceased. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.17(A)(1), (A)(2). Additionally, under Ohio law, a license issued to a business entity other than a partnership operated by two or more persons is not affected by the retirement of any person from the business or the entrance of any new person under the existing agreement. A new license is not required in order for the new participants to continue operating the business unless the person retiring is the named individual on the license. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.17(A)(3). Suspension of Vendor Licenses The tax commissioner may suspend the license of any vendor that fails to file the required monthly sales tax returns in two consecutive months or in three or more months within a twelve-month period. For semiannual filers, suspension is permitted if the vendor fails to file on two or more occasions within 24 months. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.30. The commissioner may also suspend the license of any vendor that fails to file returns and make payments of income tax withheld from employees as required under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5747.07.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Tax Collection and Remittance

Vendor All persons that maintain a place of business in Ohio must collect and remit sales and use taxes. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.12; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.30; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.12. Vendors are not relieved of liability when they enter into management agreements with other businesses who operate the vendors' businesses. See Painter v. Testa, No. 2015-111 (Ohio B.T.A. 2016) (taxpayer who entered into agreements with different management companies to operate his business was liable for sales taxes that were assessed for periods when the management companies were in charge of the business; the taxpayer still retained control over fiscal obligations of the business although he was not involved in day to day operations). An individual assessed as a responsible party may not challenge underlying corporate liability through a responsible party assessment. Derouchie v. Testa, Ohio Board of Tax Appeals Decision No. 2017-1264 (Sept. 5, 2018). See Nusseibah v. Zaino, 784 N.E. 2d 93 (Ohio 2003) (concerning derivative personal liability, the Board of Tax Appeals is only concerned with the liability of the person assessed; once an assessment has been made against a corporation and the assessment has become conclusive, corporate officers are bound by their fiscal responsibilities towards the corporation); Columbus Cleaning Sols., Inc. v. Testa, No. 2015-347 (Ohio B.T.A. 2015) (appellant's notice of appeal concerned the underlying corporation's participation in a payment plan to satisfy its outstanding sales tax obligations; the Board found no case in controversy and properly dismissed the appeal as the payment plan did not constitute a settlement of the outstanding tax obligation and was not a release of the corporation or any of its responsible officers); Houser v. Testa, No. 2015-221 (Ohio Bd. Tax App. Nov. 30, 2015) (appeal concerned the corporate assessment;thus, the board did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal). Where an individual assessed as the responsible party enters into a voluntary repayment plan on behalf of the corporation, the individual assessed is not precluded from outstanding tax liability. The payment plan is not a release of the corporation or any of its responsible officers. Columbus Cleaning Sols., Inc. v. Testa, No. 2015-347 (Ohio B.T.A. Sept. 11, 2015). However, failure of service of the corporate assessment invalidates a derivative responsible party assessment. As a result, where an assessment has been made against an individual as a responsible party, the individual may contest the personal assessment against themselves by challenging the service of the corporate assessment on the corporation. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.33; Cruz v. Testa, 2015 BL 266381 (Ohio 2015). When the corporate assessments were properly served according to statutory requirements, derivative liability of responsible persons is proper. Cruz v. Testa, 41 N.E.3d 1213, 2015 BL 266381, 144 Ohio St. 3d 221 (Ohio 2015). BNA-SUTN OH 31.3.1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Purchaser Liability

Yes The person using, storing, or consuming a taxable item in Ohio is liable for use tax on that item, unless sales tax was paid to the seller at the time of the purchase. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.02(B). A purchaser's liability for use tax continues until the tax is paid over to the state. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.02(B). However, a purchaser is not liable for unpaid sales tax if the purchaser or the seller of the property relied on erroneous data provided by the state on tax rates, boundaries, taxing jurisdiction requirements, or in Ohio's Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Taxability Matrix. Ohio Admin. Code §5703-9-58(A). BNA-SUTN OH 31.3.2.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Business Owners, Operators

Yes Generally, an individual signing a return is presumed to be the person responsible for payment of the tax and is subject to personal assessment for any unpaid tax deficiencies. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.33; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.21. However, if a corporation, limited liability company, business trust, or holder of a direct pay permit fails to file a return or remit the tax due on a return, then Ohio holds personally liable for any unpaid tax employees who control or supervise the filing and paying of returns, or any officers, members, managers, or trustees who are responsible for the execution of fiscal responsibilities. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.33; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.21; Singh v. Testa, Ohio Board of Tax Appeals Decision No. 2017-1160 (Sept. 10, 2018) (petitioner responsible for sales tax assessment for the period after a court ordered them to transfer ownership to another, because the order did not discuss tax liability and it was unclear when the transfer of ownership actually occurred); Ohio Board of Tax Appeals Decision No. 2016-694 (April 14, 2017) (majority shareholder held liable as a responsible party for unpaid sales tax of company despite testifying that he withdrew from the business and sold his shares prior to accrual of the tax debt. Board rejected shareholder's claim of disassociation because he did not produce any documentary evidence to support his testimony); Beachland Enterprises Inc. v. City of Cleveland Board of Review, 2013 Ohio 5585 (Ohio Ct. App. 2013) (Cleveland admissions tax assessment upheld against president of corporation deemed responsible officer); Wilson v. Testa, No. 2013-1349 (Ohio B.T.A. 2014) (despite not controlling day-to-day activities of the business, taxpayer found liable as the partner in charge of financial obligations); Kingery v. Testa, No. 2012-890 (Ohio Bd. Tax App. Jan. 27, 2015) (individual working for a leasing company was not liable as a responsible party because she was an independent contractor, not an employee of the company); Leishman v. Testa, No. 2013-6262 (Ohio Bd. Tax App. Feb. 3, 2015) (taxpayer found to have financial responsibility for business, as evidenced by her signing checks, filing sales tax returns, and being listed as president of the store's ownership entity;delegating day-to-day business responsibilities to another person does not relieve responsibility under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.33). An individual assessed tax as a responsible person of a corporation, limited liability company, or business trust required to file returns may not challenge the underlying assessment against the business, where the business itself failed to do so. The individual may only challenge her status as a responsible person. See Ohio Board of Tax Appeals Decision No. 2018-180 (Jan. 17, 2019). At the time that a business is sold or the owner resigns, a final return must be filed within 15 days. Until the former owner produces a sales tax receipt, representing that the taxes were paid or that none were due, the purchaser is permitted to withhold an amount of purchase money to cover the taxes, interest and penalties due. If the purchaser fails to withhold this money, the purchaser may be held personally liable for any unpaid taxes or penalties. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.14. BNA-SUTN OH 31.3.3.

Relief under this division from liability does not apply to any of the following:• a vendor that fraudulently fails to collect tax; • a vendor that solicits consumers to participate in the unlawful claim of an exemption; • a vendor that accepts an exemption certificate from a consumer that claims an exemption based on who purchases or who sells property or a service, when the subject of the transaction sought to be covered by the exemption certificate is actually received by the consumer at a location operated by the vendor in this state, and this state has posted to its web site an exemption certificate form that clearly and affirmatively indicates that the claimed exemption is not available in this state; or • a vendor that accepts an exemption certificate from a consumer who claims a multiple points of use exemption, if the item purchased is tangible personal property, other than prewritten computer software. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.03(B)(1)(b); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.02(E); Ohio Admin. Code §5703-9-57. BNA-SUTN OH 31.8.4.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Timely Acceptance

Time of Sale The seller is relieved of liability if the seller obtains a fully completed exemption certificate at the time of the transaction. If no certificate is obtained within 90 days after the date of the transaction, the transaction is presumed taxable. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.02(E)(3). However, after the tax commissioner gives written notice of intent to levy an assessment, a seller has an additional 120 days to obtain an exemption certificate. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.02(E)(3).

The following are Exemption Certificates that are mandatory to exempt specific purchases:• Motor Vehicle Exemption Certificate Forms: • Ohio STEC MV - Motor Vehicle, Off-Highway Motorcycle or All-Purpose Vehicle Exemption Certificate. This certificate is used to claim exemption on the purchase of a motor vehicle, off-highway motorcycle or all-purpose vehicle. It must be presented to the Clerk of Courts when applying for title to the motor vehicle, off-highway motorcycle or all-purpose vehicle. • Ohio STEC IC- Motor Vehicle, Off-Highway Motorcycle, or All-Purpose Vehicle Interstate Commerce Statement. This certificate is used when a motor vehicle, off-highway motorcycle or all-purpose vehicle is to be delivered to the purchaser outside the State of Ohio pursuant to the terms of the sales agreement. It must be presented by the dealer making the interstate commerce sale to the Clerk of Courts when applying for title to the motor vehicle, off-highway motorcycle or all purpose vehicles. • Ohio STEC NR - Motor Vehicle, Off-Highway Motorcycle, or All-Purpose Vehicle Non-Resident Exemption Certificate and Affidavit. This certificate is to be used by a purchaser that is not a resident of Ohio that will immediately remove the vehicle purchased from this state and permanently title the motor vehicle, off-highway motorcycle or all-purpose vehicle in another state. It must be presented to the Clerk of Courts when applying for title to the motor vehicle, off-highway motorcycle or all-purpose vehicles.

A contractor that provides a Construction Contract Exemption Certificate signed by the contractee is protected from liability if it is later determined that the contract did not qualify for exemption. In such a case, the contractee will assume the liability for any unpaid taxes. • Ohio STEC CO- Contractor's Exemption Certificate. This certificate may be used when making purchases of materials to be incorporated into real property as part of an exempt construction contract. Unlike the Construction Contract Exemption Certificate, it is signed only by the contractor or subcontractor that is making the purchases of materials.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Direct Pay Permits

Authorized If the Tax Commissioner determines that a direct payment would improve compliance and make administration of the tax more efficient, then a direct payment permit may be authorized. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.031(A). Direct payment is available to businesses whose purchase transactions of goods or services surpass$5,000 annually and whose sales and use tax paid exceeds $250,000 annually. Ohio Information Release ST 2003-01. Use of Permit A direct pay permit holder must file by the 23rd day of each month a return for the preceding month and must pay the tax shown on the return to be due. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.031(B). Revocation or Relinquishment of Permit A direct pay permit remains valid until the holder surrenders it or the Tax Commissioner cancels it for cause. When the direct pay permit becomes invalid, the general sales and use code provisions apply for all subsequent purchases. Moreover, a taxpayer whose direct pay permit is relinquished or revoked must provide written notification of the direct pay permit termination to vendors and sellers from whom purchases are made. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.031(F). BNA-SUTN OH 31.8.10.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Record-Keeping Requirements

4 Years Ohio sales and use taxpayers, including out-of-state vendors that sell within Ohio, are required to keep complete and accurate records for four years. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.11; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.15; Ohio Admin. Code §5703-9-02. Among the records that must be maintained are primary and secondary records. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.11; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.15; Ohio Admin. Code §5703-9-02. Primary records are described as purchase invoices, bills of lading, sales invoices, guest checks, exemption certificates, tax payment receipts, and cash register tapes. Secondary records are described as bank deposit receipts and day books, journals, or any other records in which accumulated data is recorded. Moreover, vendors must keep exemption certificates. The four-year record keeping requirement may be lowered or extended if authorized by the Tax Commissioner in writing. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.11; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.15; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.03; Ohio Admin. Code §5703-9-02; see Manes v. Testa, No. 2013-5590 (Ohio Bd. Tax App. Sept. 2, 2014) (taxpayer failure to maintain complete and accurate records cited as support for deciding in favor of audit results and assessed penalties). Failure to maintain primary records will enable the Tax Commissioner to either: (1) determine the taxable and nontaxable sales and impose tax based on the Code's described tax bracket or(2) determine the net receipts as the basis for application of the 4 percent tax levied. The Tax Commissioner will be aided in his analysis by using purchase records, sampling of the vendors business activity for a representative period, or information relating to the sales made by such vendor. Failure to maintain secondary records results in the Tax Commissioner using a sample of the vendor's business activity for a representative period to determine the rate of tax. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.11; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.15; Ohio Admin. Code §5703-9-02. “Net receipts” means the total amount of the prices of all sales less (a) the sale price of property returned by the consumers when the full price of tax has been refunded either in cash or by credit,(b) sales under $0.16, and (c) sales of food for human consumption off the premises where sold. Food Service Vendors Vendors conducting food service operators, who have not been convicted of a criminal violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.99, can keep 14 days of sales records per calendar quarter in lieu of keeping records of all sales from their food service operation. If the vendor elects not to retain records of all sales, the records of sales made on 14 days out of each quarter, as specified by the Tax Commissioner after the quarter is over, are required to be kept for the four-year statutory period. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.99;Ohio Dept. of Taxn., Record Retention Notice (Third Quarter 2018 retention dates);Ohio Dept. of Taxn., Record Retention Notice (Second Quarter 2018 retention dates). Restaurants and Bars If a restaurant or bar claims that alcoholic beverages were lost to spillage, breakage or pilferage, the business must have specific documentation to account for lost product. Specific documentation accepted to show spillage, breakage or pilferage includes a daily summary documenting alcoholic beverages lost to breakage or spillage showing the number of containers lost by size, brand or type of drink and size. Ohio Dept. of Taxn., Sales/Use Tax for Alcoholic Beverages in a Bar or Restaurant (September 2015). BNA-SUTN OH 31.9.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Refunds

Both Ohio vendors are eligible for refunds for taxes paid if the vendor has refunded to the consumer the full amount of taxes the consumer paid illegally or erroneously. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.07; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.10; Clerac, LLC v. Testa, Ohio Board of Tax Appeals Decision No. 2018-216 (Sept. 10, 2018). Vendors may also be refunded if they have illegally or erroneously billed the consumer but not yet collected the taxes from the consumer. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.07; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.10. Consumers are eligible for refunds for illegal or erroneous taxes paid as well. The commissioner is required to refund consumers taxes paid illegally or erroneously providing:• the commissioner has not refunded the tax to the vendor and the vendor has not refunded the tax to the consumer; or • the consumer has received a refund of the full purchase price, but not the tax from a manufacturer or other person, other than the vendor, in a settlement of a complaint by the consumer. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.07; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.10. BNA-SUTN OH 31.10.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Statute of Limitations Refund Requests

4 Years A taxpayer may apply for a refund by filing an application with the Tax Commissioner within four years from the time of the payment of the contested tax. The Commissioner will determine the amount of the refund that the applicant is entitled. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.07; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.10; see also City Tan LLC v. Testa, Ohio Board of Tax Appeals Decision No. 2017-579 (April 23, 2018) (granting refund for erroneously remitted sales tax, but only for the period of four years prior to filing the refund request). However, the vendor or consumer may waive the four-year statute of limitation and the refund period will be extended for the time of the waiver. The option to waive the four-year statute of limitations is only available in cases where the commissioner has issued an assessment against a vendor or consumer; refunds of voluntary tax payments by a vendor that were later determined to be erroneous are subject to the standard four-year period. See The Cornerstone Shop Inc. v. Testa, No. 2015-385 (Ohio Bd. Tax App. Dec. 14, 2015) (taxpayer could not request a waiver of the four-year statute of limitations period because he had not been assessed additional tax and was simply requesting a refund of tax he had voluntarily paid; a refund was only available for the portion of the claim still within the four-year statute of limitations period). Effective Sept. 17, 2014, the tax commissioner is required to review taxpayer accounts no later than sixty days before the expiration of the period of time during which a taxpayer may file a refund application for a tax or fee. The tax commissioner must notify the taxpayer of any credit account balance in the taxpayer's favor, and must issue a refund for the credit account balance, regardless of whether the taxpayer files a refund application or amended return. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5703.77, enacted by 2014 Ohio S.B. 263, effective Sept. 17, 2014. BNA-SUTN OH 31.11.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Statute of Limitations Assessment of Additional Tax

4 Years Ohio may assess additional sales tax within four years of the due date for the taxable period or the date that the return is actually filed, whichever is later. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.16(A). The statute of limitations does not bar an assessment for taxable periods if the tax commissioner has substantial evidence of amounts of taxes collected by a vendor from consumers on retail sales that were not returned to the state, or if a return was never filed. Further, the statute of limitations does not bar assessment when the vendor or the consumer waive the time limitation in writing in conjunction with the Commissioner. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.16(A)(1); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.16(A)(2); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.16(A)(3). BNA-SUTN OH 31.11.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Voluntary Disclosure Relief

Yes The Ohio Department of Taxation Sales and Use Tax Division provides for the voluntary disclosure of sales and use tax liability to allow businesses to resolve a tax liability without the risk of the consequences normally associated with an audit. Ohio Sales and Use Tax Voluntary Disclosure; Ohio Sales and Use Tax Voluntary Disclosure Programs - Checklist. To be eligible for the disclosure, taxpayers must notify the Sales and Use Tax Division prior to audit contact, tax discovery, or criminal investigation. Ohio Sales and Use Tax Voluntary Disclosure; Ohio Sales and Use Tax Voluntary Disclosure Programs - Checklist. To initiate a voluntary disclosure, the taxpayer submits a written proposal to the Sales and Use Tax Division, notifying the Division of intentions to make a disclosure. This notification will defer any audit action being taken, which will not be continued unless no voluntary disclosure agreement is reached. The proposal must contain statements concerning the following issues:• what is being sold and the typical nature of the transactions; • how the products are marketing in Ohio or a description of any other nexus creating activity, including the date the activity began; • if tax has been collected; • tax liability for purchases as well as sales; and • any contacts the taxpayer has had with the Division of Sales and Use Tax with regard to an audit or investigation. Ohio Sales and Use Tax Voluntary Disclosure. To complete a disclosure, the taxpayer is required to register and be in compliance with Ohio sales and use tax law. The taxpayer is also under the duty to pay all tax collected from customers. If the tax was collected but not remitted, there is no limitation on the look-back period. If tax should have been collected but was not, or if tax is due on purchase, the tax and interest must be resolved for a limited period based on the effective date of nexus. The taxpayer will have several options for payment of the tax and interest, including the following:• a voluntary payment of the tax (taxpayer is free to bill their Ohio customers), including a county breakdown (if none is available, the Division of Sales and Use Tax will determine the rate) and interest; • taxpayer can bill their Ohio customers and turn the collected tax and interest over, and include transaction information on sales where the Ohio customer did not respond or claimed exemption; or • the taxpayer provides the Sales and Use Tax Division with the customer transactions in an acceptable electronic format for disposition by the Division. Ohio Sales and Use Tax Voluntary Disclosure. In exchange for the taxpayer coming forth voluntarily, the Sales and Use Tax Division, agrees to the following:• waiver of civil and criminal penalties; • waiver of filing requirements prior to registration; • waiver of audits prior to the disclosure period; • avoidance of voluntary disclosure of the taxpayer's identity to other parties;and • allowing for anonymity of the taxpayer until closing of the disclosure agreement. Ohio Sales and Use Tax Voluntary Disclosure. BNA-SUTN OH 31.15.1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Voluntary Disclosure Look-Back Periods

Depends Ohio's sales and use tax voluntary disclosure program has a look-back period that varies depending on the date when a company began nexus-creating activities. Also, there is no limitation to the look-back period if tax has been collected from customers but the tax has not been remitted. Ohio Sales and Use Tax Voluntary Disclosure. BNA-SUTN OH 31.15.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Voluntary Disclosure Multistate Tax Commission (MTC) Program

Does Not Participate Ohio does not participate in the Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program(MVDP). Multistate Tax Commission, Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program. The MVDP allows taxpayers with outstanding tax liabilities in multiple states to negotiate settlements via a process coordinated by the National Nexus Program (NNP) staff of the MTC. Multistate Tax Commission, Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program. To participate in the MVDP, the taxpayer must:• have a minimum good-faith tax liability estimate of $500 or more; • not have been contacted by a state or commission regarding taxes due;and • submit a completed Voluntary Disclosure Agreement (VDA) including taxpayer's contact information, tax year, list of states to receive the proposed VDA, description of taxpayer's activities in each state, and estimate of taxes due. Multistate Tax Commission, Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program. The program is intended to incentivize taxpayers to begin filing and paying taxes in all of the states in which they have substantial nexus. Upon entering into a voluntary disclosure agreement with a state, taxpayers will be required to file returns, pay the tax due and accrued interest on the returns, and register with the state in exchange for waiver of penalties for the entire look-back period. Taxpayers are not charged to participate in the MVDP. BNA-SUTN OH 31.15.3.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Audits

Authorized The Ohio Department of Taxation is authorized to audit any transaction for which a sales or use tax was due and unpaid and issue an assessment based on the audit. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.13(A). In general, Ohio presumes that all sales and uses are subject to Ohio sales and use tax. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.02(C); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.02(G). If no return is made, or the Commissioner has evidence that the taxpayer failed to collect or remit sales or use tax, the Tax Commissioner may suspend the vendor's license or require the vendor to furnish a security in amount equal to the average tax liability of the vendor for a period of one year. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.30. Moreover, the department of taxation may make an assessment against the taxpayer. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.13; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.13; see, e.g., North Main Mini-Mart Inc. v. Testa, No. 2012-A-2326 (Ohio Bd. Tax App. March 8, 2013) (audit identifying tax due from customer purchases was upheld because taxpayer could not provide a truly representative sample of purchases for purposes of the audit, and on appeal, failed to provide competent and probative evidence to demonstrate that the Tax Commissioner's findings were incorrect.) The assessment is made after the Commissioner audits a representative sample of the consumer's purchases or the vendor's sales. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.13; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.13; 123 Food Mart, Inc. v. Testa (Ohio B.T.A. 2015) (taxpayer assessment upheld because taxpayer failed to provide adequate corporate sales and tax collection records, making the tax commissioner's mark-up analysis necessary to determine the amount of taxes that should have been collected and remitted); I & I Food, Inc. v. Testa (Ohio B.T.A. 2015) (taxpayer failed to present complete and accurate sales and tax collection records and the parties agreed that the sample documentation provided was representative of the business activity for the entire audit period, therefore the denial of abatement and penalty were upheld); Dagher v. Testa (Ohio B.T.A. 2015) (taxpayer's net sales figures based on monthly bank statements did not provide the specificity required to demonstrate sales activity, therefore the commissioner was required to gather information from other sources to estimate the amount of taxes which should have been collected and remitted and the assessment against the taxpayer was upheld). Audit Types When the Tax Commissioner does not have adequate records to determine the tax rate for the taxpayer's total sales a “test check” audit procedure is applied. The test checks determine the proportion that taxable retail sales bear to all of the vendor's retail sales and the ratio the tax required to be collected under the Ohio Revised Code bears to the receipts from the vendor's taxable retail sales. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.05; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.13; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.13. Vendors must keep complete and accurate records of sales, along with records of the tax collected on those sales. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.11. In the absence of such records, the commissioner may gather information from other sources during an audit in order to estimate the amount of taxes that should have been collected and remitted. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.13. See Ohio Board of Tax Appeals Decision No. 2016-951 (May 22, 2017); Ohio Board of Tax Appeals Decision No. 2016-953 (May 22, 2017); Saim Inc. v. Testa (Ohio B.T.A. 2016) (use of a mark-up analysis was proper; taxpayer never signed the memorandum of agreement to use that audit method and did not provide an alternate methodology); NNP of Ohio, Inc. v. Testa, No. 2014-4691 (Ohio Bd. Tax App. Oct. 15, 2015) (the commissioner used a mark-up analysis to estimate taxable sales for the audit period because the taxpayer did not have accurate records; taxpayer could not prove that the commissioner's findings were erroneous without complete records). In auditing a restaurant or bar, a mark-up audit procedure may be used to calculate sales and use tax liability for alcoholic beverages. With this technique, third-party information from beverage distributors is used to verify purchases and compute the mark-up on cost. Ohio Dept. of Taxn., Sales/Use Tax for Alcoholic Beverages in a Bar or Restaurant (September 2015). See Ohio Board of Tax Appeals Decision No. 2016-913 (April 21, 2017) (taxpayer seeking remission of audit penalty was unable to challenge the manner in which the audit was conducted, specifically the markup analysis, because the taxpayer agreed in writing to use of the methodology by signing a Memorandum of Agreement prior to the audit). If a taxpayer is able to show that all appropriate records may not have been considered during an audit, the commissioner will have to vacate a final determination and issue a new determination after all records are considered. Castle's Gas & Deli LLC v. Testa (Ohio B.T.A. 2016) (auditor may not have considered all relevant records during the audit period;the final determination was vacated and a new determination was needed after all records were considered). Audit Findings After an audit is complete, the Department of Taxation must given written notice of an assessment to the taxpayer. The notice of assessment provides instructions on how to petition for reassessment and request a hearing within 60 days of the notice. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.13; Ohio Rev.

An appellant is permitted to amend the notice within sixty days after the certification of the transcript without consent from the board of appeals. After 60 days the notice may only be amended after receiving leave of the board or written consent of each party. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5717.02. The notice of appeal must contain a statement identifying the claimed errors in the commissioner's determination or redetermination for which the appellant is entitled to relief and a demand for such relief. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5717.02. See Saood, Inc. v. Testa, Ohio Board of Tax Appeals Decision No. 2017-1989 (April 30, 2018) and Congress Family Plowing & Landscaping, LLC v. Testa, Ohio Board of Tax Appeals Decision No. 2017-653 (April 18, 2018) (where taxpayer did not set forth any claimed error regarding a determination, taxpayer's appeal was dismissed); see also 6101 W. 3rd St. Invs., Inc. v. Testa (Ohio B.T.A. 2016) (Board of Tax Appeals dismissed matter because taxpayer's notice of appeal contested the amount of sales tax assessed, an issue not raised in its petition for reassessment filed with the Tax Commission, and thus not addressed in the Commissioner's final determination); Liscoe v. Testa (Ohio B.T.A. 2016) (Board of Tax Appeals remanded use tax matter to Tax Commissioner for consideration of evidence taxpayer presented to the Board but did not submit to the Commissioner prior to the final determination). The Ohio Board of Tax Appeals cannot rely upon an appellant's contentions in its notice of appeal alone, without evidence and/or testimony in the record to support its position, because ‘the notice of appeal merely constitutes unsworn, unproven statements, claims and allegations.' First Merit Equipment Finance, Inc. v. Testa, Ohio Board of Tax Appeals Decision No. 2017-1305 (Sept. 6, 2018); Tedia Company Inc. v.

Because the findings of the Tax Commissioner are presumptively valid, it is the appellant's burden to provide competent and probative evidence to demonstrate that the Tax Commissioner's findings are incorrect. The board will not do the appellant's work of evaluating documentary evidence to determine its applicability. Ohio Board of Tax Appeals Decision No. 2017-853 (June 8, 2018) (finding that taxpayer did not meet its burden on appeal to demonstrate error in the commissioner's determination because taxpayer failed to submit reliable documentary and testimonial evidence); Ohio Board of Tax Appeals Decision No. 2017-376 (Feb. 12, 2018) (an appellant may not present evidence to the Board of Tax Appeals that was not previously presented in earlier proceedings); Ohio Board of Tax Appeals Decision No. 2016-912 (May 22, 2017); Ohio Board of Tax Appeals Decision No. 2016-951 (May 22, 2017); Ohio Board of Tax Appeals Decision No. 2016-953 (May 22, 2017).

Ohio Board of Tax Appeals Decision No. 2016-912 (May 22, 2017). Any legal argument made by a non-attorney CPA on behalf of an appellant constitutes the unauthorized practice of law and will be stricken by the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals.

Judicial Appeals Currently, Ohio Board of Tax Appeals decisions may be appealed to an Ohio court of appeals within 30 days after the date of entry of the board decision Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5717.04. Effective Sept. 12, 2018, taxpayers wishing to challenge BTA decisions of appeals from final determinations of the Ohio Tax Commissioner related to tax assessments, reassessments, valuations, determinations, findings, computation, or orders made by the commissioner, may file an appeal with either the Ohio Supreme Court or an Ohio court of appeals.
