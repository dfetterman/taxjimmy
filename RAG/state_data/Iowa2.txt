Topic: Administration and Procedure Agencies Responsible for Administration Local Sales and Use Tax

Iowa Department of Revenue The Iowa Department of Revenue is responsible for administering the Iowa local option sales and services tax. Iowa Code Ann. §423B.6(2)(a). The Director of the Department of Revenue must administer the local sales and services tax in a similar manner to state sales tax laws, and must provide the forms necessary for reporting local sales and services tax liability. Iowa Code Ann. §423B.6(2)(a). In order to provide up to date information regarding changes in the local option sales and services tax, the Department of Revenue will contact local business through email newsletters and notices if the business has signed up for these notices on the Department of Revenue's website. See Iowa Dept. of Rev., Local Option Sales Tax Questions and Answers. Businesses are responsible for the cost of reprogramming their business infrastructure to accurately calculate the local option sales tax. See Iowa Dept. of Rev., Local Option Sales Tax Questions and Answers. Retail vendors are not required to hold an additional permit to collect the local option tax, but only are required to hold the basic state sales tax permit. Iowa Code Ann. §423B.5; Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-107.5, as amended by 41 Iowa Admin. Bull. No. 18 (Feb. 27, 2019), effective April 3, 2019. Iowa law authorizes county governments to impose local option sales and services taxes upon the gross receipts derived from sales of tangible personal property within the county, or upon services rendered within the county. There is no local option use tax under Iowa law. Iowa Code Ann. §423B.1(1); Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-107.6, as amended by 41 Iowa Admin. Bull. No. 18 (Feb. 27, 2019), effective April 3, 2019. In some limited circumstances, where a city's corporate boundaries include areas within two Iowa counties, a city may impose a local option tax. Iowa Code Ann. §423B.1(2), as amended by 2018 Iowa S.F. 2417, §232, effective Jan. 1, 2019; Iowa Admin. Code r. 721-21.804, as amended by 41 Iowa Admin. Bull., No. 24 (May 22, 2019), effective June 26, 2019. The imposition, rate change, use change, or repeal of the local tax must be approved by the voters in the jurisdiction to be taxed. The citizens of the jurisdiction may initiate the election through petition to the county board of supervisors to provide written notice to the county commissioner of elections. Iowa Admin. Code r. 721-21.800(1). The governing bodies of cities or towns may also initiate the election through motions filed with the county auditor. Iowa Admin. Code r. 721-21.800(2). Remittance of the Local Option Tax Since the Iowa Department of Revenue uses a combined state sales and local option tax return, taxpayers must properly designate the portion of the combined remitted payment relating to the local option tax due. Iowa Code Ann. §421.60(2)(d). If not properly designated, the payment received will be apportioned between the state and local sales taxes due based on a ratio formula. The ratio for applying all payments received with the return and all subsequent payments for the given tax period will be based upon the calculated total of state sales and local option sales and service tax due for the given tax period in relation to the combined total payment of sales and local option sales and service tax actually received for that tax period. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-107.10, as amended by 41 Iowa Admin. Bull. No. 18 (Feb. 27, 2019), effective April 3, 2019. However, effective July 1, 2014, taxpayers are no longer required to provide “Sales by County” information on annual sales and use tax returns. 2013 Iowa S.F. 452, effective July 1, 2014; Iowa Dept. of Rev., Sales by County Eliminated from Sales/Use Tax Returns. Construction Contractor Refunds As of May 4, 1988, construction contractors may apply for refund of additional local option sales or service tax paid on goods, wares, or merchandise as a result of the imposition of or an increase in the rate of local option tax if the following circumstances exist: Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-107.3(4)(a) and Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-107.16, as rescinded by 41 Iowa Admin. Bull. No. 18 (Feb. 27, 2019), effective April 3, 2019. • The goods, wares or merchandise are incorporated into an improvement to real estate in fulfillment of a written contract fully executed prior to the date of the imposition or increase in rate of the local option tax. Contractors may not apply for a refund relating to equipment transferred in fulfillment of a mixed contract; • The contractor has paid to the department or to a retailer the full amount of the state and local option tax; and • Prior to July 1, 2001, the claim must be filed on forms provided by the department and must be filed within six months of the date the tax is paid. Effective July 1, 2001, the claim for refund must be filed with the department within one year from the date the tax is paid. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-107.16(1), as rescinded by 41 Iowa Admin. Bull. No. 18 (Feb. 27, 2019), effective April 3, 2019. Officers and Partners Liability Any corporate officer or partnership partner with control, supervision, or authority over remitting local option sales tax is personally liable for payment of the local option sales tax, interest, and penalties when the business intentionally fails to pay the tax due to the Department of Revenue. However, personal liability does not extend to unpaid local option taxes attributable to accounts receivable. The dissolution of a business does not discharge personal liability for failure to pay tax. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-12.15. BNA-SUTN IA 31.1.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Vendor/Seller Registration

Required Individuals and businesses may not engage in the business of making retail sales of tangible personal property or specified digital products or furnishing taxable services until the individual or business has been issued a sales tax permit by the Iowa Department of Revenue. Iowa Code Ann. §423.36(1), as amended by 2018 Iowa S.F. 2417, effective Jan. 1, 2019; Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-13.1. Every application for a sales tax permit must be signed by the owner of the business or other executive officer of the business and submitted with documentation of the officer's authority. Iowa Code Ann. §423.36(1), as amended by 2018 Iowa S.F. 2417, effective Jan. 1, 2019. Retailers may not collect sales or use tax without a valid permit for each place of business that they operate within Iowa. Iowa Code Ann. §423.36(2), as amended by 2018 Iowa S.F. 2417, effective Jan. 1, 2019; Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-13.1. Each permit is not assignable and is valid only for the person in whose name it is issued, and only for the transaction of business at the location designated on the permit. Iowa Code Ann. §423.36(2), as amended by 2018 Iowa S.F. 2417, effective Jan. 1, 2019; Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-13.3. Sales tax permits are valid until they are revoked by the Department of Revenue. Iowa Code Ann. §423.36(4). If a business changes locations, the same permit may be used in the new location if the new location is within Iowa and the ownership of the business has not changed. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-13.10. However, if the business changes its name or reorganizes under a new entity form, a new permit is required. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-13.11. The sales tax permit must be conspicuously posted in the taxpayer's place of business at all times. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-13.12. Retailers with a permanent location who also make sales at a temporary location are not required to hold an additional permit for each temporary location. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-12.3. However, a regular permit holder that sells merchandise by truck, canvassers, or itinerant salespeople on fixed routes must have a form in their possession or in their vehicle that authorizes the collection of tax. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-12.5. Remote Sellers and Marketplace Facilitators Effective Jan. 1, 2019, remote sellers that have $100,000 in gross revenue from Iowa sales or, before July 1, 2019, make 200 or more separate sales transactions into Iowa and marketplace facilitators that make or facilitate $100,000 or more in Iowa sales or, before July 1, 2019, make or facilitate Iowa sales in 200 or more separate transactions must get an Iowa retail sales tax permit and file sales tax returns. Iowa Dept. of Rev., Permits, Filing Requirements, and Local Option Sales Tax. However, if a business does not make any taxable retail sales, it does not need to get an Iowa sales tax permit or file Iowa sales tax returns. Iowa Dept. of Rev., Permits, Filing Requirements, and Local Option Sales Tax. Denial of a Permit The Iowa Department of Revenue may deny a permit to an applicant who is substantially delinquent in paying any tax due, or if the taxpayer had a previous delinquent tax liability owed to the Department. If the applicant is a partnership, the Department may deny a permit if any partner owes a delinquent amount of tax. Similarly, if the applicant is a corporation, the Department may deny the application for a sales tax permit if any officer having a substantial legal or equitable interest in the ownership of the corporation owes any delinquent tax or had a previous delinquent tax liability with the Department. Iowa Code Ann. §423.36(2), as amended by 2018 Iowa S.F. 2417, effective Jan. 1, 2019. Revocation of a Permit The Department of Revenue may revoke a taxpayer's sales tax permit if the permit holder fails to comply with any of the rules or regulations relating to sales or use tax. Also, the Department may revoke a taxpayer's sales tax permit if the taxpayer, or one of its corporate officers having a substantial legal or equitable interest, is delinquent in the payment of any tax, interest, or penalty administered by the Department. The Department must send notice by mail to a permit holder informing them of the Department's intent to revoke the permit and of the permit holder's right to a hearing. Iowa Code Ann. §423.36(5); Iowa Declaratory Order Docket No. 19DR0028 (June 4, 2019). A permit may also be revoked if a taxpayer or a representative fails to appear at the hearing after receiving notice, when the taxpayer has been out of compliance, and has an outstanding tax liability. Iowa Declaratory Order Docket No. 15IDR083 (Feb. 18, 2016); Iowa Declaratory Order Docket No. 16IDR002 (Feb. 18, 2016); Iowa Administrative Decision No. 15IDR064 (Oct. 21, 2015); Iowa Administrative Decision No. 15IDR051 (Oct. 21, 2015); Iowa Administrative Decision No. 15IDR080 (Oct. 21, 2015). Reissued Permits Following a Revocation If the Commissioner has revoked a retailer's sales tax permit for whatever reason, in order to have the permit reinstated the taxpayer must satisfy the following requirements: • the taxpayer must file all unfiled sales and use returns; • the taxpayer must pay the entire balance of tax, penalty, and interest due; and • the taxpayer must deposit with the Commissioner a security or surety bond. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-13.7. To have a revoked sales tax permit reinstated, the Department may also require taxpayers to take the following actions: • the taxpayer must sign a sworn affidavit, subject to the penalties of perjury, stating that the permit holder has fulfilled all requirements of said order of revocation, and stating the dates on which the permit holder refrained from taxable occurrences; and • the Department may impose a waiting period during which the permit holder must refrain from certain taxable occurrences, for a maximum of 90 days. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-13.7. Vendors Without a Permanent Place of Business Retail vendors who make taxable sales from mobile sources, such as trucks, portable roadside stands, concessionaires at fairs, or other similar sources are not required to hold a sales tax permit. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-13.5. Instead, itinerant vendors must request an identification card from the Department of Revenue. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-13.5; Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-12.4. These vendors must display the card to show authorization to collect sales tax due. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-13.5. Should the Department deem it necessary, transient or itinerant vendors may be required to post a bond or certificate of deposit. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-12.4. Markets, Trade Shows, Conventions In the context of flea markets, craft shows, convention exhibit area exhibitions, etc., the Iowa Department of Revenue imposes obligations on both the general operator/sponsor of the event and on the individual businesses that seek to do business at such an event. Event operators are required to verify that anyone at the trade show making taxable retail sales is licensed to collect sales tax by possessing an Iowa sales tax permit, whether permanent or temporary in nature. Iowa Code Ann. §423.33(3); Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-13.5; see Iowa Dept. of Rev., Iowa Sales Tax FAQs. Operators are subject to tax on the sales made at the event if they fail to obtain proof that the vendors have a valid sales tax permits or are only selling nontaxable property. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-12.16. Event operators must obtain, in good faith, a written statement from any event exhibitors who claim that property or services offered for sale are not subject to sales tax. Otherwise, event operators or sponsors may be responsible for sales tax not collected by the vendors if they do not obtain the proper information from vendors. Iowa Code Ann. §423.33(3); Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-12.16; see Iowa Dept. of Rev., Iowa Sales Tax FAQs. “Good faith” may demand that the sponsor inquire into the nature of the property or service sold or why the retailer believes the property or services for sale to be exempt from tax. A sponsor who fails to take these measures assumes all of the liabilities of a retailer. This includes not only the obligation to pay tax, penalty, and interest, but also to keep the records required of a retailer/exhibitor and to file returns. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-12.16. Sponsors of special events must notify the Department of Revenue of the planned event and must provide a list of the vendors to the Department. Event exhibitors may obtain temporary sales tax permits if they are not in business regularly. Otherwise, event exhibitors that have regular sales tax permits must remit the sales tax under their regular sales tax permit and on their usual sales tax return. See Iowa Dept. of Rev., Iowa Sales Tax FAQs. Vapor and Alternative Nicotine Products Retailers who make delivery sales of alternative nicotine and vapor products must have an Iowa sales and use tax permit and collect state sales and use tax and applicable local option sales tax, regardless of whether they are physically present in Iowa. Iowa Code Ann. §453A.47C, as added by 2017 Iowa S.F. 516, effective July 1, 2017; Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-82.12, as added by 41 Iowa Admin. Bull. No. 18 (Feb. 27, 2019), effective April 3, 2019; see Iowa Vapor and Alternative Nicotine Products -- Requirements for Delivery Sellers. BNA-SUTN IA 31.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Tax Collection and Remittance

Vendor Under Iowa law, liability for sales tax is placed on both the purchaser and the seller, unless the purchaser presents the vendor with a valid exemption certificate. Iowa Code Ann. §423.45(4)(b). Iowa requires the seller or vendor to collect sales tax from all applicable purchases and to remit the tax to the Department of Revenue. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-12.2. The sales tax charge must be separately stated on the sales invoice or it must be stated on each invoice that tax is included in the purchase price. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-14.1. If the seller fails to collect the appropriate sales tax due, then the purchaser and seller are personally liable to pay the tax. Iowa Code Ann. §423.45(4)(b); Iowa Code Ann. §423.33(1);Iowa Dept. of Rev., Don't Let Compliance be Taxing This Holiday Season. Although the Department is free to pursue either the seller or the purchaser for the unpaid tax, the tax should be paid by the purchaser directly to the Department. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-12.17. However, a seller will not be held personally liable if the seller accepts a valid exemption certificate, and complies with the following requirements: • the seller must obtain identifying information of the purchaser and the reason for claiming a tax exemption at the time of the purchase; • a purchaser is not required to provide a signature to claim an exemption from tax unless a paper certificate is used; • the seller uses the standard state form for claiming an exemption electronically; • the seller must obtain the same information for proof of a claimed exemption regardless of the medium in which the transaction occurred; and • the seller must maintain proper records of exempt transactions and provide them to the department when requested. Iowa Code Ann. §423.51(1). However, the retail vendor will not be relieved of personally liability for sales tax due if the vendor does any of the following: • fraudulently fails to collect the tax; • solicits purchasers to participate in the unlawful claim of an exemption; or • Accepts an exemption certificate when the purchaser claims an entity-based exemption when the following conditions are met: • The subject of the transaction sought to be covered by the exemption certificate is actually received by the purchaser at a location operated by the seller; and • The state provides an exemption certificate that clearly and affirmatively indicates that the claimed exemption is not available in the state. Iowa Code Ann. §423.51(2) BNA-SUTN IA 31.3.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Purchaser Liability

Yes An individual or business that uses, stores, distributes or consumes tangible personal property in Iowa is liable for use tax. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-30.3. If a purchaser does not pay use tax to a seller that is authorized to collect the tax, then the purchaser must remit the tax directly to the department on an individual use tax return. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-30.1(2). Additionally, if an item of tangible personal property has already been subject to use tax in another state in the hands of its current owner, then the use tax due is reduced by the amount of use tax previously paid to another state. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-30.7. When a person claims exemption from payment of use tax on the grounds that the tax has already been paid to another state prior to bringing it into Iowa, the burden of proof is upon that person to show the Department documentary evidence that the tax has been paid. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-30.7. BNA-SUTN IA 31.3.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Business Owners, Operators

Yes Iowa imposes personal liability for unpaid sales taxes on certain corporate officers and supervisors that are in a position of authority or control who are responsible for collecting and remitting sales taxes and who intentionally fail to do so. Iowa Code Ann. §421.26. Additionally, any corporate officer or partnership partner with control, supervision, or authority over remitting local option sales tax is personally liable for payment of the local option sales tax, interest, and penalties when the business intentionally fails to pay the tax due to the Department of Revenue. However, personal liability does not extend to unpaid local option taxes attributable to accounts receivable. The dissolution of a business does not discharge personal liability for failure to pay tax. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-12.15. Iowa imposes such liability on officers of a corporation, members of a limited liability corporation, or a partner of a partnership that have a substantial legal or equitable interest in the ownership of the corporation. Iowa Code Ann. §421.26; Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-12.15. Iowa imposes personal liability for unpaid sales taxes on certain corporate officers and supervisors that are in a position of authority or control who are responsible for collecting and remitting sales taxes and who intentionally fail to do so. This includes officers of a corporation, members of a limited liability corporation, or a partner of a partnership that have a substantial legal or equitable interest in the ownership of the corporation. Iowa Code Ann. §421.26; Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-12.15. Personal liability does not attach to sales tax due and unpaid on accounts receivable. An account receivable is an amount owed on an open account. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-12.15(2). The following factors are used to determine which officers have control of, supervision of, or the authority for remitting tax payments: • the duties of officers as outlined in the corporate bylaws; • the duties that various officers have assumed in practice; • which officers are empowered to sign checks for the corporation; • which officers hire and fire employees; and • which officers control the financial affairs of the corporation, where control refers to authority to decide which of the corporation's bills should or should not be paid and when bills should be paid. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-12.15(1). Affiliate Liability Effective Jan. 1, 2019, if any retailer required to collect and remit sales tax fails to do so, affiliates that directly, indirectly, or constructively control the retailer shall be joint and severally liable for any tax, penalty, and interest, regardless of whether the affiliate is a retailer. Iowa Code Ann. §423.33(4), as added by 2018 Iowa S.F. 2417, §214, effective Jan. 1, 2019. Successor Liability Often, when a business is sold in its entirety, the issue arises whether the business accrued unpaid sales taxes under the previous business owners. If the business that is being sold owes delinquent sales or use taxes, the state Department of Revenue likely will have filed an enforceable lien for unpaid sales taxes against the business. Later, the new business owner or ‘immediate successor’to the business assets could be liable for these unpaid sales taxes unless the successor complies with certain requirements. If these requirements are completed, the successor will avoid liability for unpaid sales and use taxes. Iowa Code Ann. §423.33(2); Iowa Code Ann. §421.28; Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-12.14. An immediate successor may not contract with the seller to assume the sales and use tax liability of a business. Because the Iowa Department of Revenue places liability on both the purchaser and seller, the liability cannot be altered by a contract to which the Department is not a party. Iowa Revenue Policy Letter No. 14300033 (Aug. 1, 2014). When an individual or other business entity arranges to purchase either the stock or assets of a previously established retailer, the purchaser must withhold a sufficient portion of the purchase price to pay the amount of any outstanding tax, interest, or penalty that is owed by the retail business that is being purchased. An immediate successor who intentionally fails to withhold this amount will be personally liable for unpaid sales taxes, interest, and penalties of the retail business that is being purchased. Iowa Code Ann. §423.33(2). If the retail business is sold jointly to more than one immediate successor, each individual successor is personally liable for failure to withhold a sufficient portion of the purchase price to cover the payment of outstanding tax liabilities, but only to the extent of the taxes, penalties, and interest owed, or the amount of the individual purchase price, whichever is less. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-12.14(2)(a). Exception to Immediate Successor Status Under Iowa law, immediate successors have a duty to withhold a portion of the purchase price to pay outstanding sales tax, interest, and penalties owed by the business that is being purchased. Persons who take ownership of the business by operation of law, rather than for consideration, are not obligated to either withhold a portion of any applicable purchase price or investigate unpaid sales tax liabilities. This could include, for example:• a person foreclosing on a valid security interest; • a person retaking possession of premises under a valid lease; • a spouse electing to take under a will; • a person taking by gift; or • any other person taking for what would legally be considered “for value” but without the payment of a recognizable “purchase price.” Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-12.14(1) Good Faith Exception to Successor Liability Iowa has implemented several exceptions to the general rule providing for successor liability for unpaid sales or use taxes. The immediate successor to a retailer's business is not personally liable for the amount of unpaid tax, interest, or penalty due, if the immediate successor shows that the purchase of the business or stock of goods was made in good faith with the understanding that no delinquent tax, interest, or penalty was due and unpaid. A purchaser of a retail business shows good faith when one of the following situations exists: • the Department of Revenue, upon request, has provided the immediate successor with a certified statement (but not oral statements) that no delinquent tax, interest, or penalty is unpaid; or • the immediate successor has taken “in good faith” a certified statement, taken under oath before a notary or other public official authorized to take oaths, from the previous business owners that no delinquent tax, interest, or penalty is unpaid as of the date of purchase and the purchaser has exercised due diligence, and has no reason to believe a retailer's statement was false. Iowa Code Ann. §421.28; Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-12.14(4). BNA-SUTN IA 31.3.3.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Certified Service Providers

Relieves Liability Under Iowa law a model 1 seller's obligation to calculate, collect, and remit sales and use taxes shall be performed by its certified service provider. Iowa Code Ann. §423.48(3). The certified service provider is not responsible for the seller's obligation to remit tax on its own purchases. Iowa Code Ann. §423.48(3). Iowa defines “certified service provider” as agent certified under the agreement to perform all of a seller's sales or use tax functions, other than the seller's obligation to remit tax on its own purchases. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-211.1. Iowa defines “model 1 seller” as a seller that has selected a certified service provider as its agent to perform all the seller's sales and use tax functions, other than the seller's obligation to remit tax on its own purchases.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Forms and Returns

Provided Individuals and businesses that are required to collect and remit sales and use tax must file return forms with the taxes when they are paid to the Iowa Department of Revenue. Iowa Code Ann. §423.31(1). Also, a purchaser of items subject to sales tax must file a use tax return if they otherwise do not pay the sales tax to a retailer that is required to collect the tax. Iowa Code Ann. §423.32. The returns must be signed by the person filing the return, or by that person's duly authorized agent, when the tax returns are filed. Iowa Code Ann. §423.31(1). Sales and use tax returns are filed electronically. In addition to sales and use tax returns, responsible parties may be required to submit returns relating to local option taxes that are administered by the Iowa Department of Revenue. Iowa Code Ann. §423B.6(2)(b). Retailers that collect more than $50 in tax during any one month are required to make a monthly deposit with the Department. For retailers collecting between $50 and $500 per month, the deposit will be the actual amount collected or 30 percent of the amount collected in the preceding . Retailers that collect more than $500 a month are required to deposit the actual amount of tax collected. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-12.1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Due Date Filing

Varies Iowa requires most taxpayers to file sales and use tax returns on a monthly basis. Due dates vary based on how often taxpayers are required to file. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-12.1; see Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-12.13(2);Iowa Dept. of Rev., Filing Frequencies and Return Due Dates - Iowa Sales Tax Filing Statuses. Some taxpayers may be required to file on a semi-monthly, quarterly or annual basis, depending on the seller's average annual sales and use tax liability. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-12.13(2). Local option taxes are not included in the computation of the average annual tax liability used to determine filing frequency. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-107.4(2), as amended by 41 Iowa Admin. Bull. No. 18 (Feb. 27, 2019), effective April 3, 2019. Annual Filing Annual filing is available to retail taxpayers with an average sales and use tax liability equal to or less than $120 per year during the previous 12 months, not including local sales and use taxes administered by the Iowa Department of Revenue. The annual sales tax return is due no later than January 31st of the year following the year in which taxes were due. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-12.1. Quarterly Filing Quarterly filing is available to retail taxpayers with an average sales and use tax liability equal to more than $120 but less than $6,000 per year, not including local sales and use taxes administered by the Iowa Department of Revenue.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Voluntary Disclosure Relief

Yes Iowa has a voluntary disclosure program designed to encourage unregistered business entities and persons to voluntarily contact the department regarding unreported Iowa sales and use tax collections. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-3.1. Any person located outside of Iowa who is subject to Iowa tax or tax collection responsibilities may be eligible for Iowa's voluntary disclosure program. The Department may initially be contacted on an anonymous basis and anonymity can be maintained pending execution of the voluntary disclosure agreement. The voluntary disclosure program must be used to ensure future compliance by taxpayers. In ensuring future compliance, the voluntary disclosure program can also be used to report previous periods of Iowa source income and to settle outstanding tax, penalty, and interest liabilities. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-3.1. Only taxes, penalties and interest related to Iowa source income are eligible for settlement under the voluntary disclosure program. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-3.1(1). The Department has discretion to determine who is eligible for participation in the voluntary disclosure program. In making the determination, the Department may consider the following factors: • the location of the person must be outside of Iowa; • the person must be subject to Iowa tax on Iowa source income or have Iowa tax collection responsibilities; • the person must not currently be under audit or examination by the Department or under criminal investigation by the Department; • the person must not have had prior contact with the Department or a representative of the Department that could lead to audit or assessment associated with the tax types or tax periods sought to be addressed under the voluntary disclosure program; • the type and extent of activities resulting in Iowa source income; • failure to report the Iowa source income or pay any liability was not due to fraud, intentional misrepresentation, an intent to evade tax, or willful disregard of Iowa tax laws; and • any other factors relevant to the particular situation. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-3.1(2). Application to Participate in the Voluntary Disclosure Program To apply for the voluntary disclosure program, the person must submit a written application to the Iowa Department of Revenue. The application must include the following:• the types of taxes involved; • separate statements evidencing compliance with each of the eligibility requirements; • a complete and accurate description of the person's activities resulting in Iowa source income, the source of the Iowa source income or Iowa tax collection responsibilities, the type and dates of the activities in Iowa, a description of the product or service sold in Iowa, and the number of activity occurrences in Iowa per year or whether the activities in Iowa per year were continuous; • the reason for noncompliance with Iowa tax law; • an estimation of the amount of unpaid Iowa tax by tax type and applicable tax periods; and • any other matters relevant to the particular situation. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-3.1(3). The Department reserves the right to request additional information that the Department determines is necessary to determine or approximate the liability due, and to determine the applicant's eligibility, the accuracy of information presented and statements asserted by the applicant, and the terms of the voluntary disclosure agreement. Rejection of an application prior to the execution of an agreement may be based on the following: • the applicant's ineligibility; • the applicant's noncompliance in submitting information, documents, evidence, or returns within the time period as requested by the Department;misrepresentation of a material fact by the applicant; or • the Department's determination that the matter may be best handled by using other means of administration. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-3.1(4). Terms of the Voluntary Disclosure Agreement The Department has the discretion to settle all outstanding Iowa source income tax, penalty, and interest liabilities of an eligible applicant. Settlement terms are on a case-by-case basis. The existence of the voluntary disclosure agreement and the terms of the agreement are to be held confidential by all parties to the agreement. Items considered by the department in determining the settlement terms include: • the type of tax; the tax periods at issue; • the reason for noncompliance; • whether the tax is a trust fund tax; • the types of activities resulting in the Iowa source income; • the frequency of the activities that resulted in the Iowa source income;and • any other matters relevant to the particular situation. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-3.1(5). All voluntary disclosure agreements must require that the applicant file future Iowa tax returns, unless the activity by the applicant resulting in the Iowa source income has changed or there has been a change in the law, rules, or court cases that dictate a different result. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-3.1(5). Commencement of the Voluntary Disclosure Agreement Prior to the execution of the voluntary disclosure agreement by the taxpayer and the Department's authorized personnel, the taxpayer is not protected from the Department's regular audit process if the identity of the taxpayer, as an applicant, is unknown to the department. However, if the Department has knowledge of the taxpayer's identity, as an applicant, the Department will not take audit action against the taxpayer during the voluntary disclosure process. If a voluntary disclosure agreement is not reached, the Department may assess tax, penalty, and interest as provided by law at the time the identity of the applicant becomes known to the Department. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-3.1(6). Voiding a Voluntary Disclosure Agreement The Department also has the authority to declare a voluntary disclosure agreement null and void subsequent to the execution of the agreement. The Department may void the contractual agreement if the Department determines that a misrepresentation of a material fact was made by the person to the Department. The Department may also void a voluntary disclosure agreement if the Department determines any of the following has occurred: • The person does not submit information requested by the department within the time period specified by the Department, including any extensions granted by the Department. • The person fails to file future Iowa returns as agreed to in the voluntary disclosure agreement. • The person does not pay the agreed settlement liability within the time period designated by the Department, including any extensions of time that may be granted by the Department. • The person does not remit all taxes imposed upon or collected by the person for all subsequent tax periods and all tax types that are subject to the voluntary disclosure agreement. • The person fails to prospectively comply with Iowa tax law. Whether the person has failed to prospectively comply with Iowa tax law is determined by the Department on a case-by-case basis. • The person, based on a determination by the Department, materially understates the person's tax liability; or • The person has made a material breach of the terms of the voluntary disclosure agreement. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-3.1(7). Transfer or Assignment The terms of the voluntary disclosure agreement are valid and enforceable by and against all parties, including transferees and assignees. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-3.1(9). Confidentiality The terms of each voluntary disclosure contract are determined on a case-by-case basis. Except as may be specifically required by law or preexisting written agreement, the existence of a voluntary disclosure agreement and the terms of the voluntary disclosure agreement are to be held confidential by the parties to the voluntary disclosure agreement, their representatives, transferees, and assignees. Disclosure of the existence of a voluntary disclosure agreement or the terms of such an agreement in a manner contrary to this rule may result in the agreement being declared null and void at the discretion of the nondisclosing party.

Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-11.2; Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-11.5. Failure to File a Return The Department of Revenue is permitted to calculate the amount of tax due when a taxpayer fails to file a return or fails to correct a return after receiving notice from the Department. The Department's determination can be made based on factors such as the taxpayer's number of employees, rentals paid, and stock on hand. Iowa Code Ann. §423.37(2).
