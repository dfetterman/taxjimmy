Depends In Arizona, tangible personal property and services that are transferred together for a single, non-segregated price, are subject to transaction privilege tax on the entire amount charged, if the property is a consequential element of the transaction. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5061(F), as renumbered by 2015 Ariz. S.B. 1216 effective April 9, 2015; Ariz. Admin. Code 15-5-105. Where tangible personal property is furnished by a service provider only as an “inconsequential element” of the rendering of a nontaxable service, the gross receipts of the service provider allocable to the tangible personal property are not subject to tax. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5061(A)(1); Ariz. Admin. Code 15-5-104(B); Val-Pak E. Valley, Inc. v. Arizona Dept. of Rev., 272 P.3d 1055 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2012). Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property to a person engaged in a professional or personal service occupation or business are subject to tax if the tangible personal property is used or consumed in the performance of the service or is sold only as an inconsequential element of the nontaxable service provided. Ariz. Admin. Code 15-5-104(A). Tangible personal property constitutes an “inconsequential element” of a nontaxable service if the following criteria are met: Ariz. Admin. Code 15-5-104; Val-Pak E. Valley, Inc. v. Arizona Dept. of Rev., 272 P.3d 1055 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2012). • the amount paid by the service provider for the tangible personal property equals less than 15 percent of the amount charged by the service provider for the service purchased; • the tangible personal property transferred by the service provider is not in a form that is subject to retail sale; and • no charge for the tangible personal property is separately stated on the invoice issued by the service provider.

Taxable Unlike the case under most state sales tax laws, Arizona's transaction privilege tax is not imposed separately on individual retail transactions. Instead, a retailer is liable for tax on the gross proceeds from the retailer's taxable sales of tangible personal property. All of a retailer's gross proceeds from sales of tangible personal property are presumed to derive from taxable sales and the burden is on the retailer to establish otherwise. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5023. Thus, where a retailer makes both taxable and nontaxable sales of personal property, whether in bundled or separate sales transactions, all gross proceeds that the retailer cannot establish were derived from nontaxable sales are subject to tax. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5023. Bundled Telecommunications Services Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5064(D) states that a telecommunications service provider who can reasonably identify the portion of the sales price of the bundled transaction derived from charges for nontaxable services will be subject to tax under the telecommunications classification only on the gross proceeds of sales or gross income derived from the taxable services. Under this section, a telecommunications service provider can elect to reasonably identify the portion of the sales price of the bundled transaction derived from charges for nontaxable services by using allocation percentages derived from the telecommunications service provider's entire service area, including territories outside of this state. In addition, the section allows the department to require the telecommunications service provider to actually provide this allocation information. The reasonableness of the allocation will be subject to audit by the department. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5064(D). BNA-SUTN AZ 9.3.2.

Differs from State While county taxes apply to the same items subject to the state's transaction privilege tax, municipal transaction privilege taxes do not always conform to the state treatment of an item. See, e.g., Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6103(A); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6111(A); Ariz. Const. Art. 13 §2; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §9-284. Counties County taxes imposed as a percentage of the state transaction privilege tax apply to the same items that are taxable at the state level. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6103(A); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6106(B)(1); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6107(A)(1); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6109(A); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6111(A). Municipalities In General In addition to county taxes, cities with a population of 3,500 or more people are authorized to adopt a charter and impose taxes within the limits of the charter, the Arizona Constitution, and the general laws not specifically relating to cities. Ariz. Const. Art. 13 §2; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §9-284. Thus, local municipalities may levy a transaction privilege tax that is similar to the Arizona state transaction privilege tax. However, it should be noted that there are differences between the state and municipally imposed transaction privilege taxes. Often the taxable transactions and exemptions vary between municipalities and do not correspond to the state tax base. For example, the state does not impose a transaction privilege tax on renting or leasing residential real property or the sale of advertising. However, many cities impose tax on these types of transactions. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5010(A); Arizona Transaction Privilege and Other Tax Rate Tables—May 2019; Arizona Dept. of Rev., Transaction Privilege Tax (TPT)/Licensing; Arizona Publication No. 645; Arizona Private Taxpayer Ruling LR16-007. Additionally, at least one municipality exempts transfers of renewable energy credits, gross proceeds of sales attributable to the transfer of electricity to an electric distributions system by a retail electric customer owning a solar photovoltaic energy generating system, and gross income derived from sales of electricity or natural gas to a business principally engaged in manufacturing or smelting operations. Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Changes &News March 2017. Cities and towns may not levy transaction privilege, sales, use or similar taxes on the following:• the exhibition of events conducted or operated by a nonprofit or tax-exempt organization, if the organization is associated with a major league baseball team or a national touring professional golfing association and no part of the organization's net earnings inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual; • interstate telecommunications services, which include that portion of telecommunications services, such as subscriber line service, allocable by federal law to interstate telecommunications service; • sales of warranty or service contracts; • sales of motor vehicles to nonresidents of this state for use outside this state if the vendor ships or delivers the motor vehicle to a destination outside this state; • interest on finance contracts; • dealer documentation fees on the sale of motor vehicles; • sales of food or other items purchased with U.S. Department of Agriculture food stamp coupons issued under the Food Stamp Act of 1977, but may impose such a tax on other sales of food.

A controlling interest is defined as direct or indirect ownership of at least 80 percent of voting shares; • the consumption or use of natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas used to propel a motor vehicle; • a motor carrier's use on the public highways in this state if the motor carrier is already subject to fees in title 28, chapter 16, article 4 of the Arizona Revised Statute Annotated; • leasing, renting or licensing a motor vehicle subject to and upon which the fee has been paid under title 28, chapter 16, article 4 of the Arizona Revised Statute Annotated; • the sale of a motor vehicle and any repair and replacement parts and tangible personal property becoming a part of such motor vehicle to a motor carrier who is subject to a fee prescribed in title 28, chapter 16, article 4 and who is engaged in the business of leasing, renting or licensing such property; • incarcerating or detaining in a privately operated prison, jail or detention facility prisoners who are under the jurisdiction of the United States, this state or any other state or a political subdivision of this state or of any other state; • transporting for hire persons, freight or property by light motor vehicles subject to a fee under title 28, chapter 15, article 4; • any amount attributable to development fees that are incurred in relation to the construction, development or improvement of real property and paid by the taxpayer as defined in the Model City Tax Code or by a contractor providing services to the taxpayer; • entire product mined, smelted, extracted, refined, produced or prepared for sale, profit or commercial use, on persons engaged in the business of mineral processing, except to the extent that the tax is computed on the gross proceeds or gross income from sales at retail; • a manufacturer's cash rebate on the sales price of a motor vehicle if the buyer assigns the buyer's right in the rebate to the retailer; • a waste tire disposal fee; or • the storage, use or consumption of tangible personal property in the city or town by a school district or charter school. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6004, as amended by 2011 Ariz. S.B. 1166, effective July 20, 2011; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6015(B)(3), as added by 2018 Ariz. H.B. 2484, effective June 19, 2018; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6015(B)(4), as added by 2018 Ariz. H.B. 2484, effective June 19, 2018. Effective June 19, 2018, if a city, town, or other taxing jurisdiction imposes a transaction privilege, sales, use, franchise, or other similar tax or fee on the sale of food items intended for human consumption at home, the tax must be applied uniformly with respect to all food items. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6015(A)(1), as added by 2018 Ariz. H.B. 2484, effective June 19, 2018. Also effective June 19, 2018, if a city, town, or other taxing jurisdiction imposes a transaction privilege, sales, use, franchise, or other similar tax or fee on the sale of food items intended for human consumption on the premises, the tax must be applied uniformly with respect to all food items. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6015(A)(2), as added by 2018 Ariz. H.B. 2484, effective June 19, 2018. Effective June 19, 2018, cities, towns, and other taxing jurisdictions are prohibited from levying a transaction privilege, sales, use, franchise, or other similar tax or fee with respect to:• the manufacture, wholesale, or distribution to or among any wholesalers, distributors, or retailers, of food items intended for human consumption at home or on the premises; Ariz.

Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6015(B)(2), as added by 2018 Ariz. H.B. 2484, effective June 19, 2018. In an attempt to promote uniformity amongst municipalities in the imposition of local transaction privilege taxes, the Arizona Department of Revenue promulgates the Model City Tax Code(“MCTC”). Arizona Dept. of Rev., Model City Tax Code, Introduction. The MCTC provides uniform definitions and categories of potentially taxable transactions, while allowing cities options about which transactions to tax. Cities are authorized to adopt all or portions of the MCTC when enacting a local transaction privilege tax. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6053; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6054. All city and town privilege taxes are subject to local voter approval. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6006. Any changes to the MCTC that are not reflected in the official copy on file with the department are void and have no effect. Further, the failure of a city or town to notify the department of a new or different tax rate renders the new or different tax rate void and without effect. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6053, as amended by 2014 Ariz. S.B. 1331, effective retroactively to July 1, 1988 (any claim for refund of transaction privilege tax paid based on the retroactive application of this amendment must be submitted to the department or the appropriate city on or before Dec. 31, 2014).
