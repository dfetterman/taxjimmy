Taxable The application of sales or use tax to labor or service charges billed to customers with sales of tangible personal property and repairs to tangible personal property is specifically addressed by Alabama statutes and a regulation. Ala. Code §40-23-1(a)(6); Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.84. Labor or service charges are taxable, whether included in the total charge for the product or billed as a separate item, if the labor or service:• is incidental to making, producing, or fabricating a new or different item of tangible personal property or otherwise preparing the tangible personal property for sale; and • is performed prior to transfer of title to the purchaser. Ala. Code §40-23-1(a)(6); Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.84; Alabama Administrative Law Judge Ruling Docket No. S. 96-323 (Feb. 21, 1997). Labor or service charges are not taxable when billed for labor or services expended in repairing or altering existing tangible personal property to restore the property to its original condition without producing new parts. Ala. Code §40-23-1(a)(6); Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.84. However, a taxpayer must keep books and records which document what services are performed post-sale as opposed to pre-sale; otherwise all service charges could be subject to sales tax. Alabama Administrative Law Judge Ruling Docket No. S. 16-310-CE (Jan. 14, 2019). The Court of Civil Appeals of Alabama held in Alabama v. Harrison, Alabama v. Harrison, 386 So. 2d 460 (Ala. Ct. App. 1980). that the transfer of property by a business that sold its time, talent, and advice was incidental to the transaction. In this decision, a public relations firm provided services, such as filming motion pictures, photography, making tapes for a television or radio show, and preparing catalogues and brochures. With respect to the sale of catalogues, the taxpayer also arranged for them to be printed, and thereafter charged its client for the printing and services. The issue was whether the transaction was a sale of tangible personal property for sales tax purposes. The court found persuasive the fact that the brochures would have no value to anyone but the purchasers. The court likened the facts to those of a dentist fitting a patient with dentures. In both situations, the transaction is the culmination of and could not be separated from the services. As such, the transaction was held not subject to sales tax. In Alabama v. Central Computer Services, Inc., the Supreme Court of Alabama held that eight computer programs constituted intangible personal property. Alabama v. Central Computer Services, Inc., 349 So. 2d 1160 (Ala. 1977). In Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Mobile, Alabama, 696 So. 2d 290 (Ala. 1996), the Alabama Supreme Court overruled Alabama v. Central Computer Services, Inc. and held that canned computer software is tangible property for purposes of sales and use tax. The court quoted South Cent. Bell Tel. Co. v. Barthelemy, 643 So. 2d 1240 (La. 1994 for the proposition that, “[t]he software itself, i.e., the physical copy, is not merely a right or an idea to be comprehended by the understanding. The purchaser of the computer software neither desires nor receives mere knowledge, but rather receives a certain arrangement of matter that will make his or her computer perform a desired function. This arrangement of matter, physically recorded on some tangible medium, constitutes a corporeal body.” The essence of the transaction was the purchase of non–taxable intangible information the court stated. The commingling of the physical with the information was held to be incidental. The court distinguished its ruling in Boswell v. Paramount Television Sales, Inc. Boswell v. Paramount Television Sales, Inc., 282 So. 2d 892 (Ala. 1973). In Paramount the court held that leases of films and tapes were subject to tax because the right to publish or broadcast the picture was physically inseparable from the film itself. The Central Computer Services court reasoned that the software could have been sent over telephone lines or in the mind of a vendor's employee, while the movies could not have been delivered electronically. Based on this distinction, the court held that the software was intangible and not subject to use tax. The court quoted approvingly from other jurisdictions holding likewise that the software is unlike movies in that once transferred, the software is without value, and also that the software is not ready to be used at the time of purchase. The dissent noted that movies could be transmitted into the state via an intangible medium, so Paramount is not altogether distinguishable. Boswell v. Paramount Television Sales, Inc., 282 So. 2d 892 (Ala. 1973). BNA-SUTN AL 9.3.1.

No Guidance Alabama does not have a regulation or statute determining whether a transaction is a bundled transaction when two distinct and identifiable items are sold for one non-itemized price. Alabama Administrative Law Judge Ruling Docket No. S. 03-1161 (Oct. 7, 2004). However, presumably, such bundles would be tainted by the taxable item and taxed in their entirety. For taxpayers to claim exemptions, the components of a transaction should be separately stated on an invoice. Alabama Revenue Ruling 94-002 (Oct. 5, 1994). BNA-SUTN AL 9.3.2.

Differs from State Sales and use taxes imposed by municipalities in Alabama may differ from the state sales tax in four ways: rate, participation in sales tax holidays, ability to tax sales by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, and the application of voluntary disclosure rules. Ala. Code §11-51-200; Ala. Code §11-51-201(a); Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-3-.65. Otherwise, local sales and use tax in Alabama must parallel the state sales and use tax and conform to the state taxing authority's definitions, exceptions, exemptions, proceedings, requirements, provisions, rules, and regulations promulgated under the Alabama Administrative Procedure Act. Ala. Code §11-51-201(a). Local Sales and Use Tax Rates Local sales and use tax rates may vary from the state rates. Local rates vary from 0.5 percent to 5 percent. Alabama Dept. of Rev., Local Tax Notices. The local sales and use tax rates range from 0.5 percent to 5 percent. Alabama Dept. of Rev., Local Tax Notices. Municipalities may also determine, by ordinance, the rate of sales and use tax within that range. Ala. Code §11-51-205(a). Local Sales and Use Tax Holidays Alabama provides for a sales tax holiday, which begins at 12:01 a.m. the first Friday in August, and extends until twelve midnight the following Sunday. During this time, no state sales or use tax is due on “covered items” as defined in Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-3-.65(1). Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-3-.65(1). A severe weather preparedness sales tax holiday begins at 12:01 a.m. on the Friday of the last full weekend in February and ends at twelve midnight the following Sunday. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-3-.66. Similarly, counties and municipalities may participate in the sales tax holidays by adopting appropriate resolutions or ordinances 30 days prior to the beginning of the holiday. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-3-.65(2); Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-3-.66(2). Local municipalities are prohibited from providing a sales and use tax exemption during any period other than concurrently with a state sales tax holiday. Ala. Code §40-23-213; Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-3-.65(2); Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-3-.66(2). Some localities have adopted the sales tax holiday on a limited basis, and only a portion of the sales and use tax is forgiven. Alabama Dept. of Rev., Local Governments That Have Notified the Department Regarding Participation. For a complete determination on how the sales tax holiday applies to the local taxes, contact the local jurisdiction. Alabama Dept. of Rev., Local Governments That Have Notified the Department Regarding Participation. For more information about sales tax holidays in Alabama, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Alabama 7.14. Local Sales and Use Tax on Alcoholic Beverages Municipalities may not impose taxes on the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board of the State of Alabama for the sale of alcoholic beverages. Ala. Code §11-51-200. Local Sales and Use Tax Voluntary Disclosure Alabama offers a voluntary disclosure program for state sales and use tax liability. Alabama Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program Guidelines. The application of the voluntary disclosure program to local sales and use taxes depends on whether the state administers the local sales and use taxes. If a county is state-administered, then the rules applying to the state voluntary disclosure program apply. If the local county sales and use tax is not state-administered, then the application of the voluntary disclosure program, if the county elects to have one, depends on the county in question. If a county that administers its own sales and use tax elects to provide a voluntary disclosure program, then the county may determine how to administer such a program. Alabama Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program Guidelines; phone call with Brenda Taylor at the Alabama Dept. of Rev., 334-353-9577 (Nov. 2010). For a complete determination on whether a locality offers a voluntary disclosure program and how it is administered, contact the local jurisdiction. BNA-SUTN AL 9.4.
