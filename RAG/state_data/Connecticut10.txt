Refundable A business purchaser in Connecticut may claim a sales tax refund if it purchases tangible personal property from a retailer for use or consumption in carrying on its business solely outside Connecticut. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-408c(a)(A); Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-408c(a)(B). More specifically, this applies when the purchase is made for the purpose of subsequently transporting the property outside of Connecticut by common or contract carrier for use or consumption thereafter solely outside Connecticut, or for the purpose of being processed, fabricated, or manufactured into other tangible personal property to be transported outside Connecticut by common or contract carrier, and thereafter used or consumed solely outside Connecticut. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-408c(a)(A); Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-408c(a)(B). Under the state's “Buy Connecticut”provision, the Commissioner, at his discretion, may issue permits allowing taxpayers to purchase tangible personal property from Connecticut retailers exempt from sales and use taxes, where the property is eventually shipped out of Connecticut for exclusive use by the purchaser outside Connecticut. The DRS has determined that tangible personal property purchased with an exemption permit may be stored in Connecticut for up to three years from the date it is purchased. The business must own the property at the time it is transported outside Connecticut, and must use the property exclusively outside of Connecticut after it is transported, for as long as it owns the property. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-4308c(b)(2); Connecticut Special Notice SN 2001(5) (Sept. 28, 2001). BNA-SUTN CT 4.3.3.
