Oklahoma also imposes sales tax on enumerated services. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, §1354(A). All gross receipts are presumed taxable unless the vendor establishes that a sale of tangible personal property or enumerated services is exempt.

Okla. Const. art. V, § 33. Timing Oklahoma requires retailers or vendors located in Oklahoma to collect taxes from the consumer or user at the time of sale. A retailer or vendor must collect the use tax from the purchaser if the retailer or vendor maintains places of business within Oklahoma and also outside Oklahoma, and makes taxable sales from outside Oklahoma for use in Oklahoma.

Yes Oklahoma imposes a state use tax on the purchase price of tangible personal property acquired outside Oklahoma that is stored, used, or otherwise consumed within Oklahoma. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, §1402; Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, §1354(A). The user or consumer must pay the use tax directly to the Oklahoma Tax Commission if the use tax was not paid previously to the vendor. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, §1405; Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-21-3; Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-21-4. Use tax does not apply if sales tax has already been collected in Oklahoma. Okla. Stat.

Thus, if a taxpayer moves depreciated property into Oklahoma, the taxpayer must pay use tax on the full purchase price, not the current depreciated value. See Oklahoma Letter Ruling LR-14-063 (June 24, 2015). BNA-SUTN OK 1.1.2.

If a local, county, or municipal sales tax has been previously paid on the goods or services, the amount paid may be deducted from the use tax owed. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, §1411. The county or municipal use tax will not apply when tangible personal property is intended solely for use outside the county or municipality, even if the tangible personal property is stored in the county or municipality pending shipment outside the county or municipality or is temporarily retained in the county or municipality for fabrication, repair, testing, alteration, maintenance, or other service. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, §1411. Any local, county, or municipal sales tax previously paid on goods or services may be deducted from the amounts that may be due for a county or municipal use tax.

Ann. tit. 68, §1411. The complete list of county and city rates, effective October through December 2018, can be found here: Oklahoma Rates and Codes for Sales, Use and Lodging Tax - 4th Quarter.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Sale' and 'Retail Sale'

Defined Oklahoma defines “sale” as the transfer of title or possession of tangible personal property for a valuable consideration. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, §1352(22); Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-1-2. If title does not pass, then the transaction is not a “sale,” and therefore, is not subject to sales and use tax. For example, an automobile's title does not pass from a car rental company to the car rental customer when the customer or her insurance company reimburses the rental company for collision damage, even if the reimbursement is for the vehicle's full value. Therefore, the reimbursement payment is not a sale, and therefore, is not subject to sales and use tax. See Oklahoma Letter Ruling LR-14-006 (Feb. 23, 2015). “Sale” includes:• the exchange, barter, lease, or rental of tangible personal property resulting in the transfer of title to or possession of the property; Okla.
