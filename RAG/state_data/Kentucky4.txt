Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Motor Vehicles, Intrastate or Non-Commercial Use Purchase, Lease, or Rental Transactions

Depends Sales tax does not apply if the sale is to a Kentucky resident, the motor vehicle is registered for use on the public highways, and the appropriate Motor Vehicle Usage Tax, or U-Drive-It Tax, has been paid. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §139.470(19)(a). Motor vehicles are generally subject to Motor Vehicle Usage Tax upon registration. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §138.460; Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §138.463; Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §138.470. Motor vehicles are defined to include any vehicle that is propelled by anything other than muscular power and that is used for transportation of persons or property over the public highways of Kentucky. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §138.450(5). Sales tax does apply, however, to vehicles sold to Kentucky residents and registered for non-highway use. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §138.460; Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §138.463; Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §138.470. Sales tax also does not apply to the sale of semi-trailers and trailers intended for the carrying of freight or merchandise and having a load capacity of over one thousand (1,000)pounds. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §139.470(20); Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §189.010(12); Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §189.010(17). Sales tax is also inapplicable if the sale is to a nonresident of Kentucky and the motor vehicle is registered in a state that either allows Kentucky residents to purchase motor vehicles without payment of the state sales and use tax upon sale or allows Kentucky residents to remove the vehicle from that state within a specified period of time for subsequent registration and use in Kentucky without paying that state's sales and use tax. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §139.470(19)(b). U-Drive-It U-Drive-It (UDI) is an alternative method for the payment of Motor Vehicle Usage Tax, and is available to individuals or businesses that offer motor vehicles for rental or lease. If the party registering the motor vehicle possesses a UDI permit, payment of the tax normally due at the point of registration may be deferred, and instead paid on future receipts generated by the rental or lease of the vehicle. The party registering the vehicle is directly responsible for UDI, but the amount of tax due may be passed on to the party renting or leasing the vehicle. 103 Ky. Admin. Regs. 28:051(7)(2); Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §138.463; Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §139.200(1); Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. §139.200(2). Horse Trailers Horse trailers weighing over 1,000 lbs., including those that contain living quarters, are not subject to sales and use tax. Horse trailers fit into the definition of exempt semitrailers as they are intended for carrying freight and merchandise. The Kentucky Court of Appeals has held that the transportation of horses is within the meaning of “carriage of freight.”No distinction is made for horse trailers used for recreational purposes and those used to take horses to sale. See Kentucky Dept. of Rev. v. Shinin' B Trailer Sales, LLC, No. 2014-CA-001097-MR, 2015 BL 287689 (Ky. Ct. App. 2015); see also Kentucky Board of Tax Appeals Order No. K-23042 (May 9, 2013).
