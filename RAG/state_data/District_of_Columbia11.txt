Rates;Economic Nexus; Federal Buildings The District of Columbia has a unique system of passing legislation due to the fact that it is not one of the 50 states. In the District of Columbia, after an act has been passed by the Washington, D.C. Council (the “Council”) it must be sent to the United States House of Representatives and Senate for a period of 30 days before becoming effective as law. 5 U.S.C. § 801; D.C. Code § 1-206.01. The United States Congress may enact into law a joint resolution disapproving the Council's Act which, if approved by the President of the United States within the 30 day period, prevents the Council's Act from becoming law. If no joint resolution has been approved by the President of the United States within the 30 day review period, the Council's Act becomes a law. 5 U.S.C. § 801; D.C. Code § 1-206.01. Because of the long and time-consuming path a bill must take to become law under the District's Charter, Congress has provided a mechanism whereby the Council may enact legislation quickly, on a short term basis. The District's Charter allows the Council to enact special “emergency” legislation without the need for a second reading and without the need for 30 days of congressional review. Mayoral review is still required. The District frequently uses this emergency authority to pass or extend tax legislation. 5 U.S.C. § 801; D.C. Code § 1-206.01. Sales and Use Tax Rate Increase Effective Oct. 1, 2018, the District of Columbia applies a district-wide general sales and use tax rate of 6 percent, with exceptions for certain specially enumerated items and services. D.C. Code Ann. § 47-2002(a), as amended by 2018 D.C. B. 753, effective Oct. 1, 2018; D.C. Code Ann. § 47-2202, as amended by 2018 D.C. B. 753, effective Oct. 1, 2018; District of Columbia Tax Rates Changes Take Effect Monday, Oct. 1 (Sept. 5, 2018). The revenue raised by this increase will be used as a dedicated funding source for public transportation. The tax rate was also increased for transient accommodations, rental vehicles, and alcohol sold for consumption off the premises where sold. See 2018 D.C. B. 753, effective Oct. 1, 2018. This rate increase was initially passed via emergency legislation, which expired Sept. 30, 2018. 2018 D.C. B. 901, effective July 30, 2018, and expiring Oct. 1, 2018. For more information about current sales and use tax rates, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at District of Columbia 5.2.10. Economic Nexus The District of Columbia council has proposed legislation to create an economic nexus standard. The bill, B22-0914, seeks to establish an economic nexus standard for D.C., requiring remote sellers who reach $100,000 in sales or 200 transactions into the district to collect sales tax. 65 D.C. Register, No. 38, p. 9715 (Sept. 21, 2018). A public hearing on the bill is set for Oct. 10, 2018. 65 D.C. Register, No. 38, p. 9715 (Sept. 21, 2018). For information about current nexus standards, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at District of Columbia 3.1.2.1.

Act 18-0657, approved Dec. 17, 2010, effective after a 30-day Congressional review period. Sales of goods and services made by government-sponsored enterprises including, but not limited to, the Smithsonian Institution, National Gallery of Art, National Building Museum, Federal National Mortgage Association, and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation are taxable if the federal enterprise or organization is otherwise exempt from such taxation, to the extent such sales would otherwise be subject to the sales and use taxes of the District of Columbia if the federal enterprise or organization were organized as a nonprofit corporation established pursuant to the District of Columbia Nonprofit Corporation Act, and was exempt from federal income taxation pursuant to I.R.C. §501(c)(3). 2010 D.C. Act 18-0657, approved Dec. 17, 2010, effective after a 30-day Congressional review period; D.C. Code § 47-2002.01, as amended by 2012 D.C. Act 19-355, effective July 13, 2012. BNA-SUTN DC 1.3.
