Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Taxation of Property

Taxable Louisiana levies tax on the retail sale of tangible personal property within the state or on the use, consumption, distribution, storage for use or consumption, lease, or rental of tangible personal property within Louisiana. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:302; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:321; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:331. Notwithstanding the use of the common law term “tangible personal property,” for sales and use tax purposes, the classification of tangible personal property is determined under the Louisiana civil law as embodied in the Civil Code. Under the tax law, the term “tangible personal property” has the same meaning as “corporeal movable property”under the Civil Code. Louisiana Private Letter Ruling 06-010 (July 24, 2006); New Orleans, La. v. Baumer Foods, Inc., 532 So. 2d 1381 (La. 1988).

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Taxation of Services

Depends Louisiana does not impose sales and use tax on a service unless that service is specifically enumerated as taxable. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(14). Louisiana imposes tax on the following enumerated services:• furnishing sleeping rooms, cottages, or cabins by hotels; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(14)(a). • sales of admissions to places of amusement, to athletic entertainment (other than that of schools, colleges, and universities) and recreational events, and charges for dues or fees for access to clubs or for the use of amusement, entertainment, athletic, or recreational facilities; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(14)(b). • furnishing of storage or parking privileges by auto hotels and parking lots; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(14)(c). • furnishing of printing or overprinting, lithographic, multilith, blue printing, photostating or other similar services of reproducing written or graphic matter; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(14)(d). • furnishing of laundry, cleaning, pressing and dyeing services, including cleaning and renovation of clothing, furs, furniture, carpets, and rugs, and the furnishing of storage space for clothing, furs, and rugs. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(14)(e). • furnishing of cold storage space, except under a bailment arrangement, and the furnishing of the service of preparing tangible personal property for cold storage where such service is incidental to the operation of storage facilities; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(14)(f). • furnishing of repairs to tangible personal property, including the repair and servicing of automobiles and other vehicles, electrical and mechanical appliances and equipment, watches, jewelry, refrigerators, radios, shoes, and office appliances and equipment; and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(14)(g). • furnishing of telecommunications services for compensation, but only for state sales and use tax purposes. Localities may not impose sales and use tax on telecommunications services if the local tax was not in effect on July 1, 1990. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(14)(i). A regulation explains that Louisiana law treats taxable services the same as the sale of merchandise. In a transaction involving a taxable service or property, if an exempt service is not specifically identified and segregated in billings to customers, the exempt service provider's entire charge is subject to tax. La. Admin. Code tit. 61, § 4301(Sales of Services)(a). With the limited exception of telecommunications services, the same services subject to tax at the state level are also subject to local sales and use taxes. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 47:338.25; La. Admin. Code tit. 61, § 4301(Sales of Services)(a); see also La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §337.11.1, as enacted by 2008 La. H.B. 383, effective June 30, 2008 (providing that a pharmacy or pharmacist must collect any sales and use tax levied by a local political subdivision in Louisiana and must remit tax on the sale of prescription drugs and pharmacist services).

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

True Object Test If a transaction involves a mix of taxable and nontaxable components, then Louisiana applies the “true object test” to determine the sales and use tax treatment of the transaction. Louisiana Administrative Revenue Ruling 02-012 (Aug. 30, 2002). Under that test, the taxability of the transaction is determined by looking to the sales and use tax treatment of the property or service that is the “true object”of the transaction and disregarding any property or service that is ancillary or incidental to the property or service constituting the “true object” of the transaction. Louisiana Administrative Revenue Ruling 02-012 (Aug. 30, 2002). In Louisiana Administrative Revenue Ruling 02-012, the Louisiana Department of Revenue considered whether the provision of audience survey information on printed paper documents to radio and television stations was subject to sales and use tax. The department determined that the “true object” of the transaction sought by the stations was the service of collecting the audience survey information and transferring it to the stations. As the department explained, the tangible documents transferred to the stations were merely a means of delivering the content of the surveys and it was the intangible content itself for which the stations had paid. Under these facts, the taxability of the transaction would turn on the tax treatment of the service of collecting, compiling, and transferring audience survey information. Because this is not a taxable service in Louisiana, the department held that the transactions described in the ruling were not subject to sales or use tax. Louisiana Administrative Revenue Ruling 02-012 (Aug. 30, 2002); see also Louisiana Private Letter Ruling 05-003 (March 24, 2005) (discussing work products presented in tangible form that have worth because of technical or professional skills and are considered nontaxable services because the tangible personal property delivered to the client is insignificant in comparison to the services performed). Louisiana courts have reached similar rulings under a broader substance-over-form doctrine. For example, in Monsanto Co. v. St. Charles Par. Sch. Bd., the Louisiana Supreme Court determined that the substance and not the form of a series of contracts should prevail in determining taxability. Monsanto entered into an agreement to sell Texaco, Inc. chemicals necessary to its oil recovery project. Monsanto produced wet chemicals as a by-product of its own manufacturing operation and Texaco needed large quantities of dry chemicals. As part of its sales agreement, Texaco built a conversion facility on Monsanto's site and entered into a separate contract for Monsanto to run the facility in exchange for a fee representing all operating costs incurred by Monsanto. Upon audit, Monsanto was assessed tax on all facility operating costs billed to Texaco on the basis that the only real contract between the two companies was for the sale of the finished product. Accordingly, the court determined that tax should apply to all amounts billed by Monsanto for the sale of the taxable product. Monsanto Co. v. St. Charles Par. Sch. Bd., 646 So. 2d 363 (La. 1994).

Taxable Louisiana imposes sales and use tax on bundled transactions. See Calcasieu Par. Sch. Bd. v. Parker, 827 So. 2d 543 (La. Ct. App. 2002); Schwegmann Bros. Giant Super Mkts. Inc. v. Mouton, 309 So. 2d 686 (La. Ct. App. 1974). If a retailer fails to maintain adequate records of taxable and nontaxable sales as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:309, the Department of Revenue may resort to an audit methodology that does not rely on the retailer's records to determine the retailer's tax due. Thus, where a retailer sells both taxable and nontaxable property or services for a single non-itemized price, the retailer must maintain adequate records to document the amount of the price paid that is allocable to the nontaxable component of the transaction. See Calcasieu Par. Sch. Bd. v. Parker, 827 So. 2d 543 (La. Ct. App. 2002); Schwegmann Bros. Giant Super Mkts. Inc. v. Mouton, 309 So. 2d 686 (La. Ct. App. 1974). BNA-SUTN LA 9.3.2.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Local Jurisdictions, Taxability Distinctions

Differs from State The political subdivisions of Louisiana, including the governing authority of any parish or school board, are authorized to impose local sales and use taxes on the sale, use, lease or rental of tangible personal property or the sale of enumerated services within their geographic jurisdictions. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 47:338.52; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:338.54(A)(1); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.3. Because the terms “sale,” “use,” “lease,” “rental,”and “tangible personal property share the same definitions for both state and local sales and use tax purposes, the same items subject to Louisiana state sales and use tax are, with certain exceptions, also subject to the sales and use taxes imposed by the state's local taxing authorities. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 47:338.25; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 47:338.52; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 47:338.54; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.3. Because the “sales price” on which sales tax is levied and the “cost price”on which use tax is levied have the same definition for both state and local tax purposes, the same tax base rules apply to Louisiana state and local sales and use taxes. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 47:338.26. Under both state and local sales and use tax law, the term “sales of services” is defined to include those services specifically enumerated by statute. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(14); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 47:338.25. Thus, with the limited exception of telecommunications services, which local taxing authorities are prohibited from taxing, the same services subject to tax at the state level, and only those services, are subject to local sales and use taxes. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 47:338.25; La. Admin. Code tit. 61, § 4301(Sales of Services)(a). With respect to the local sales and use tax levied in Calcasieu Parish, sales of services do not include charges for performing aircraft repairs provided the repairs are performed at an airport with a runway that is at least 10,000 feet long, 160 feet wide and 14 inches thick. Currently, only Chennault International Airport in Calcasieu Parish has these runway specifications. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(14)(g)(i)(bb), as amended by 2015 La. H.B. 665, effective May 22, 2015. While there are many more variations among the state and the local taxing jurisdictions in their taxation of property than in their tax treatment of services, these variations are significantly limited as a result of the state's enactment of the Uniform Local Sales Tax Code. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 47:337.1, et seq. These variations, as well as the areas where the tax treatment of property is uniform among the state and local taxing jurisdictions, are discussed below. Exemptions Applicable to Both State and Local Sales and Use Taxes The following is a non-exhaustive list of items that are exempt from both state and local sales and use taxes in Louisiana:• fertilizer and containers sold to farmers; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:305(D)(1)(f); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.9(C)(11). • meals sold to the staff and students of educational institutions, to the staff and patients of hospitals, nursing homes, and adult residential care providers; to the staff, inmates, and patients of mental institutions, and to boarders of rooming housing and occasional meals furnished by educational, religious, or medical organizations in facilities not open to outsiders or the general public; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:305(D)(2), as amended by 2013 La. S.B. 169, effective June 13, 2013; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.9(C)(16). • devices prescribed by dentists; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:305(D)(1)(t); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.9(C)(15). • kidney dialysis machines; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:305(G); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.9(C)(24). • seed sold to farmers; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:305.3; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.9(D)(2). • prosthetic devices prescribed to Medicaid covered individuals; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:305(D)(4)(a), as amended by 2015 La. S.B. 272, effective July 1, 2015. • materials used directly in the collection, separation, treatment, testing, and storage of blood by nonprofit blood collection centers; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(16)(j). • aphaeresis kits and leuko reduction filters used by nonprofit blood collection centers; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(16)(k). • pesticides sold for agricultural purposes; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:305.8; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.9(D)(5). and • food products purchased with USDA food coupons or WIC vouchers. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:305.46; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.9(D)(22). Exemptions Applicable to Local Sales and Use Taxes but Inapplicable to State Sales and Use Taxes The following is a non-exhaustive list of items that are exempt from local but not state sales and use taxes in Louisiana:• payments by radio and television broadcasters for the rights to broadcast film, video, and tapes; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:305(F); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.9(C)(23). • admission tickets sold by Little Theatre organizations; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:305.6; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.9(D)(3). • admission tickets to musical performances of nonprofit musical organizations; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:305.7; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.9(D)(4). and • charges for admission to entertainment events sponsored by domestic nonprofit charitable, religious, and educational organizations when proceeds go to that organization. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:305.13; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.9(D)(9). Optional Exemptions In addition to the required local sales and use tax exemptions, local taxing authorities are permitted to adopt certain optional exemptions. Items exempt from state sales and use tax that local taxing authorities may elect to exempt from their local sales and use taxes include the following:• custom computer software; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:305.52; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.10(E). • prescription drugs administered exclusively to patients by a physician, nurse, or other healthcare professional in a physician's office where patients are not regularly kept as bed patients for 24 hours or more; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.10(A)(1); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:305(D)(5)(c). See the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Louisiana 12.3.1.1 for additional information. • machinery and equipment purchased for use predominately and directly in manufacturing tangible personal property within Louisiana; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.10(I). • the first $50,000 of consideration paid for any item of farm equipment; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:305.25(A); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.10(B). • storm shutter devices; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(10)(ee); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.10(M). • parts and services used to fabricate, modify, or repair railroad rolling stock; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.10(J). and • machinery and equipment purchased by a utility regulated by the Public Service Commission or the New Orleans City Council. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(16)(o)(ii). Mandatory Exemptions for Certain Jurisdictions The following items are required to be exempted from the sales and use taxes imposed by any political subdivision located in Caddo Parish:• vaso-endothelial growth factor (e.g., Visudyne and Macugen); and • complex biologics such as monoclonal antibodies (e.g., Infliximab). La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.10(K) (mandating this exemption only for taxes imposed by political subdivisions located within a parish with a population between 230,000 and 300,000 according to 2000 Federal Decennial Census). Plaquemines Parish In addition to the local sales and use tax exemptions, mandatory and optional, discussed above, local taxing authorities located within Plaquemines Parish are permitted to adopt any sales and use tax exemptions applicable to the sales and use taxes imposed by the state of Louisiana. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.10(C). Uniform Application of Exclusions and Exemptions With respect to the applicability of sales and use tax exclusions and exemptions to local taxes, The Louisiana Supreme Court has ruled the state's constitution requires that legislative tax exclusions must treat all local taxing jurisdictions uniformly. Arrow Aviation Co. v. St. Martin Par. Sch. Bd. Tax Sales Dept., No. 2016-CA-1132, 2016 BL 407950 (La. 2016). The question of uniformity arose in this matter from a refund claim made by Arrow Aviation Company for sales and use taxes paid to St. Martin Parish School Board. Arrow Aviation claimed that sales and use tax should not have been imposed on its charges for repair services to property delivered to customers outside of Louisiana. The company relied on a state statute that excludes charges for certain repair services to tangible personal property that is then delivered out of state, from state sales and use tax, and from sales and use taxes imposed by East Feliciana Parish. Other parishes, municipalities, or school boards are permitted to apply the sales and use tax exclusion, but are not required to do so. See La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(14)(g)(i)(bb)(I). Arrow Aviation argued that the statute was unconstitutional because the sales tax exclusion was not mandatory for all local taxing jurisdictions, including the St. Martin Parish School Board. The Louisiana Supreme Court determined that the statute was unconstitutional, but not for the reasons proposed by Arrow Aviation. Ultimately, the court found that the statute was unconstitutional because the legislative tax exclusion was mandatory only for East Feliciana Parish, and consequently, did not treat “all local governmental subdivisions, school boards, and other political subdivisions” the same, as is required under Louisiana's constitutional provision addressing uniformly applicable tax exclusions. See La. Const. art. VI, § 29(D)(1). The court clarified that the constitutional uniformity provision does not mandate that all local authorities must uniformly apply a legislative tax exclusion but only that a legislative tax exclusion must treat all local authorities the same. Because the exclusion did not apply to all parishes “in the same form, manner, or degree,” the court severed the unconstitutional portion of the statute that made the exclusion mandatory only for East Feliciana Parish but permissive for all other local jurisdictions. The court remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. Arrow Aviation Co. v. St. Martin Par. Sch. Bd. Tax Sales Dept., No. 2016-CA-1132, 2016 BL 407950 (La. 2016).
