Taxable Repair and replacement parts for motor vehicles are subject to sales and use tax. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1811; Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1760. A repair shop or service station must charge sales tax on items transferred to the customer. Maine permits the shop to use either of two ways of handling the transaction. First, the shop can itemize and bill them to the customer as a taxable sale. Second, the shop can maintain the items as one “inventory”and bill them to the customer as a percentage of labor or other supplies. In the second situation, the shop must use one line item, commonly marked “shop supplies.” Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 1. Items that shops typically transfer to the customer include:• air conditioning (A/C) and heater treatment; • A/C oil; • small batteries (e.g., AA batteries); • body filler; • broke fluid or power steering fluid; • brake line fittings; • coolant; • dyes, such as oil or A/C dyes; • electrical or duct tape; • electrical terminals; • electrical wire; • gasket maker or adhesive; • grease and gear lubricant; • hardener; • helicoils; • hose clamps; • keylock parts; • light bulbs for the vehicle; • nuts and bolts; • paint and paint thinner; • pipe sealant; • plastic wire ties; • rubber hoses; • rubberized undercoating; • screws; • silicon; • small nuts, bolts, or fasteners; • solder; • spray trim adhesive; • strip caulking; • thread lock; • touch-up paint; • vacuum fittings; • valve stem caps; • welding rods; • wheel weights; and • wire looms. Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 1. Maine also imposes sales and use tax on a service station or repair shop's purchase of tools and equipment used to repair a vehicle. Supplies used in repair work may or may not be taxable, depending on the circumstances. For sales and use tax purposes, Maine distinguishes between items that are used or consumed by the repairer, and items that are ultimately transferred to the customer's possession. Items that are “used” or consumed in the performance of a service are taxable to the repairer. If sales tax is not paid at the time of purchase, the service station or repair shop must report use tax on these items when they are used. Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 1. Items that are typically used or consumed in the shop's services include:• adhesives and glue; • aerosol products; • battery cleaner; • brake cleaner; • brake lathe bits; • brushes; • buffing compounds and pads; • car wash soap; • choke cleaner; • cleaners; • deodorizer; • disc brake quieter; • drill bits; • engine degreasers and cleaners; • floor dry; • gases, oxygen, and acetylene; • glass cleaner; • gloves; • grinder wheels; • hacksaw blades; • hand cleaner; • key tags; • light bulbs (facility); • masks; • paper mats (floor or seat); • paper towels; • protective eyewear; • putty spreaders; • rags; • razor blades; • sandpaper; • soap; • masking tape; • wash mitts; • washers and solvents; and • wax.

Tire Retreading, Recapping, and Repair Services Maine recognizes that retreading and recapping tires involves the sale of both materials and a service. Thus, Maine allows the shop to itemize and bill separately the charges for materials and labor, in which case sales tax applies to materials charge only. If it is not feasible for the shop to separate out materials and labor, then Maine permits the shop to reported tax on a 50/50 basis (i.e., on the basis of 50 percent of the cost reflecting labor, and 50 percent of the cost reflecting materials). However, that formula only applies to tires that are owned by the customer. Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 1. If tires or tire casings are purchased by the retreading business and processed for sale, then the entire sale price of the retreaded tires is subject to tax. Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 1. The sale of ordinary tire repairs (e.g., fixing a flat or balancing tires) is the sale of a service.

A repair shop or service station must charge sales tax on items transferred to the customer. Maine permits the shop to use either of two ways of handling the transaction. First, the shop can itemize and bill them to the customer as a taxable sale. Second, the shop can maintain the items as one “inventory”and bill them to the customer as a percentage of labor or other supplies. In the second situation, the shop must use one line item, commonly marked “shop supplies.” Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 1. Maine also imposes sales and use tax on a service station or repair shop's purchase of tools and equipment used to repair a vehicle. Supplies used in repair work may or may not be taxable, depending on the circumstances. For sales and use tax purposes, Maine distinguishes between items that are used or consumed by the repairer, and items that are ultimately transferred to the customer's possession. Items that are “used” or consumed in the performance of a service are taxable to the repairer. If sales tax is not paid at the time of purchase, the service station or repair shop must report use tax on these items when they are used. Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 1.

Tire Retreading, Recapping, and Repair Services Maine recognizes that retreading and recapping tires involves the sale of both materials and a service. Thus, Maine allows the shop to itemize and bill separately the charges for materials and labor, in which case sales tax applies to materials charge only. If it is not feasible for the shop to separate out materials and labor, then Maine permits the shop to reported tax on a 50/50 basis (i.e., on the basis of 50 percent of the cost reflecting labor, and 50 percent of the cost reflecting materials). However, that formula only applies to tires that are owned by the customer. Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 1. If tires or tire casings are purchased by the retreading business and processed for sale, then the entire sale price of the retreaded tires is subject to tax. Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 1. The sale of ordinary tire repairs (e.g., fixing a flat or balancing tires) is the sale of a service. The service station or auto repair shop does not charge the customer on materials used in the repair, but it must pay tax on when it purchases those materials. Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 1. Extended Service Contracts for Trucks Beginning Oct. 9, 2013, the sale of an extended service contract on a truck is a taxable service subject to tax.
