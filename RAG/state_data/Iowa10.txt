Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Tangible Personal Property

Destination A taxable sale of tangible personal property or digital goods in Iowa is sourced to the location where the sale is consummated by delivery of the property or product. Iowa Code Ann. §423.15; Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-223.6, as added by 41 Iowa Admin. Bull. No. 18 (Feb. 27, 2019), effective April 3, 2019. In general, the location of a sale (but not the lease or rental) of tangible personal property and digital goods is determined as follows: • if a purchaser receives taxable property or services at a seller's business location, the sale is sourced to that business location; Iowa Code Ann. §423.15(1)(a); Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-223.6, as added by 41 Iowa Admin. Bull. No. 18 (Feb. 27, 2019), effective April 3, 2019. • if a purchaser does not receive taxable property or services at a seller's business location, the sale is sourced to the location where the purchaser or the purchaser's donee receives taxable property or services; Iowa Code Ann. §423.15(1)(b); Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-223.6, as added by 41 Iowa Admin. Bull. No. 18 (Feb. 27, 2019), effective April 3, 2019. • if the location of a sale cannot be determined under the above rules, the sale is sourced to the purchaser's address as indicated by the seller's business records; Iowa Code Ann. §423.15(1)(c); Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-223.6, as added by 41 Iowa Admin. Bull. No. 18 (Feb. 27, 2019), effective April 3, 2019. • if the location of a sale cannot be sourced under any of the above rules, the sale is sourced to the purchaser's address as obtained during the consummation of the sale, such as the address indicated on the purchaser's payment instrument; Iowa Code Ann. §423.15(1)(d). and • if the location of a sale cannot be sourced under any of the above rules, the sale is sourced as follows: if tangible personal property or other taxable property is sold, the sale of such property is sourced to the location from which the property is shipped. If a digital good or computer software delivered electronically is sold, the sale is sourced to the location from which the digital good or computer software was first available for transmission by the seller. If a service is sold, the sale is sourced to the location from which the service was provided. Iowa Code Ann. §423.15(1)(e). Specified Digital Products Sales of taxable digital products in Iowa are sourced in the same manner as sales of tangible personal property. Iowa Code Ann. §423.15; Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-223.6, as added by 41 Iowa Admin. Bull. No. 18 (Feb. 27, 2019), effective April 3, 2019. Sales of Transportation Equipment The retail sale of transportation equipment, including the lease or rental of such equipment, is sourced in the same manner as tangible personal property and digital goods under Iowa Code Ann. §423.15, as above indicated. Iowa Code Ann. §423.15(3). Transportation equipment refers to:• locomotives used for property or passenger transport in interstate commerce; • trucks and truck-tractors with a gross vehicle weight of 10,000 pounds or greater, and trailers, semitrailers, and passenger buses that are both registered through the international registration plan and operated under the authority of a carrier certified by the U.S. Department of Transportation or other federal or foreign authority to engage in property or passenger transport in interstate or foreign commerce; • aircraft operated by air carriers certified by the U.S. Department of Transportation or other federal or foreign authority to engage in property or passenger transport in interstate or foreign commerce; and • containers designed for use on and component parts attached to the above-listed locomotives, vehicles, or aircraft. Iowa Code Ann. §423.15(3)(a) through (d). F.O.B. Sales The terms of a sale as F.O.B. are irrelevant for the purposes of sourcing a sale. The sourcing rules outlined in Iowa Code Ann. §423.15 should be followed regardless of the terms of the sale. Iowa Code Ann. §423.15(b); Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-223.6, as added by 41 Iowa Admin. Bull. No. 18 (Feb. 27, 2019), effective April 3, 2019. Direct Mail Sales Effective July 1, 2011, to conform to the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, Iowa distinguishes between “advertising and promotional direct mail” and “other direct mail.” Iowa Code Ann. §423.1(1); Iowa Code Ann. §423.1(35). The sales of advertising and promotional direct mail are sourced according to destination rules as follows:• A purchaser of advertising and promotional direct mail may provide a seller with a direct pay permit, an agreement certificate of exemption or similar written statement approved, authorized, or accepted by the Department of Revenue, or information showing the jurisdiction where the mail is to be delivered. Iowa Code Ann. §423.19(1)(a). • When a purchaser provides the seller a permit, a certificate of exemption, or an approved written statement the seller is, absent bad faith, relieved of collecting, paying or remitting tax on the advertising and promotional direct mail. The purchaser must source the sale to the jurisdiction where the mail is delivered. Iowa Code Ann. §423.19(1)(b)(1). • When the purchaser provides the seller only information showing the jurisdiction where the advertising and promotional direct mail is to be delivered, the seller must source the sale to that location. The seller must collect and remit tax based on the sourcing information. A seller relying on this information, absent bad faith, is relieved of any further obligation to collect tax on the sale. Iowa Code Ann. §423.19(1)(b)(2). The sale of other direct mail generally is sourced to the address of the purchaser as indicated by the seller's business records. Iowa Code Ann. §423.19(2)(a). A purchaser may, however, provide the seller with a direct pay permit, an agreement certificate of exemption claiming to be direct mail, or a similar written statement approved, authorized or accepted by the Department of Revenue. Iowa Code Ann. §423.19(2)(b). When the purchaser provides a direct pay permit, certificate of exemption, or an approved written statement, the seller is relieved of the obligation to collect, pay, or remit tax. The sale of the other direct mail is then sourced to the jurisdiction where the mail is delivered to the recipient, and the purchaser must report and pay any tax. Iowa Code Ann. §423.19(2)(c). Prior to July 1, 2011, direct mail sales were sourced to the location from which the direct mail was shipped, unless the purchaser provided the seller with a direct pay permit, or information indicating the appropriate taxing jurisdiction that was the ultimate destination of the property purchased via direct mail. Iowa Code Ann. §423.19 (2010). BNA-SUTN IA 4.1.1.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Services

Destination Iowa sales tax applies to the sale of a service sourced in the state based on where the first use of the service occurs. Iowa Code Ann. §423.15. Iowa sources the sale of a service performed on tangible personal property to the location where the customer receives, regains possession of, or can potentially make first use (regardless of whether actually used) of the property on which the service was performed. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-223.3(1). The Iowa regulation clarifies that generally this location is where the property is returned to the purchaser or the purchaser's donee. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-223.3(1). However, the sourcing of sales of personal care services is based on the location where the services are performed, that is, the same location where the purchaser or purchaser's donee receives the services. The purchaser or donee receives the services either at the seller's location, or at the purchaser's location. Iowa Code Ann. §423.15(1)(a); Iowa Code Ann. §423.15(1)(b); Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-223.4(2). Personal care services are defined as services performed on the human body and include, barber and beauty services, massage (except services of licensed massage therapists), reflexology, reducing salons, and tanning beds and salons. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-223.4(2). Sourcing Telecommunications Services and Ancillary Services Sales of telecommunications services are sourced according to the following rules: • Sales of telecommunications services that are sold on a call-by-call basis are generally sourced to the taxing jurisdiction where the call originates and terminates, if the call originates and terminates in the same jurisdiction, or to the taxing jurisdiction where the service address is located and where the call either originates or terminates. Iowa Code Ann. §423.20(2)(a). • Sales of telecommunications services that are sold on a basis other than a call-by-call basis are generally sourced to the location of the customer's place of primary use. Iowa Code Ann. §423.20(2)(b). • Sales of mobile telecommunications service, other than sales of air-to-ground radiotelephone service or prepaid calling service, are sourced to the location that is customer's place of primary use, as required by the federal Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act. Iowa Code Ann. §423.20(2)(c)(1). • Sales of postpaid calling service are sourced to the location where the signal of the telecommunications service originates, as first identified by the seller's telecommunications system or, if the signal is not transmitted by the seller's telecommunications system, as identified by information that the seller received from the seller's service provider. Iowa Code Ann. §423.20(2)(c)(2). • Sales of prepaid calling service or prepaid wireless calling service are sourced according to the location determined under the general sourcing rules of Iowa Code Ann. §423.15(1)(e). Iowa Code Ann. §423.20(2)(c)(3). Sales of private communications services are sourced according to the following rules:• Sales of a private communication service for a separate charge related to a customer channel termination point are sourced to the location of the customer channel termination point. Iowa Code Ann. §423.20(2)(c)(4)(a). • Sales of a private communication service in which all customer channel termination points are located entirely in one taxing jurisdiction are sourced to the taxing jurisdiction in which the customer channel termination points are located. Iowa Code Ann. §423.20(2)(c)(4)(b). • If the segments are charged separately, the sale of a private communication service that represents segments of a communications channel between two customer channel termination points that are located in different taxing jurisdictions is sourced to an equal percentage in both such jurisdictions. Iowa Code Ann. §423.20(2)(c)(4)(c). • If the segments are not charged separately, the sale of a private communication service for segments of a communication channel that is located in more than one taxing jurisdiction is sourced to each such jurisdiction in a percentage determined by dividing the number of customer channel termination points in that jurisdiction by the number of customer channel termination points in all jurisdictions where segments of the communications channel are located. Iowa Code Ann. §423.20(2)(c)(4)(d). Sourcing of Tickets and Admissions Sales of tickets or admissions to places of amusements, fairs, or athletic events are sourced in the same manner as services. Sales of services are generally sourced to the location where the purchaser makes first use of the service. Under Iowa's sourcing rules, events that the purchaser attends at a physical location are “first used” at the location of the event. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-223.5, as added by 41 Iowa Admin. Bull. No. 18 (Feb. 27, 2019), effective April 3, 2019. For virtual events, the first use occurs at the location where the attendee first participates in or accesses the event, if known to the seller. If the seller does not know the location where the attendee first participates in or accesses the event, the sale is sourced to the purchaser's address, as indicated by the seller's business records. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-223.5(1), as added by 41 Iowa Admin. Bull. No. 18 (Feb. 27, 2019), effective April 3, 2019; see Iowa Code Ann. §423.15(1)(c). Admissions that may be used at multiple locations should be sourced to the location where the admission is purchased if the purchaser picks it up in person and it can be used at that location. If the service cannot be used at that location, or the sale is made online, the sale is sourced to the purchaser's address, as indicated by the seller's business records. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-223.5(2), as added by 41 Iowa Admin. Bull. No. 18 (Feb. 27, 2019), effective April 3, 2019; see Iowa Code Ann. §423.15(1)(c). Sourcing for Memberships Purchases of memberships often allow the customer access to facilities or events in more than one taxing jurisdiction. As memberships are considered services, the purchase of the membership is sourced to the place of first use. Iowa Code Ann. §423.15; Iowa Revenue Policy Letter No. 16300064 (Sept. 29, 2016). Sourcing for Passenger Transportation Beginning Jan. 1, 2019, the sales price from rendering passenger transportation services is sourced to where the service is first received. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-26.80(2), as added by 41 Admin. Bull. issue 14 (Jan. 2, 2019), effective Feb. 6, 2019. BNA-SUTN IA 4.1.2.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Leases and Rentals

Depends Tangible personal property that is leased or rented is subject to general sourcing rules unless the property is classified as “transportation equipment”. Iowa Code Ann. §423.15(2)(a); Iowa Code Ann. §423.15(2)(b). For example, except as provided below for leases and rentals of motor vehicles, trailers, semitrailers, and aircraft, not constituting “transportation equipment,” the first payment on the lease or rental of taxable property is sourced to the location determined under the general sourcing rules set forth in Iowa Code Ann. §423.15. Iowa Code Ann. §423.15(2)(a); Iowa Code Ann. §423.15(2)(b). Subsequent periodic payments on the lease or rental, if any, are sourced to the property's primary location as indicated by an address that is provided by the lessee and that is available in records that the lessor maintains in the ordinary course of business, when the use of the address does not constitute bad faith. Iowa Code Ann. §423.15(2)(a). For the lease or rental of motor vehicles, trailers, semitrailers, or aircraft that do not qualify as transportation equipment requiring periodic payments, each periodic payment is sourced to the primary property location. The primary property location, which cannot be changed by intermittent use of the property at different locations, is determined by an address for the property provided by the lessee that is available to the lessor from its records maintained in the ordinary course of business, when use of this address does not constitute bad faith. Iowa Code Ann. §423.17(1). Leases or rentals of such property that do not require recurring payments are sourced under the general sourcing rules set forth in Iowa Code Ann. §423.15. Iowa Code Ann. §423.17(2). The lease or rental of transportation equipment, is sourced in the same manner as tangible personal products and digital goods pursuant to Iowa Code Ann. §423.15. Iowa Code Ann. §423.15(3). BNA-SUTN IA 4.1.3.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Local Sourcing

Destination-Based The sourcing rules for applying the local option sales and service tax are the same as those utilized for the state-level sales and service tax. Iowa Code Ann. §423.15; Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-223.3(2), as amended by 41 Iowa Admin. Bull. No. 18 (Feb. 27, 2019), effective April 3, 2019. Note that Iowa does not impose a local option use tax. If a county imposes a local sales and services tax, however, it must impose a local excise tax on the purchase price of natural gas, natural gas service, electricity, or electric services taxable under chapter 423, subchapter III and not otherwise exempt. This local excise tax applies to the use of the services in the counties where it is imposed. Iowa Code Ann. §423B.5; Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-107.6 to 107.7, as amended by 41 Iowa Admin. Bull. No. 18 (Feb. 27, 2019), effective April 3, 2019; Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-223.3(2), as amended by 41 Iowa Admin. Bull. No. 18 (Feb. 27, 2019), effective April 3, 2019. For purposes of the local option sales and service tax, sales of services performed on tangible personal property are sourced to the local taxing jurisdiction where the customer regains possession or where the customer can potentially make first use of the property on which the seller performed the service. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-223.3(2), as amended by 41 Iowa Admin. Bull. No. 18 (Feb. 27, 2019), effective April 3, 2019. County governments may impose the local option service tax on any service that is subject to the Iowa state sales tax when that service is performed within an area of the county. Iowa Code Ann. §422B.8; Iowa Code Ann. §423B.5; Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-107.6, as amended by 41 Iowa Admin. Bull. No. 18 (Feb. 27, 2019), effective April 3, 2019. However, an enumerated service is only taxable at the local level if performance of the service physically occurs within the local jurisdictional limits. It is immaterial whether the parties enter into a contract for the performance of services within the taxing jurisdiction or outside the taxing jurisdiction. It further does not matter whether the service provider's central office location or supply headquarters is within the taxing jurisdiction or outside the taxing jurisdiction. The sole determinative factor is whether the taxable service physically occurs within the taxing jurisdiction. Iowa Code Ann. §423.15; Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-223.3(2), as amended by 41 Iowa Admin. Bull. No. 18 (Feb. 27, 2019), effective April 3, 2019. Sales on Excursion Boats Iowa permits taxpayers to use an apportionment formula to determine where to source sales occurring on excursion gambling boats that move through multiple local jurisdictions. The formula must rationally apportion the vessel's progress among the jurisdictions, and may be based on distance or time. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-107.12, as amended by 41 Iowa Admin. Bull. No. 18 (Feb. 27, 2019), effective April 3, 2019. BNA-SUTN IA 4.1.4.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Credit for Tax Paid to Another Jurisdiction

Yes Iowa allows a credit for sales or use tax or occupation tax already paid in another state on tangible personal property, specified digital products, or enumerated services subsequently brought into or used in Iowa. Iowa Code Ann. §423.22, as amended by 2018 Iowa S.F. 2417, §207, effective Jan. 1, 2019. If the tax imposed and paid in the other state is equal to or more than the Iowa tax, then Iowa's tax is not due on the personal property or services. If the amount of the tax imposed by the other state is less than Iowa's tax, then Iowa tax applies, but at a rate measured by the difference only between the Iowa tax and the rate by which the previous tax on the sale or use, or the occupation tax, was computed. Iowa Code Ann. §423.22, as amended by 2018 Iowa S.F. 2417, §207, effective Jan. 1, 2019; Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-30.7(423); Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-223.2, as amended by 41 Iowa Admin. Bull. No. 18 (Feb. 27, 2019), effective April 3, 2019. A credit is not allowed, however, for sales, use, or occupational tax paid to another state on the gross receipts of the lease or rental payments of tangible personal property used in another state. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-30.7. With respect to sales of services, Iowa use tax may apply even if another state determines that an Iowa purchaser owes sales tax based on first use, when subsequent to the first use in another state, the product or result of the service is used in Iowa. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-30.7; Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-223.2(1). A person claiming an exemption from use tax on the grounds that tax has already been paid in another state bears the burden of showing documented proof that the tax has been paid. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-30.7(423). BNA-SUTN IA 4.2.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Temporary Presence, In-Transit Property Tangible Personal Property Purchased for Use Out-of-state

Exemptions Allowed Iowa exempts from sales tax the sale of property or services performed on property that are shipped outside the state via carrier, U.S. mail, or in the retailer's own vehicles, provided the property does not return to Iowa other than in the course of interstate commerce transportation. Iowa Code Ann. §423.3(43). The sales tax exemption does not apply when the purchaser, consumer, or his or her agent, other than a carrier, takes physical possession of the property in Iowa. Iowa Code Ann. §423.3(43). Iowa exempts from use tax tangible personal property that becomes an integral part, by fabrication, compounding, or manufacturing, of a vehicle that is manufactured for lease and actually leased for use outside the state, and that subsequently is used in Iowa solely in interstate commerce or interstate transportation. The exemption does not apply to vehicles subject to registration that are designed primarily for carrying persons. Iowa Code Ann. §423.6(8). “Vehicle” in this context refers to a trailer, semitrailer, road tractor, or motor truck. See Iowa Code Ann. §321.1 (providing definitions). A sales tax exemption is allowed for the sale or rental of aircraft used in a scheduled interstate air carrier operation certificated by the Federal Aviation Administration(FAA), and for the sale or rental of tangible personal property permanently affixed to such aircraft, including repair and replacement parts. The exemption also applies to the sales price of all services used to repair, remodel, and maintain such aircraft, aircraft engines, or aircraft component materials or part. Iowa Code Ann. §423.3(75) and (76). Iowa also exempts from use tax aircraft for use in a scheduled interstate air carrier operation certificated by the FAA. Iowa Code Ann. §423.6(12). The sales price from services performed on a vessel is exempt from sales tax if:• the vessel is licensed under the laws of the U.S. Coast Guard; • the service is used to repair or restore a defect in the vessel; • the vessel is engaged in interstate commerce and will continue in interstate commerce once the repairs or restoration is complete; and • the vessel is in navigable waters bordering a boundary of Iowa.
