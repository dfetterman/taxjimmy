See, e.g., Kenai Peninsula Borough Finance Dept., Sales Tax Home. The taxability of a sale of goods is typically determined by the place where the sale occurs, and the taxability of services and the rental of property are determined by the place where the service is performed or where the rental property is located.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Credit for Tax Paid to Another Jurisdiction
