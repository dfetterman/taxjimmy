Nontaxable Ohio does not impose sales and use tax on sales of real property. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.02(A)(1). Ohio defines “real property” as realty and land including all growing crops, trees, plants, and shrubs, all buildings, structures, improvements, and fixtures of whatever kind on the land, and all rights and privileges belonging or appertaining to such property. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5701.02(A); see also Palace Hotels, LLC v. Testa, Ohio Board of Tax Appeals Decision No. 2016-1300 (March 5, 2018) (finding a roof, fiberglass decking, plumbing, electrical, and concrete foundations to be real property). BNA-SUTN OH 28.1.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal General Rule for Classification

Three-part Test Ohio uses a three-part test to determine whether tangible personal property has been affixed to real property. Funtime, Inc. v Wilkins, 822 N.E.2d 781, 2004 Ohio 6890 (Ohio 2004). In making this determination, Ohio considers the following:1) whether the property has become actually annexed to the real property; 2)whether the property increases or enhances utilization or enjoyment of the land; and 3) the intention of the party making the annexation to permanently attach the item to the real property. Funtime, Inc. v Wilkins, 822 N.E.2d 781, 2004 Ohio 6890 (Ohio 2004) (quoting Zangerle v. Standard Oil Co. of Ohio, 60 N.E.2d 52 (Ohio 1945). Ohio further differentiates between fixtures and “business fixtures.” Ohio Admin. Code §5703-9-14(B); see also Funtime, Inc. v Wilkins, 822 N.E.2d 781, 2004 Ohio 6890 (Ohio 2004) (amusement rides affixed to amusement park were taxable business fixtures because they would not be of benefit to a real property occupant engaged in a different business); Hoffman Props. LP v. Testa, Ohio Board of Tax Appeals Decision No. 2011-1372 (April 29, 2014) (specialized irrigation system affixed to golf course was a taxable business fixture because it was designed to address the unique needs of operating a golf course), aff'd 2015 BL 313185 (Ohio Ct. App. 2015). Tangible personal property is a fixture if it has become permanently attached or affixed to the land or to a building, structure, or improvement, and primarily benefits the real property rather than the business conducted on the premises. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5701.02(C). Property is a “business fixture”if it primarily benefits the business, if any, conducted on the real property (e.g., machinery, equipment, signs, or storage bins). Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5701.03(B); Ohio Admin. Code §5703-9-14(B). “Business fixture” includes machinery, equipment, signs, storage bins and tanks, whether above or below ground, and broadcasting, transportation, transmission, and distribution systems, whether above or below ground. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5701.03(B); see also Pep Boys - Manny, Moe & Jack of Del., Inc. v. Testa, No. 2015-706 (Ohio B.T.A. 2016) (stating that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5701.03(B) “clearly contemplates that signs and equipment, that are permanently attached to the land and that benefit the specific business conducted thereon, are taxable”). “Business fixture” also means those portions of buildings, structures, and improvements specially designed, constructed, and used for the business conducted in the building, structure, or improvement, including, but not limited to, foundations and supports for machinery and equipment. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5701.03(B). “Business fixture” does not include fixtures that are common to buildings, including, but not limited to, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems primarily used to control the environment for people or animals, tanks, towers, and lines for potable water or water for fire control, electrical and communication lines, and other fixtures that primarily benefit the realty and not the business conducted by the occupant on the premises. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5701.03(B). Fixtures are nontaxable real property in Ohio; however, business fixtures retain their character as taxable tangible personal property. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5701.02(C). BNA-SUTN OH 28.2.1.

Charges for the sale and installation of such items are treated as a construction contract and are not taxable. Ohio Information Release ST 1994-01; Ohio Opinion of the Tax Commissioner No. 91-0001 (May 23, 1991). Window Treatments Ohio does not specifically address the taxability of window treatments. See Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §§5739.01-5739.99. Whether or not window treatments are taxable depends on whether such items become annexed to real property. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5701.02(C). Window treatments that are easily removed, such as standard curtains and draperies are taxable as tangible personal property. Both the sale and installation of such items is taxable in Ohio. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.01(H)(1)(a)(v); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5701.02(C). However, more permanent installations such as awnings or shades, are considered real property. Charges for the sale and installation of these items are treated as nontaxable charges under a construction contract. Ohio Admin. Code §5703-3-01(B)(2). BNA-SUTN OH 28.2.4.

Depends Ohio sales and use tax does not apply to construction contracts. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.01(B)(5); Ohio Information Release ST 2003-01. Instead, Ohio law imposes sales and use tax on the purchase, lease, rental, consumption, or use of machinery, equipment, supplies, tools, and other tangible personal property used by a construction contractor in completing a construction contract. Ohio Admin. Code §5703-9-14(H). Likewise, the repair or installation of any of these items is also subject to taxation. Ohio Admin. Code §5703-9-14(H). The contractor is responsible for paying the applicable tax on any tangible personal property or service used in completing the construction contract. Ohio Admin. Code §5703-9-14(D)(1); Durabilt Inc. v. Testa (Ohio Ct. App., 5th Dist. 2011). A construction contract is any agreement, whether written or oral, in which tangible personal property is incorporated into real property so that it becomes part of the real property. A construction contract can be for either new construction or for addition or alteration to a previously existing structure. Ohio Admin. Code §5703-9-14(A). A construction contractor is anyone that performs construction contracts, and includes both primary contractors and subcontractors. Ohio Admin. Code §5703-9-14(A).

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Construction Materials and Contracts Lump-Sum Construction Contracts, Contractor's Purchases of Materials

Taxable A construction contractor who purchases materials or taxable services for incorporation into real property is the consumer of these materials or services and must pay sales or use tax on their purchase price, unless the contractor manufactures or fabricates items for incorporation into real property or is performing work on a nontaxable construction contract. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.01(B)(5); Ohio Admin. Code §5703-9-14(D). Items purchased by contractors may be found to be purchased for resale if the contractee has ultimate control over the items. In one case, the commissioner alleged that traffic maintenance items were purchased for use by the taxpayer in fulfilling a contract for construction services instead acquired for lease or rental to its customer. However, because the customer had control over exactly which items were used, when they were used, and how they were used, it was found that the traffic maintenance items were in fact leased to the customer. Therefore the taxpayer's initial purchase of the items was for resale. Karvo Paving, Co. v. Testa, Ohio Board of Tax Appeals Decision No. 2016-782 (Jan. 4, 2018). BNA-SUTN OH 28.3.3.

If the person elects to be treated as a manufacturer, the purchase of all raw materials may be exempt from the tax on the basis that they will be incorporated as a material or part into an item manufactured for sale. The manufacturer must accrue and pay use tax on the price of any self-manufactured item subsequently consumed in performing a taxable construction contract, or in any other taxable manner. If the person elects to be treated as a construction contractor, the person must pay sales or use tax on the acquisition cost of all raw materials, unless such materials are ultimately consumed in performing a nontaxable construction contract.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Contractor Classifications

Yes Retailer-contractors A construction contractor that purchases tangible personal property to be incorporated into real property and that also makes substantial sales of the same type of tangible personal property is entitled to purchase such property free from sales and use tax under the sale for resale exclusion as a retailer. Ohio Admin. Code §5703-9-14(E). Any tangible personal property purchased under this exemption that is ultimately incorporated into real property pursuant to a construction contract is subject to the use tax. The contractor must remit the appropriate amount of use tax due under such circumstances. Ohio Admin. Code §5703-9-14(E). Contractors as Manufacturers A contractor that manufactures or fabricates tangible personal property, sells some of the property, and incorporates some into real property pursuant to construction contracts must elect whether to be treated as a manufacturer or a construction contractor when purchasing the raw materials used to manufacture or fabricate the tangible personal property. The contractor does not need to notify the department about the election and may elect to be treated differently on the purchase of raw materials for distinct manufactured items. The law requires a contractor to maintain complete records detailing how each purchase of raw materials was treated for tax purposes. Ohio Admin. Code §5703-9-14(F)(1). Election to be Treated as a Manufacturer If a contractor elects to be treated as a manufacturer, then all raw materials purchased may be exempt from tax as they will become a part of an item manufactured for sale. The contractor must accrue and pay use tax on any self-manufactured item later used in the completion of a construction contract. Ohio Admin. Code §5703-9-14(F)(1)(a). Election to be Treated as a Construction Contractor If a contractor elects to be treated as a construction contractor, then the contractor must pay sales or use tax on purchases of any materials used in the manufacturing process. The tax base is the acquisition cost. The only exception to this rule is if the ultimate manufactured product is used in completing a non-taxable construction contract.
