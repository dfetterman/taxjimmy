Destination Generally, in Georgia, a sale of a taxable item is sourced to the business location of the seller. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-77(b)(1). The retail sale of a tangible personal property is sourced as follows:• When the product is received by the purchaser at a business location of the seller, the sale is sourced to that business location. • When the product is not received by the purchaser at a business location of the seller, the sale is sourced to the location where receipt by the purchaser, or the purchaser's donee, designated as such by the purchaser, occurs, including the location indicated by instructions for delivery to the purchaser or donee, known to the seller. • When neither of the above applies, the sale is sourced to the location indicated by an address for the purchaser that is available from the business records of the seller that are maintained in the ordinary course of the seller's business when use of this address does not constitute bad faith. • When none of the above applies, the sale is sourced to the location indicated by an address for the purchaser obtained during the consummation of the sale, including the address of a purchaser's payment instrument, if no other address is available, when use of this address does not constitute bad faith. • When none of the above applies, including the circumstance in which the seller is without sufficient information to apply the previous rules, then the location will be determined by the address from which tangible personal property was shipped, from which the digital good or the computer software delivered electronically was first available for transmission by the seller, or from which the service was provided, disregarding for these purposes any location that merely provided the digital transfer of the product sold. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-77(b)(1). For the purpose of sourcing tangible personal property, the terms “receive” and “receipt”mean:• taking possession of tangible personal property; • making first use of services; or • taking possession or making first use of digital goods, whichever comes first. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-77(c). The terms “receive” and “receipt”do not include possession by a shipping company on behalf of the purchaser. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-77(c). Transportation Equipment The retail sale, including lease or rental, of transportation equipment is sourced the same as a retail sale of other tangible personal property. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-77(b)(4). For the purpose of sourcing, “transportation equipment” means any of the following:• locomotives and railcars that are utilized for the carriage of persons or property in interstate commerce; • trucks and truck-tractors with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of 10,001 pounds or greater, trailers, semitrailers, or passenger buses that are: (i)registered through the International Registration Plan; and (ii) operated under authority of a carrier authorized and certificated by the U.S. Department of Transportation or another federal authority to engage in the carriage of persons or property in interstate commerce; or • aircraft that are operated by air carriers authorized and certificated by the U.S. Department of Transportation or another federal or a foreign authority to engage in the carriage of persons or property in interstate or foreign commerce. Advertising and Direct Mail “Advertising and promotional direct mail”means “direct mail” as defined under Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-2(12) the primary purpose of which is to attract public attention to a product, person, business, or organization, or to attempt to sell, popularize, or secure financial support for a product, person, business, or organization. For the purpose of sourcing advertising and direct mail, the term “product”means tangible personal property, a product transferred electronically, or a service. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-77(d)(3)(A). Advertising and promotional direct mail are sourced as follows:• If the purchaser provides the seller with either (i) a direct pay permit, or (ii) a direct mail exemption certificate or other written statement approved, authorized, or accepted by the state, the purchaser must source the sale to the jurisdictions to which the material is to be delivered to the recipients. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-77(d)(1)(B). • If the purchaser provides the seller information showing the jurisdictions to which the advertising and promotional direct mail is to be delivered to recipients, the seller must source the sale to those jurisdictions. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-77(d)(1)(C). • If the purchaser does not provide the seller with a direct pay permit, an exemption certificate or similar acceptable document, or delivery jurisdiction information, the sale must be sourced to the address from which the material was shipped. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-77(d)(1)(D). “Other direct mail” means any direct mail that is not advertising and promotional direct mail regardless of whether advertising and promotional direct mail is included in the same mailing. The term includes, but is not limited to:• transactional direct mail that contains personal information specific to the addressee including, but not limited to, invoices, bills, statements of account, and payroll advices; • any legally required mailings including, but not limited to, privacy notices, tax reports, and stockholder reports; and • other non-promotional direct mail delivered to existing or former shareholders, customers, employees, or agents including, but not limited to, newsletters and informational messages. Other direct mail does not include the development of billing information or the provision of any data processing service that is more than incidental. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-77(d)(3)(B). Other direct mail is sourced as follows:• If the purchaser of other direct mail provides the seller with a direct pay permit, exemption certificate, or other written statement acceptable to the state, the sale is sourced to the jurisdictions to which the materials are to be delivered. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-77(d)(2)(C). • If the purchaser of other direct mail does not provide the seller with a direct pay permit, exemption certificate, or other written statement acceptable to the state, the sale is sourced to the location indicated by an address for the purchaser that is available from the business of the records of the seller that are maintained in the ordinary course of the seller's business when use of this address does not constitute bad faith. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-77(d)(2)(A). The advertising and direct mail sourcing provisions only apply to the sale of services if the services are an integral part of the production and distribution of printed material that meets the definition of “direct mail.” Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-77(d)(4)(A)(i).

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Credit for Tax Paid to Another Jurisdiction

Yes Georgia provides a credit for sales or use tax legally imposed and previously paid in any state which grants a credit for a like tax paid in Georgia. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-42; Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-1-.32. However, if the amount of tax paid to a reciprocating state is not equal to or greater than the amount of tax imposed by Georgia, the taxpayer must remit an amount which when added the state tax paid in the reciprocating state will equal the tax imposed by Georgia. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-42; Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-1-.32. Credit for taxes paid to another state only applies to taxes paid before Georgia state tax becomes due.
