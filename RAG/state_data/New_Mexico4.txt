N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-56. Receipts of a carrier from transporting property for the seller of the property who prepays the transportation charges may be deducted from the carrier's gross receipts if the seller issues the carrier a nontaxable transaction certificate. The seller must separately state the transportation charges in its billing, and the sale of the transportation service and property must be in the ordinary course of the seller's business and subject to the gross receipts tax on its subsequent sale. Otherwise, the seller will be liable for compensating tax on such transaction. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.206.14. If a seller of tangible personal property employs a contract or common carrier to transport that property and delivers a nontaxable transaction certificate (NTTC) to the carrier, and if the receipts from the sale of the property are not subject to the gross receipts tax, the seller will be subject to the compensating tax on the value of the transportation service purchased.
