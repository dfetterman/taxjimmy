These charges included “airport customer facility charges” that airports added to any car rental transaction beginning at the airport; “concession and access fees”that airports add for the privilege of operating an on-airport rental car service; and satellite radio service charges that a customer would incur by activating elective satellite radio service. The Oklahoma Tax Commission concluded that all of these charges constituted gross receipts, and therefore, were subject to sales and use tax. Oklahoma Letter Ruling LR-15-038 (June 28, 2016).
