State: Illinois



Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Aircraft, Intrastate or Non-Commercial Use Purchase, Lease, or Rental Transactions

Taxable Illinois imposes Retailers' Occupation Tax and Use Tax on retail sales of aircraft. See 35 ILCS 120/2; 35 ILCS 105/3. If the transaction is not a retail sale (e.g., it is a transfer by gift or is a casual or isolated sale), then Illinois imposes Aircraft Use Tax on the transaction. See 35 ILCS 157/10-15(i) (stating that the Aircraft Use Tax does not apply if aircraft's use is otherwise taxed under the Use Tax Act). For more information regarding the Aircraft Use Tax, see Excise Taxes Navigator, at Illinois 9.4. Temporary Presence in State Illinois exempts from Use Tax three situations in which an aircraft is present in Illinois only temporarily. 35 ILCS 105/3-55(h-2); 35 ILCS 120/2-5(25-7). The three exemptions are for aircraft that leave Illinois within 15 days after final billing or all relevant approvals (‘fly-away’), 35 ILCS 105/3-55(h-2)(1); 35 ILCS 120/2-5(25-7); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.605(b)(2). aircraft temporarily located in Illinois for a prepurchase evaluation, 35 ILCS 105/3-55(h-2)(2). and aircraft temporarily located in Illinois for post-sale customization. 35 ILCS 105/3-55(h-2)(3). Illinois has a general temporary storage exemption, which provides that use tax does not apply to the temporary storage of tangible personal property that is acquired outside Illinois and that, after being brought into Illinois and stored there temporarily, is used solely outside Illinois or is physically attached to or incorporated into other tangible personal property that is used solely outside Illinois, or is altered by converting, fabricating, manufacturing, printing, processing, or shaping, and, as altered, is used solely outside Illinois. 35 ILCS 105/3-55(e). Demonstration or Interim Use Retailers who purchase an aircraft for resale and subsequently use the aircraft for demonstration purposes for a period exceeding 18 months must pay Use Tax on the original cost price of the aircraft. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 150.306(c); see Illinois General Information Letter ST 14-0030-GIL (May 5, 2014); see also Illinois General Information Letter ST 17-0029-GIL (July 31, 2017).

Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Aircraft, Intrastate or Non-Commercial Use Repair and Replacement Parts

Taxable Repair and replacement parts for aircraft used intrastate or for non-commercial purposes are taxable as tangible personal property. 35 ILCS 105/3; 35 ILCS 110/3; 35 ILCS 115/3; 35 ILCS 120/2. Prior to January 1, 2015, Illinois exempted materials, parts, components, and furnishings used by a qualified person to modify, refurbish, complete, replace, repair, or maintain aircraft. 35 ILCS 105/3-5(35); 35 ILCS 110/3-5(27); 35 ILCS 115/3-5(29); 35 ILCS 120/2-5(40); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.120(rr). This exemption applied only to the use of qualifying tangible personal property by persons who modified, refurbished, completed, repaired, replaced, or maintained aircraft and who (i) held an Air Agency Certificate and were empowered to operate an approved repair station by the Federal Aviation Administration, (ii) had a Class IV Rating, and (iii) conducted operations in accordance with Part 145 of the Federal Aviation Regulations. The exemption did not include aircraft operated by a commercial air carrier providing scheduled passenger air service pursuant to authority issued under Part 121 or Part 129 of the Federal Aviation Regulations. 35 ILCS 105/3-5(35); 35 ILCS 110/3-5(27); 35 ILCS 115/3-5(29); 35 ILCS 120/2-5(40); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.120(rr). Property Used or Consumed by an Aircraft Maintenance Facility to Repair Aircraft Illinois exempts from the Retailers' Occupation Tax all tangible personal property used or consumed by an aircraft maintenance facility directly in maintaining, rebuilding, or repairing aircraft. To qualify, the tangible personal property must be consumed within an Illinois Enterprise Zone. The exemption includes the repair and replacement parts for machinery or equipment used primarily in maintaining, rebuilding, or repairing aircraft. It also includes equipment, fuels, and materials and supplies for the machinery's maintenance, repair or operation. 35 ILCS 120/1n. The term “aircraft maintenance facility”means a facility operated by an interstate carrier for hire that is used primarily for the maintenance, rebuilding or repair of aircraft, aircraft parts and auxiliary equipment owned or leased by that carrier and used by that carrier as rolling stock moving in interstate commerce. 35 ILCS 120/1k. Moreover, to qualify for the exemption, the interstate carrier for hire must:• make an investment of $400,000,000 or more in an enterprise zone; 35 ILCS 120/1k(1). • cause the creation of at least 5,000 full-time jobs in that enterprise zone; 35 ILCS 120/1k(2). • be located in a county with a population not less than 150,000 and not more than 200,000 and that contains three enterprise zones as of Dec. 31, 1990; 35 ILCS 120/1k(3). • enter into a legally binding agreement with the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity to comply with investment and job creation within a specified period of time; 35 ILCS 120/1k(4). and • be certified by the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity to be in compliance with all requirements. 35 ILCS 120/1k(5).

Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Aircraft, Intrastate or Non-Commercial Use Maintenance Services

Nontaxable Generally, services themselves are not subject to taxation because they are not included in the definition of a sale at retail. 35 ILCS 120/1; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.120. However, service occupation tax is imposed on tangible property transferred as an incident of a sale a service. 35 ILCS 115/3. Repairs made incident to maintenance agreements and extended warranties are taxable because the agreements are not included in the sales price and have not been subject to service occupation tax. Repairs made by a seller (e.g., retailer or manufacturer) who is not obligated to make the repair under a warranty included in the retail selling price of the item result in tax liability. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §140.141(c). BNA-SUTN IL 29.1.5.

Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Aircraft, Intrastate or Non-Commercial Use Fuel

Depends Illinois treats fuel as tangible personal property, and before Jan. 1, 2020 sales of fuel are subject to the Retailers’ Occupation Tax and Use Tax, unless subject to a specific exemption. See 35 ILCS 120/2; 35 ILCS 105/3; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.101; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §150.101. Effective Jan. 1, 2020, sellers of aviation fuel at retail, or servicemen who transfer aviation fuel as part of a service, must instead file an aviation fuel tax return on or before the 20th day of each calendar month and pay aviation fuel tax payments to the Department. The vendor collection discount will not be available for those remitting the aviation fuel tax. 35 ILCS 105/9, 35 ILCS 115/9, and 35 ILCS 120/3, all amended by 2019 Ill. S.B. 1814, effective Jan. 1, 2020. Illinois exempts from Use Tax any fuel or petroleum products sold to a qualified air carrier. 35 ILCS 105/3-5(12); 35 ILCS 105/3-5(8); 35 ILCS 120/2-5(22); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.120(dd), as amended by 43 Ill. Reg. 4201 (April 5, 2019), effective March 20, 2019. To qualify for the exemption, the air common carrier must certify the fuel or petroleum products will be used for consumption, shipment, or storage for a flight that is engaged in foreign trade or trade to a U.S. possession. The air common carrier must transport at least one package or person from the city of the flight's origin to the destination city, regardless of whether the flight number changes. 35 ILCS 105/3-5(12); 35 ILCS 105/3-5(8); 35 ILCS 115/3-5(8); 35 ILCS 120/2-5(22); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.120(dd), as amended by 43 Ill. Reg. 4201 (April 5, 2019), effective March 20, 2019 (noting that the exemption existed prior to the enactment of Section 2-70 of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act and therefore will not sunset with the rest of the act). Into-Plane Fees The taxability of services that transfer prepaid fuel from a fuel seller directly to an airplane, depends on the existence of an inseparable link between the fuel seller and buyer. For instance, if an aircraft owner contracts to buy and have fuel loaded on an aircraft, and the fuel seller selected the person to load the fuel, then there was an inseparable link between the purchase and the delivery of the fuel, and the into-plane fees would be subject to tax. However, if the aircraft owner instructed a fuel seller to use a specific ground-based operator to load fuel, then there is no inseparable link and the into-plane fees would not subject to tax.

Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Aircraft, Interstate and Common Carrier Purchase, Lease, or Rental Transactions

Nontaxable Aircraft used by an interstate carrier for hire as rolling stock moving in interstate commerce are exempt from Illinois retailer's occupation tax, service occupation tax, use tax and service use tax. 35 ILCS 105/3-55(c); 35 ILCS 115/2(d); 35 ILCS 120/2-5(12); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.120(l); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.340(a); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §140.125(s). For aircraft purchased on or after Jan. 1, 2014, “use as rolling stock moving in interstate commerce” occurs when, during a 12-month period, the rolling stock has carried persons or property for hire in interstate commerce for greater than 50 percent of its total trips for that period or for greater than 50 percent of its total miles for that period. 35 ILCS 105/3-61(e); 35 ILCS 110/3-51(e); 35 ILCS 115/2d(e); 35 ILCS 120/2-51(e). The person claiming the exemption shall make an election at the time of purchase to use either the trips or mileage method and document that election in their books and records. If no election is made to use the trips or mileage method, the person shall be deemed to have chosen the mileage method. Flight hours may be used in lieu of recording miles in determining whether the aircraft meets the mileage test. 35 ILCS 105/3-61(e); 35 ILCS 110/3-51(e); 35 ILCS 115/2d(e); 35 ILCS 120/2-51(e).

Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Motor Vehicles, Intrastate or Non-Commercial Use Purchase, Lease, or Rental Transactions

Taxable Generally, Illinois imposes Retailers' Occupation Tax and Use Tax on retail sales of motor vehicles, with the exception of motor vehicles sold to nonresidents. See 35 ILCS 120/14; 35 ILCS 105/1. If the transaction is not a retail sale (e.g., it is a transfer by gift or is a casual or isolated sale), then Illinois imposes Vehicle Use Tax on the transaction. 625 ILCS 5/3-1001. For more information regarding the Vehicle Use Tax, see Excise Taxes Navigator, at Illinois 9.4. Trade-in Credit for Motor Vehicles With respect to trade-in credit on the sale of a motor vehicle subject to Retailers Occupation Tax, the retailer is allowed to accept a trade-in to reduce the taxable selling price. If, however, the motor vehicle is sold for the purpose of leasing it for a defined period of more than one year and the transaction otherwise qualifies to use the “selling price,” then no trade-in credit is allowed. Illinois General Information Letter ST 16-0061-GIL (Nov. 2, 2016); see Illinois General Information Letter ST 18-0008-GIL (March 27, 2018) (trade-in credit also not allowed for sales between private parties); Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0049-GIL (July 30, 2015) (explaining the taxability of the sale or transfer of motor vehicles that are sold in Florida to residents of another state and purchased in another state and brought into Florida); Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0062-GIL (Oct. 26, 2015) (suggesting language stating that the selling price of first division and certain second division motor vehicles sold for the purpose of leasing for more than one year is based on amount of lease contract with no credit for trade-ins); Illinois General Information Letter ST 16-0018-GIL (May 2, 2016). Motor Vehicles Sold to Nonresidents Illinois does not tax sales of motor vehicles to nonresidents if the motor vehicle is not to be titled in Illinois and the purchaser receives either a drive-away permit for the purpose of transporting the vehicle to a destination outside of Illinois or the nonresident purchaser has non-Illinois vehicle registration plates to transfer to the motor vehicle upon transporting the vehicle outside of Illinois. 35 ILCS 120/2-5(25); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 130.605(b). Retailers who make exempt sales of motor vehicles to nonresidents must keep evidence that the purchaser is not a resident of Illinois, the best evidence being a copy of the purchaser's non-Illinois driver's license. Additionally, the retailer must keep a copy of a certification from the purchaser stating, under penalties of perjury and fraud, that he or she is not a resident of Illinois and that he or she will be liable for the tax if the car is used in Illinois for more than 30 days in a calendar year. 35 ILCS 120/2-5(25); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 130.605(b); Illinois Administrative Hearing ST 17-03 (Dec. 28, 2016) (examining the taxpayer's drivers license, vehicle insurance policy, and tax returns to determine their residence; also noting that “resident” is synonymous with “domicile”); Illinois General Information Letter ST 14-0053-GIL (Dec. 29, 2014). Nonresidents that purchase a motor vehicle in Illinois are not liable for use tax if they can demonstrate that the motor vehicle is not to be titled in Illinois, and if a drive-away permit is issued to the motor vehicle or if the nonresident purchaser has vehicle registration plates to transfer to the motor vehicle upon returning to his or her home state. 35 ILCS 105/3-55(h); Illinois Administrative Hearing MV 17-01 (Dec. 28, 2016) (examining the taxpayer's drivers license, utility bills, and tax returns to determine her residence;also noting that “resident” is synonymous with “domicile”). The exemption for sales to nonresidents applies only if the state in which the motor vehicle will be titled allows a reciprocal exemption for a motor vehicle sold and delivered in that state to an Illinois resident, but titled in Illinois. If the state in which the nonresident purchaser lives does not have an equivalent exemption, tax is imposed at the rate of taxation in the state in which the purchaser is a resident, but not to exceed the tax that would otherwise be imposed under the Retailer's Occupation Tax. 35 ILCS 120/2-5(25-5); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 130.605(b). The Department of Revenue maintains a list of reciprocal and non-reciprocal states, and the corresponding tax rates that must be applied to purchases of motor vehicles. The current states required to collect tax are Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, and South Carolina. Illinois Publication January 2019 ST-58. For current rates see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Illinois 5.2.1. Motor Vehicle Leases A person who rents or leases automobiles to others for lease terms of more than one year, is not considered a person engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property to purchasers for use or consumption. Therefore, such lessor is not required to remit retailers' occupation tax on the lease transactions. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2010(b); see also Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0049-GIL (July 30, 2015). However, because the lessor is not reselling the property, he or she is subject to the use tax, as the ultimate user, when purchasing tangible personal property to be rented or leased to others. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2010(b). If a person is engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property and purports to rent or lease such property for a nominal amount (i.e., a dollar or other nominal amount) to a nominal lessee or bailee, the transaction is considered a sale of tangible personal property and such person is liable for the retailers' occupation tax. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2010(a). Illinois does not impose tax on the lessee of a motor vehicle leased for a period of more than one year. Illinois General Information Letter ST 17-0005-GIL (Feb. 9, 2017). However, the lessor and lessee may contractually agree that the lessee will reimburse the lessor for the lessor's use tax cost. Illinois General Information Letter 15-0056-GIL (Aug. 28, 2015) (lessors of motor vehicles for a term of more than one year are deemed end users and are therefore subject to Illinois use tax on the selling price; lessees may be contractually obligated under the lease to reimburse lessors for their tax costs); see Illinois General Information Letter ST 16-0059-GIL (Nov. 2, 2016) (lessor owes use tax on cost of motor vehicle to be leased; lessee likely agreed to reimburse lessor this use tax cost). Where lessees reimburse the lessor for use tax liability as part of a lease agreement of a motor vehicle and then purchase said motor vehicle for fair market value, the retailers' occupation tax is due on the sale of the vehicle to the lessees without a credit for the use tax reimbursement payments. Illinois General Information Letter ST 17-0020-GIL (June 9, 2017). Beginning Jan. 1, 2015, Illinois imposes retailers' occupation tax on a motor vehicle sold for the purpose of being leased for a defined period of longer than one year if the vehicle is: 1) a first-division motor vehicle, i.e., a vehicle that carries not more than 10 people; or 2) a second-division motor vehicle, which are a recreational vehicles (vehicles that provide living quarters with direct walk-through access to the living quarters from the driver's seat), vans that seat 7 to 16 passengers, or vehicles that have a gross weight of 8,000 pounds or less. 35 ILCS 120/1; see 625 ILCS 5/1-146 (defining motor vehicles under the Illinois Vehicle Code). Also effective Jan. 1, 2015, the selling price for a motor vehicle sold for the purpose of leasing for a defined period of more than a year consists of amounts due the lessor from the lessee at signing and the monthly payments charged over the lease term. The selling price also includes charges not calculated at the time the lease is executed, including charges for excess mileage, damages to the vehicle, or wear and tear. Additionally, Illinois does not allow a credit for trade-ins associated with the sale of motor vehicles sold for the purpose of leasing for more than a year. 35 ILCS 120/1, as amended by 2014 Ill. H.B. 5684, effective Aug. 26, 2014; Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0049-GIL (July 30, 2015); see also Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0062-GIL (Oct. 26, 2015) (suggesting language stating that the selling price of first division and certain second division motor vehicles sold for the purpose of leasing for more than one year is based on amount of lease contract with no credit for trade-ins). Thus, if a qualifying motor vehicle is sold to be leased for a defined period that exceeds one year, then the selling price is the amount paid under the lease contract, not the amount that the leasing company pays to purchase the car from the motor vehicle dealer. Illinois General Information Letter ST 18-0008-GIL (March 27, 2018); Illinois General Information Letter ST 16-0061-GIL (Nov. 2, 2016); Illinois General Information Letter 15-0056-GIL (Aug. 28, 2015); Illinois Private Letter Ruling ST 15-0047-GIL (July 23, 2014). Consequently, where the lease contract includes payment terms requiring the lessee to reimburse the lessor for the lessor's use tax cost (as is permitted in Illinois), the amount of the use tax reimbursement is included in the taxable selling price, as such amount is part of the consideration received by the lessor pursuant to the lease contract. Illinois General Information Letter ST 17-0005-GIL (Feb. 9, 2017). On or after, Jan. 1, 2015, if the vehicle is sold when the lease ends, then Illinois does not allow credit for tax paid under the lease. Illinois Informational Bulletin FY 2015-03 (December 2014); see Illinois General Information Letter ST 17-0029-GIL (July 31, 2017). Prior to Jan. 1, 2015, if the vehicle was sold when the lease ended, and the sale was subject to the Retailers'Occupation Tax, the lessor/seller could claim a credit for tax paid under the lease, provided the selling price reported on the return for the original lease transaction was the actual selling price of the item. Illinois Informational Bulletin FY 2015-03 (December 2014); see Illinois General Information Letter ST 16-0059-GIL (Nov. 2, 2016) (lessor/seller may claim a credit for tax previously paid; however, lessee/purchaser may not claim credit because lessee was not liable for tax on the lease transaction; lessee/purchaser is liable for use tax on the sale transaction). If a lease terminates early, then Illinois does not provide a refund. That is because the tax is imposed on the sale of the vehicle to the leasing company, not the lease itself. Illinois General Information Letter 15-0060-GIL (Oct. 20, 2015); Illinois General Information Letter 15-0061-GIL (Oct. 23, 2015) (the Retailers'Occupation Tax does not allow a refund of tax paid on the purchase of a motor vehicle by a leasing company because the lessee moves out of Illinois before the end of the lease term or because the lease contract is terminated early; the tax is imposed on the sale of the vehicle to the leasing company, not on the lease transaction). Illinois treats motor vehicle leases with a defined initial period of greater than one year and an option to renew on a month-to-month basis following this initial defined period in the same way as it treats leases with a term of one year or less, and those leases are subject to Automobile Renting Occupation and Use Tax in lieu of retailers' occupation tax.

Temporary Presence in State Other than sales of motor vehicles to nonresidents(discussed above) and motor vehicles qualifying as exempt rolling stock (discussed in subsection below), Illinois does not have specific provisions discussing motor vehicles temporarily located or used in Illinois. Illinois has a general temporary storage exemption, which provides that use tax does not apply to the temporary storage of tangible personal property that is acquired outside Illinois and that, after being brought into Illinois and stored there temporarily, is used solely outside Illinois or is physically attached to or incorporated into other tangible personal property that is used solely outside Illinois, or is altered by converting, fabricating, manufacturing, printing, processing, or shaping, and, as altered, is used solely outside Illinois. 35 ILCS 105/3-55(e). Returned Vehicle Tax may be refunded if the vehicle manufacture accepts the return of a vehicle and refunds the purchase price to the customer. The retailer must first refund taxes paid to the customer before claiming a refund, however the retailer is not obligated to apply for a refund and the customer may not directly file a claim for credit.

Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Motor Vehicles, Intrastate or Non-Commercial Use Short-term Motor Vehicle Rentals

Depends Persons who rent automobiles for lease terms of one year or less are not subject to use tax on the cost of the vehicles or to Retailers' Occupation Tax on the rental receipts, but are liable for the Automobile Renting Occupation and Use Tax. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2010(c). For additional information about the Illinois Automobile Renting Occupation and Use Tax, see the Excise Tax Navigator, at Illinois 9.2. Thus, gross proceeds received from sales of vehicles to be used for renting for periods of one year or less are exempt from the Retailers' Occupation Tax and use tax. 35 ILCS 120/2-5(5); 35 ILCS 105/3-5(10); see Illinois Private Letter Ruling ST 17-0004-PLR (May 25, 2017) (exemption available for sale-leaseback transaction involving fleet of vehicles for short term rentals that are subject to the Automobile Renting Occupation and Use Tax); see also Illinois General Information Letter ST 17-0029-GIL (July 31, 2017). If a person rents or leases automobiles for lease terms of more than one year, then Illinois does not consider that person to be engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property to purchasers for use. Therefore, the leased automobiles are not subject to retailers' occupation tax. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2010(b); see also Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0049-GIL (July 30, 2015). However, the lessor is the property user, and therefore he or she is subject to the use tax when purchasing tangible personal property to be rented or leased to others. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2010(b); see Illinois General Information Letter 15-0056-GIL (Aug. 28, 2015) (lessors of motor vehicles for a term of more than one year are deemed end users and are therefore subject to Illinois use tax on the selling price; lessees may be contractually obligated under the lease to reimburse lessors for their tax costs). Beginning Jan. 1, 2015, Illinois imposes retailers'occupation tax on leases longer than one year of first-division motor vehicles, or second-division motor vehicles that are recreational vehicles (vehicles that provide living quarters with direct walk-through access to the living quarters from the driver's seat), vans that seat 7 to 16 passengers, or vehicles with a gross weight of 8,000 pounds or less. The selling price is equal to the total paid under the lease contract, instead of the amount the leasing company pays to the dealer to purchase the vehicle. The amount due at signing and the monthly payments are both taxable. For leases to which this treatment applies, Illinois does not give credit for trade-ins. Other charges are also subject to tax (e.g., excess mileage, damages to the vehicle, or wear and tear). However, this treatment does not apply to motor vehicle leases for an undefined term, such as those that provide the option to renew on a month-to-month basis following an initial defined period. 35 ILCS 120/1; Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0049-GIL (July 30, 2015); see also Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0062-GIL (Oct. 26, 2015) (suggesting language stating that the selling price of first division and certain second division motor vehicles sold for the purpose of leasing for more than one year is based on amount of lease contract with no credit for trade-ins). Rented Pickup Trucks or SUVs Beginning Jan. 1, 2014, rentals of pickup trucks or SUVs weighing 8,000 lbs. or less are not subject to the Retailers' Occupation Tax and Use Tax. Instead, Illinois treats those vehicles like cars, subject them to the Automobile Renting Occupation and Use Tax. 35 ILCS 155/2; Illinois Informational Bulletin FY 2014-09 (March 2014). A person who rents or leases automobiles for one year or less incurs neither use tax liability on the vehicle's cost nor retailers' occupation tax liability on rental receipts. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2010(c); see also Illinois Private Letter Ruling ST 15-0047-GIL (July 23, 2015) (Illinois does not impose sales tax on the lease of a motor vehicle for a term of more than one year, as the lessee is determined to be the end user of the property to be leased; however, lessors owe use tax on the selling price of the vehicle and provisions for payment of tax are governed by contractual agreement). However, a person engaged in the business of renting automobiles in Illinois under lease terms of one year or less is subject to the Automobile Renting Occupation and Use Tax Act under 35 ILCS 155/1. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2010(c). Chicago Tax on Short-Term Vehicle Rentals In Hertz Corp. v. Chicago, the Illinois Supreme Court reversed an appellate court ruling and held that Ruling 11, which applied a Chicago city tax on certain motor vehicle rentals, violates the home rule article of the Illinois constitution because it has an extraterritorial effect, and is thus unenforceable. Hertz Corp. v. Chicago, 2017 IL 119945, 2017 BL 16388 (Ill. 2017), reversing Hertz Corp. v. Chicago, 41 N.E.3d 574, 2015 BL 307363 (Ill. App. Ct. 2015) (holding that if the taxable event occurs within the taxing jurisdiction, it is not an extraterritorial exercise of a municipality's home rule powers to impose tax-collection duties on a nonresident entity that does business within the municipality). With respect to short-term vehicle rentals, the Chicago City Comptroller in 2011 promulgated the now unenforceable Ruling 11, which applied tax to car rentals “to Chicago residents, on or after July 1, 2011, from suburban locations within [three] miles of Chicago's border . . . by motor vehicle rental companies doing business in the City.” Chicago, Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax Second Amended Ruling 11; see also Chicago Munic. Code Sec. 3-32-120 (allowing the City Comptroller to issue guidance regarding the city's administrative and enforcement rules). Absent contrary written proof, the City assumed that a lease to a Chicago resident is a lease in which the lessee will use the vehicle in Chicago, whereas a lease to a non-Chicago resident is one in which the lessee will not use the vehicle in Chicago. Chicago, Personal Property Lease Transaction Tax Second Amended Ruling 11. The Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority The Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority is authorized to impose a tax of 6 percent upon the gross receipts of lessors of automobiles derived from their rental within the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority district. 70 ILCS 210/13(d).

If no election is made under this subsection to use the trips or mileage method, the person shall be deemed to have chosen the mileage method. For purposes of determining qualifying trips or miles, motor vehicles that carry persons or property for hire, even just between points in Illinois, will be considered used for hire in interstate commerce if the motor vehicle transports persons whose journeys or property whose shipments originate or terminate outside Illinois.

Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Property and Passenger Transportation Property Transportation, Moving Services

Depends Illinois has not directly addressed moving services by statute. Illinois General Information Letter ST 12-0033-GIL (July 20, 2012). By Information Letter, Illinois has stated that Service Occupation and Use Taxes do not apply to sales of service that do not involve the transfer of tangible personal property to customers. However, if tangible personal property is transferred incident to sales of service, this will result in either Service Occupation Tax liability or Use Tax liability for the servicemen depending upon his activities. Illinois General Information Letter ST 12-0033-GIL (July 20, 2012). However, a retailer making a sale of packaging materials to a moving/van line or a storage company is making a sale of tangible personal property to the end-user of that property. Consequently, the sale is an Illinois retail sale subject to Retailers' Occupation Tax and Use Tax liabilities. Illinois General Information Letter ST 12-0033-GIL (July 20, 2012). The tax liabilities of warehousemen who hold themselves out to the public as being engaged in the business of moving, storing, packing and shipping tangible personal property belonging to other persons are generally engaged in a service transaction, and if no tangible personal property is transferred to the service customer, then no Retailers' Occupation Tax, Use Tax, Service Occupation Tax, or Service Use Tax, is incurred.
