Depends The criteria used to determine whether a sale is one of service or tangible property is based on the value of the service provided in comparison to the value of the property transferred. Measurex Sys., Inc. v. Maine State Tax Assessor, 490 A.2d 1192 (Me. 1985) citing Cmty. Telecasting Serv. v. Johnson, 220 A.2d 500, 503 (Me. 1966). A transaction will be deemed a sale of services rather than goods when:• the creation of property requires high skill and the materials involved are of relatively little value; and • the principal value of the finished product lies in the services to be rendered; and • the product is of little value to anyone other than the buyer. Measurex Sys., Inc. v. Maine State Tax Assessor, 490 A.2d 1192 (Me. 1985) citing Cmty. Telecasting Ser. v. Johnson, 220 A.2d 500, 503 (Me. 1966). The relative dollar value of the service as against that of the product, sometimes expressed in percentages, is significant. Measurex Sys., Inc. v. Maine State Tax Assessor, 490 A.2d 1192 (Me. 1985) citing Cmty. Telecasting Serv. v. Johnson, 220 A.2d 500, 503 (Me. 1966). In Measurex Systems Inc. v. Maine State Tax Assessor, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court held that the taxpayer's burden of proof for establishing that there was the sale of a service instead of tangible personal property had not been met because the computer equipment was not custom software, which would be treated as a service. To be considered a service the property transferred had to require a high degree of skill to create and the tangible property must be of little value to any other buyer. Measurex Sys., Inc. v. Maine State Tax Assessor, 490 A.2d 1192 (Me. 1985). BNA-SUTN ME 9.3.1.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Bundled Transactions

Depends Maine does not statutorily define “bundled” transaction. If labor and tangible personal property are not separately stated, the entire amount charged is subject to sales tax. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1752(14)(B)(4). Nontaxable charges that are aggregated with and not separately stated from taxable mobile telecommunications charges are subject to tax, unless the home service provider can reasonably identify the particular charges from books and records kept in the regular course of its business. A customer is not allowed to rely upon the non-taxability of bundled services unless the customer's home service provider separately states the non-taxable services or the home service provider elects, after receiving written notice from the customer, to provide data based upon the home service provider's books and records that are kept in the regular course of business and that reasonably identify the non-taxable charges. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §2556(4). BNA-SUTN ME 9.3.2.
