Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Tangible Personal Property

Depends In Illinois, sourcing is determined either by agreement of the parties to transaction or by statute. 810 ILCS 5/2-401(2) and (3). Sourcing for tangible personal property is determined either by the parties explicit agreement of what time and place title is to pass or, in the event no agreement has been made, then under 810 ILCS 5/2-401(2) and (3). 810 ILCS 5/2-401(2) and (3). The statute provides:• unless otherwise explicitly agreed, title passes to the buyer at the time and place at which the seller completes his performance with reference to the physical delivery of the goods, despite any reservation of a security interest and even though a document of title is to be delivered at a different time or place; and in particular and despite any reservation of a security interest by the bill of lading: o if the contract requires or authorizes the seller to send the goods to the buyer but does not require him to deliver them at the destination, title passes to the buyer at the time and place of shipment; and o if the contract requires delivery at destination, title passes on tender there. • unless otherwise explicitly agreed, where delivery is to be made without moving the goods, o if the seller is to deliver a document of title, title passes at the time when and the place where he delivers such documents; or o if the goods are at the time of the contracting already identified and no documents are to be delivered, title passes at the time and place of contracting. 810 ILCS 5/2-401(2) and (3). Title passes from a seller to a purchaser in any manner and with any conditions explicitly agreed upon by the parties. Treating the actual transfer of the property as the taxable sales event gives the parties to the transaction considerable flexibility in fixing the time and place of sale. Property transferred while title remains with the seller as a security interest is still deemed to be a sale at retail. 810 ILCS 5/2-401. Sales of Property Originating in Illinois If a seller makes a retail sale of tangible personal property located in Illinois that is then delivered in Illinois to the purchaser (or a representative of the purchaser), then the sale is taxable to the seller. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.605(a). Three exceptions to this general rule are permitted under the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act. The first exception applies to sales made to common carriers. If a common carrier by rail or motor purchases and takes actual possession of tangible personal property in Illinois but transports that property out of Illinois for use outside Illinois, such property will be deemed to be in interstate commerce and hence exempted from both the retailers'occupation tax and any local retailers' occupation tax. 35 ILCS 120/2-5(17); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.605(b)(3). Under the second exception, tax also does not extend to property that the seller is obligated to deliver to some point outside Illinois, either itself or by carrier, not to be returned to a point within Illinois. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.605(c); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.605(d); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §140.501(b); see also Union Electric v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 136 Ill. 2d 385, 556 N.E.2d 236 (Ill. 1990); Illinois General Information Letter ST 17-0015-GIL (May 31, 2017). The point of title passage is irrelevant in determining the applicability of this exception. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.605(a)(3); see Illinois Private Letter Ruling ST 15-0014-PLR (Oct. 23, 2015) (sale of wine with title passing to purchasers in Illinois not subject to tax when delivered to locations out-of-state, not to be returned to Illinois). Sellers are required to retain records that show there was an agreement and a bona fide delivery outside the state. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.605(f); Illinois Administrative Hearing ST 15-15 (Sept. 15, 2015) (where taxpayer did not maintain records demonstrating that delivery occurred outside of Illinois, taxpayer was not entitled to the interstate commerce exemption from tax). If the property is shipped via common carrier, a waybill or bill of lading requiring delivery outside the state are sufficient records. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.605(f)(1). The seller should be reflected as the consignor or shipper on any bill of lading. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.605(d). If the property is sent by mail, the seller is required to retain an authorized receipt that includes the name of the addressee, the date of mailing, and the address outside the state where the property is delivered. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.605(f)(2). Sellers that deliver the property outside the state in their own vehicles are required to retain a trip sheet signed by the driver that includes the address for delivery and the name and signature of the person to whom the goods were delivered or an affidavit from the purchaser attesting to the name and address of the seller, the name and address of the purchaser and the time and place of the delivery of the property outside of Illinois. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.605(f)(3). The third exception concerns motor vehicles purchased by and delivered to a nonresident in Illinois. If such a vehicle is not to be titled in Illinois and a “drive away” decal permit is issued in connection with such motor vehicle, 625 ILCS 5/3-603. or if the nonresident purchaser has plates from his home state to place on the vehicle upon returning home, the transaction is not subject to the retailers' occupation tax. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 130.605(b)(1). Issuance of a drive away decal permit is considered prima facie evidence that the vehicle is not to be titled in Illinois. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 130.605(b)(1). Retailers who make exempt sales of motor vehicles to nonresidents must keep evidence that the purchaser is not a resident of Illinois, the best evidence being a copy of the purchaser's non-Illinois driver's license. Additionally, the retailer must keep a copy of a certification from the purchaser stating, under penalties of perjury, that he or she is not a resident of Illinois that he or she will be liable for the tax if the car is used in Illinois for more than 30 days in a calendar year. 35 ILCS 120/2-5(25),(25-5); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 130.605(b). The exemption for sales to nonresidents applies only if the state in which the motor vehicle will be titled allows a reciprocal exemption for a motor vehicle sold and delivered in that state to an Illinois resident, but titled in Illinois. If the state in which the nonresident purchaser lives does not have an equivalent exemption, tax is imposed at the rate of taxation in the state in which the purchaser is a resident, but not to exceed the tax that would otherwise be imposed under the Retailer's Occupation Tax. 35 ILCS 120/2-5(25),(25-5); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 130.605(b). The Department of Revenue maintains a list of reciprocal and non-reciprocal states, and the corresponding tax rates that must be applied to purchases of motor vehicles. The current states required to collect tax are Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, and South Carolina. Illinois Publication January 2019 ST-58. For current rates see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Illinois 5.1.2. Property Delivered to Illinois by a Registered Out-Of-State Retailer When charges for outgoing transportation and delivery are separately identified on an invoice, and the purchaser has the option to pick up the tangible personal property, outgoing transportation and delivery is considered a service separate and distinct from the sale of tangible personal property. Charges for such services should be excluded from the gross receipts subject to the Retailers’Occupation Tax. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.415(b); Illinois Private Letter Ruling ST 15-0012-PLR (July 27, 2015). BNA-SUTN IL 4.1.1.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Services

Depends Sourcing for Service Occupation Tax is generally where the selling of the service takes place. 810 ILCS 5/2-401(2) and (3); Illinois General Information Letter ST 18-0018-GIL (July 13, 2018); Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0001-GIL (Jan. 7, 2015); Illinois General Information Letter ST 06-0179-GIL (Aug. 23, 2006). Retailers' Occupation Tax is not generally imposed on the sale of services, however, the Service Occupation Tax and Service Use Tax are imposed on service providers for tangible property transferred in connection with a sale of services by persons engaged in the business of making sales of service. 35 ILCS 115/3 BNA-SUTN IL 4.1.2.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Leases and Rentals

Depends Leases with the option to purchase, otherwise known as conditional sales, are sourced to the location where the property is first delivered to the lessee or bailee for its intended use. 35 ILCS 120/2-12(5), as amended by 2015 Ill. S.B. 1548, effective July 23, 2015. In the case of property that is titled or registered with a state agency, such as a boat, an airplane, or an automobile, the appropriate taxing jurisdiction for local use tax purposes is the address at which the boat, airplane, or automobile is titled or registered. 65 ILCS 5/8-11-6(a). BNA-SUTN IL 4.1.3.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Local Sourcing

Depends Receipts from a sale are subject to local retailers' occupation tax in the locality where the seller's “predominant and most important”activities related to the sale take place. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 270.115(b)(5); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 693.115(b)(5); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 320.115(b)(5); Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0001-GIL (Jan. 7, 2015). Formerly, the situs of a sale for purposes of the local retailers' occupation taxes was generally the locality where the seller accepted a purchaser's order. This practice allowed companies based in locations with high local taxes to set up remote offices in lower taxed localities where the orders would be accepted. However, following the decision in Hartney Fuel Oil Co. v. Hamer, this lone factor for determining the situs was abandoned in favor of a fact-intensive inquiry that examines multiple activities of a business to determine local tax liability. In Hartney, the company primarily operated out of offices in Cook County, however, orders were accepted in a small office 100 miles away in rural Illinois that had no local tax on the transactions. According to Illinois' local sourcing regulations in effect at the time, the company's sales should have been sourced to the locality in which the orders were accepted. The Illinois Supreme Court disagreed, holding that because the retailers' occupation tax is imposed on the business of selling and not on individual sale transactions, receipts from the company's sales should be sourced to the locality where the bulk of its sales activities occurred, not where orders were accepted. For the same reason, Illinois' contrary local sourcing regulations were invalid. Hartney Fuel Oil Co. v. Hamer, 998 N.E.2d 1227 (2013). In response to the court's ruling in Hartney, the Illinois Department of Revenue amended its local sourcing regulations. Under the amended regulations, receipts from a sale are subject to local retailers'occupation tax in the locality where the seller's “predominant and most important” activities related to the sale take place. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 270.115(b)(5); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 693.115(b)(5); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 320.115(b)(5); Illinois Private Letter Ruling ST 16-0013-PLR (Oct. 6, 2016); Illinois Private Letter Ruling ST 16-0012-PLR (Sept. 26, 2016); Illinois Private Letter Ruling ST 16-0007-PLR (July 29, 2016); Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0001-GIL (Jan. 7, 2015). See Illinois General Information Letter ST 17-0015-GIL (May 31, 2017) (local sourcing determination is a fact-specific inquiry). In making this determination, the following “primary selling activities” must be considered:• the location of sales personnel authorized to solicit customers and bind the seller; • the location where the sale terms are agreed upon; • the location where payment is received and from which invoices are issued; • the location of inventory; and • the location of the seller's headquarters, that is, the principal place from which the business of selling is directed and managed. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 270.115(c)(1); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 693.115(c)(1); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 320.115(c)(1); Illinois Private Letter Ruling ST 18-0011-PLR (Sept. 28, 2018); Illinois Private Letter Ruling ST 16-0013-PLR (Oct. 6, 2016); Illinois Private Letter Ruling ST 16-0012-PLR (Sept. 26, 2016); Illinois Private Letter Ruling ST 16-0007-PLR (July 29, 2016). If any three or more of the above factors favors a particular location, the sale will be sourced to that location. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 270.115(c)(2); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 693.115(c)(2); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 320.115(c)(2); Illinois Private Letter Ruling ST 15-0005-PLR (Sept. 26, 2015); Illinois Private Letter Ruling ST 15-0005-PLR (Jan. 21, 2015); Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0004-PLR (Jan. 21, 2015). If no more than two of the “primary selling activities” favors sourcing a sale to a particular location, the following secondary factors will be considered:• the location where marketing and solicitation occur; • the location where the seller engages in activities necessary to procure goods for sale; • the location of the seller's officers, executives or employees authorized to set prices or determine other terms of sale; • the location where purchase orders or other contractual documents are received, if purchase orders are accepted, processed, or fulfilled in a location other than that at which they are received; • the location where title to property sold passes; and • the location where the seller displays goods to prospective customers. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 270.115(c)(4); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 693.115(c)(4); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 320.115(c)(4); Illinois Private Letter Ruling ST 17-0005-PLR (June 14, 2017) (where one of the primary factors and three secondary factors occur at a company's headquarters and only one of the primary factors and one of the secondary factor occur at the location of the company's inventory, sales should be sourced to the company's headquarters). If any three or more of these factors favors a particular location, the sale will be sourced to that location. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 270.115(c)(2); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 693.115(c)(2); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 320.115(c)(2). The regulations also apply specific sourcing rules to certain transactions. For instance, in the case of typical over-the-counter sales at “brick-and-mortar” retail locations, the sale is sourced to the seller's retail location where a customer, physically present, agrees to purchase and pays for an item of merchandise. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 270.115(c)(3)(A); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 693.115(c)(3)(A); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 320.115(c)(3)(A); Illinois Private Letter Ruling ST 17-0005-PLR (June 14, 2017) (where a customer places an order at a brick and mortar store on credit, that sale should still be treated as an “over the counter sale,” because the customer agrees at the time of sale to make payment, albeit at a later date); Illinois Private Letter Ruling ST 15-0005-PLR (Jan. 21, 2015) (all of company's over-the-counter sales are to be sourced to the location of that sale, including where purchases are filled from inventory from other locations or items are drop shipped from a manufacturer). For sales that are placed over the internet, if the tangible personal property that is sold is delivered from an inventory in Illinois, the sale should be sourced to the location of the inventory. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 270.115(c)(3); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 693.115(c)(3); Illinois Private Letter Ruling ST 17-0005-PLR (June 14, 2017). Leases with the option to purchase, otherwise known as conditional sales, are sourced to the location where the property is located at the time the parties enter into the agreement. Illinois General Information Letter ST 14-0050-GIL (Oct. 31, 2014). In the case of property that is titled or registered with a state agency, such as a boat, an airplane, or an automobile, the appropriate taxing jurisdiction for local use tax purposes is the address at which the boat, airplane, or automobile is titled or registered. 65 ILCS 5/8-11-6(a). In the recent Illinois Supreme Court decision of Hertz Corp. v. Chicago, the judiciary found that Chicago's Rule 11 had an unconstitutional extraterritorial effect because it violated the home rule article of the Illinois constitution. Hertz Corp. v. Chicago, 2017 IL 119945, 2017 BL 16388 (Ill. 2017). Rule 11 applied to vehicle rental companies that were doing business in the Chicago, defined as having a rental location in the Chicago or regularly renting vehicles that are used in the City, such that the company was subject to audit by the department. Hertz Corp. v. Chicago, 2017 IL 119945, 2017 BL 16388 (Ill. 2017). Ruling 11 advised vehicle rental companies doing business in the Chicago, that when renting from a suburban location within three miles of Chicago's borders to a customer who will use the vehicle in the Chicago, to maintain written records that support any claim of exemption from the tax, for the company's use in the event of an audit. In such an event, the ruling states, absent written proof to the contrary, the department will assume that a customer who is a Chicago resident, based upon the customer's driver's license, will use the vehicle in the City and is thus subject to the tax. Conversely, the ruling further states that the department will assume that a customer who is not a Chicago resident will use the vehicle primarily outside the City and thus be exempt from the tax. Hertz Corp. v. Chicago, 2017 IL 119945, 2017 BL 16388 (Ill. 2017). The Supreme Court found that Rule 11 was unconstitutional because the City's use tax was imposed not on the actual use within the City's borders but on the lessee's stated intent to use the property in Chicago or, failing any statement of intent, on presumed use based upon the lessee's residence address. Hertz Corp. v. Chicago, 2017 IL 119945, 2017 BL 16388 (Ill. 2017). Accordingly, the court held that Ruling 11 violated the home rule article of the Illinois constitution because it has an extraterritorial effect and is therefore an improper exercise of the City's home rule powers. Hertz Corp. v. Chicago, 2017 IL 119945, 2017 BL 16388 (Ill. 2017). BNA-SUTN IL 4.1.4.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Credit for Tax Paid to Another Jurisdiction

Yes Illinois allows a use tax credit up to the amount of any sales or use tax paid to another state or the District of Columbia. Illinois does not require that the other jurisdiction provide a similar credit. 35 ILCS 105/3-55(d); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 150.310(a)(3). Where a lessee moves into Illinois during the term of a vehicle lease that exceeds one year with a vehicle he or she originally leased and registered in another state, Illinois law allows for a credit for tax that was properly due and paid in that other state against the use tax owed in Illinois. Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0061-GIL (Oct. 23, 2015); see Illinois General Information Letter ST 17-0002-GIL (Jan. 19, 2017). BNA-SUTN IL 4.2.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Temporary Presence, In-Transit Property Tangible Personal Property First Used Out-of-state

Taxable Whether tangible personal property first used out-of-state is taxable depends on whether it was acquired by an out-of-state resident and used outside of Illinois for at least 3 months before being brought into Illinois. 35 ILCS 105/10; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §150.315; Illinois General Information Letter ST 17-0009-GIL (March 15, 2017). Property purchased by a nonresident and used for at least 3 months outside Illinois is not subject to Use Tax. 35 ILCS 105/10; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §150.315; Illinois General Information Letter ST 17-0009-GIL (March 15, 2017). Effective July 1, 2016, Illinois retailers are no longer able to make tax free purchases of tangible personal property with their expanded temporary storage permits. Illinois Informational Bulletin FY 2016-12. Prior to July 1, 2016, Illinois offered the temporary storage exemption for tangible personal property purchased from Illinois retailers by a taxpayer engaged in centralized purchasing. “Centralized purchasing” refers to the procurement of tangible personal property by persons who purchase tangible personal property in Illinois and who temporarily store that tangible personal property in Illinois prior to transporting it outside the State for use or consumption solely outside the Illinois. 35 ILCS 105/3-55(j). Illinois still offers an exemption for the temporary storage of tangible personal property in Illinois acquired out-of-state if, following its temporary storage within Illinois, the property is: (1) used solely out-of-state; (2)physically attached to or incorporated into other tangible personal property that is used solely out-of-state; or (3) altered by converting, fabricating, manufacturing, printing, processing, or shaping, and as altered, is used solely out-of-state. 35 ILCS 105/3-55(e); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §150.310(a)(6); Illinois Informational Bulletin FY 2016-12; Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0016-PLR (Nov. 13, 2015). But see Illinois Administrative Hearing UT 16-06 (Jan. 6, 2016)(taxpayer owed use tax on motor home purchased outside Illinois because he failed to rebut the department's claim that he used it in Illinois); Illinois Administrative Hearing UT 15-04 (April 1, 2015) (taxpayer's storage of a motor home and vehicle in Illinois constituted a taxable use because the taxpayer failed to show that the items were ever removed from storage in Illinois for use out-of-state). Property that is temporarily stored in the state but later re-enters state, even if just for further storage, fails to meet the “used solely outside of Illinois” requirement. Shared Imaging, LLC v. Hamer, 2017 BL 224261, 2017 IL App (1st) 152817 (Ill. App. Ct., 1st Dist. 2017) (holding that storage qualifies as “use”). The temporary presence exemption from use tax does not apply to property sold within Illinois whether or not the property subsequently leaves Illinois. Where tangible personal property is located in Illinois at the time of the sale and then delivered to the purchaser within Illinois, the sale is subject to tax.
