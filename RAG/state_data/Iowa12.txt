Full Member Iowa is a full member of the Streamlined Sales Tax Project. 2003 Iowa H.F. 683, §94 et seq., effective July 1, 2004. Iowa became a full member of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement on Oct. 1, 2005. 2003 Iowa H.F. 683; Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Certificate of Compliance, Iowa (version 2018.1); Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Important Documents, Iowa. Iowa relieves sellers and certified service providers from tax liability to Iowa and its local jurisdictions for having charged and collected the incorrect amount of sales and use tax resulting from the seller or certified service provider relying on erroneous data in the Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board Taxability Matrix for Iowa. Iowa Code Ann. §423.52(3)(b); Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-240.6. When Iowa changes its tax administration practice section of the taxability matrix, Iowa provides sellers and certified service providers with liability relief for the tax, interest, and penalties for having charged and collected the incorrect tax. This relief is allowed until the first day of the calendar month that is at least 30 days after notice of the change to the taxability matrix for Iowa is submitted to the governing board, provided the seller or certified service provider relied on the prior version of the taxability matrix. Iowa Code Ann. §423.52(3)(b); Iowa Code Ann. §423.52, as amended by 2015 Iowa H.F. 621, effective July 1, 2015; Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Taxability Matrix, Iowa (version 2018.1). In what appears to be a case of first impression for Iowa, the state supreme court held in Bass v. J.C. Penney Co., Iowa's version of the SSUTA does not allow a purchaser a private cause of action against a retailer for alleged wrongful collection of sales tax on shipping and handling charges. Bass v. J.C. Penney Co., 2016 BL 185280, No. 15-0334, (Iowa 2016). See Iowa Code Ann. §423.7, et seq., (Uniform Sales and Use Tax Administration Act). The appellant, Emily Bass, placed two orders, one in April 2013 and one in August 2013, through J.C. Penney's website and was charged sales tax on the shipping and handling charges each time. J.C. Penney seems to have stated the “transportation and handling” charges as single items on its bills. After the first order, Ms. Bass wrote to the retailer requesting a refund and demanding that J.C. Penney cease collecting tax on shipping and handling charges for Iowa sales. The company refunded the tax to Ms. Bass. Shortly after the second internet order, Ms. Bass filed a class action suit, seeking to enjoin J.C. Penney from collecting tax on the shipping and handling charges, claiming that the collection of tax was wrongful under Iowa's version of the SSUTA, and making a negligence claim (a claim subsequently changed to negligent misrepresentation, and amended to include fraud, unjust enrichment, and conversion). The company thereafter remitted to the department all tax collected for the month of August 2013. Two years before Ms. Bass placed her first order in dispute, Kathleen Bottaro wrote the company stating that she had been charged sales tax improperly on shipping, handling, and delivery charges and sought reimbursement. J.C. Penney tax specialist, Carol Danforth, checked with the Iowa Department of Revenue several times about the propriety of the tax on shipping charges. The company ultimately refunded Ms. Bottaro's tax, although the tax issue seemed to remain uncertain. Bass v. J.C. Penney Co., 2016 BL 185280, No. 15-0334, (Iowa 2016). The Iowa Supreme Court, in upholding the lower court's decisions, determined that Ms. Bass had no private right of action under Iowa's SSUTA (the “Uniform Sales and Use Tax Administration Act”), because the act was designed not to create a “new statutory remedy” for taxpayers, but rather to simplify and modernize the sales and use tax in order to ease the tax collection burden on retailers seeking to comply with sales tax requirements. The court held that the legislative purpose of simplification and modernization negated appellant's argument that the language in Iowa Code Ann. §423.45(2) created a private cause of action. The court stated that the statutory language, which requires 60 days notice to a retailer before a cause of action may be brought, is used to alert the retailer in the event that a cause of action otherwise exists under law. The court further concluded that the language was intended to limit claims against retailers, which is consistent with the legislative purpose of simplification. The court also upheld the dismissal of Bass's non-SSUTA claims of negligent misrepresentation, fraud, unjust enrichment, and conversion. Bass v. J.C. Penney Co., 2016 BL 185280, No. 15-0334, (Iowa 2016). BNA-SUTN IA 2.1.1.
