Applications must be on a form prescribed by the department and such an organization must include copies of:• its by laws; • its articles of incorporation; • financial information that provides verifiable sources of income and expenditures, which may include, without limitation, financial statements and independent audit reports; • letters of exemption issued to it by any governmental agency; • if the application is for a charitable organization, an outline of its charitable activities, fund raisers and goals, and a copy of its business or strategic plan must be attached; and • any other information that the department deems relevant. Nev. Admin. Code ch. 372, §372.700(1). The organization must notify the department of changes to the name, address, telephone number or responsible person of the organization. Nev. Admin. Code ch. 372, §372.700(2). The department may deny an application for exemption if it finds that:• the organization has failed to submit sufficient information on which to grant an exemption; or • the organization does not meet the standards for exemption. Nev. Admin. Code ch. 372, §372.700(3). The department may withdraw the letter of exemption issued to any organization if the department finds that:• the organization is no longer engaged in charitable, religious or educational pursuits; • the organization has ceased to comply with the standards for exemption; or • the application contained false or misleading information. Nev. Admin. Code ch. 372, §372.700(4). Other than the provisions pertaining to exemption status for charitable, religious, or educational organizations, the Nevada Tax Code does not directly deal with exemption certificates for general use. However, if a purchaser certifies in writing to a seller that the property purchased will be used in a manner or for a purpose entitling the seller to regard the gross receipts from the sale as exempt from the sales and use tax computation and thereafter the purchaser uses the property for a non-exempt use, the purchaser is then liable for payment as if he were the retailer. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.350. This provision relieves the seller of his obligation to collect the sales and seems to implicitly allow homemade exemption certificates. BNA-SUTN NV 31.8.8.

Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.735(1). Every seller, retailer or person who files the returns required by law must keep the records for at least four years from their making unless the department authorizes their destruction, in writing, at an earlier date. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.735(2). Sellers, retailers or persons who fail to file returns required by law must keep the records for at least eight years from their making unless the department in authorizes their destruction, in writing, at an earlier date. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.735(3). The following records are the minimum that should be retained by business:• Sales journals: this is an accounting device that records the monthly sales. It should be supported by individual sales invoices that show all parts of the sales transaction. Sales invoices should be pre-numbered and issued in sequential order. All documents used to file the monthly/quarterly sales and use tax returns should be kept together. • Purchase journal/cash disbursements journal: This is a listing of all items the business purchases whether for inventory, assets or operating expenses. The journal is supported by paid vendor invoices, which are usually filed in alphabetic order by the vendor name. • Payroll journal: This is a detailed listing of each employee's pay history and is required for all payroll-related taxes. Records regarding healthcare benefit payments made on behalf of the employees by the business should be available for the Modified Business Tax portion of the audit. Also, all Employment Security Division Reports (form NUCS 4072) should be available for the entire audit period. • Bank records should include a check register, deposit receipt, bank statements, bank reconciliations, and, if available, cancelled checks. Business checks should be issued in sequential order; • Monthly, quarterly and annual tax returns for state and local taxing authorities should be supported by all working papers and details related to filing returns. • Accounting records can be completed in-house or by a bookkeeping/accounting service. If an outside service is used, basic journals and ledgers should be provided in order to review the business's financial history. As the business grows, the accounting structure should be routinely re-evaluated. If records are maintained in a computer system, they should be complete and timely, so that they may be used in the audit process. A backup of computer records is also recommended, as it could be helpful in the audit process. Nevada Tax Notes, No. 156 (Oct. 2006). BNA-SUTN NV 31.9.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Refunds

Both Both purchasers and vendors may apply for refunds; however purchasers must reimburse vendors for the amount of sales tax imposed before applying for a refund. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.640. Claims for credits or refunds must be filed with the Department of Taxation within three years after the last day of the month following the close of the period for which any the overpayment was made. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.635. If the Department of Taxation determines any amount of taxes, penalties or interest have been paid more than once or have been illegally or erroneously collected or computed, the department must make that fact known in their records and will certify that fact to the State Board of Examiners. If approved by the Board of Examiners, the excess amount collected or paid must be refunded to the person, or his successors, administrators or executors. However, if the person currently has any outstanding amounts due to the Department of Taxation, the amount to be refunded will instead be treated as a credit against the amounts. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.630. If a taxpayer discovers that it has paid Nevada sales tax to its vendor in error, the taxpayer must contact its vendor and request a refund. A taxpayer who has overcharged sales tax to its customer and already paid that tax to the department must refund the tax to its customer before it can receive a refund from the department. A retailer may request a refund from the department through amended sales tax returns stating clearly the reason for the request, and providing proof that a refund or credit has been given to its customer who was overcharged. The person requesting the refund or credit must be the person who was legally obligated to remit the tax to the department. Nevada Tax Notes October 2014. Every claim for credit or refund must be in writing and must state the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.645. If the department disallows a claim for credit or refund, it must give notice of its action within 30 days after the disallowance. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.655. However, if the department determines that any overpayment has been made intentionally or by reason of carelessness, it may not allow interest on it. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360.2937; Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.660; Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.665.
