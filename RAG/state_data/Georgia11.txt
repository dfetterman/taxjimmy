Yes Use tax is imposed on certain services and tangible personal property purchased outside of Georgia for use and consumption within Georgia. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-34(b). Upon the first instance of use, consumption, distribution, or storage of tangible personal property within Georgia, the owner or user of the property is deemed to be a “dealer” and is liable for tax on the total purchase price. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-30(c)(1); Georgia Policy Statement No. SUT 2011-05-25. If, however, the property is purchased out-of-state and is used outside Georgia for more than six months prior to its first use within Georgia, then the owner or user of the property is only liable for the tax on the lesser of either the purchase price or the fair market value. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-30(c)(2). BNA-SUTN GA 1.1.2.

H.B. 930, effective Jan. 1, 2019. Generally, the Georgia State Revenue Commissioner collects and administers the local sales and use taxes in the same manner as the state sales and use taxes. However, the local taxes are applicable to sales of motor fuels, except for the special district transportation sales and use tax, which does not apply to the sales of certain fuels and energy. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-87; Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-241(d). The same procedures and penalties applicable to the state sales and use taxes also apply to the local sales and use taxes; provided however, that all money collected will be applied first to the taxpayer's liability for taxes owed to the state. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-87; Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-246. Dealers collecting the tax are permitted to claim a percentage of the amount of tax due as compensation in the form of a deduction. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-87; Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-246. The allowable percentage is the same permitted by state sales tax: generally, 3 percent of the first $3,000 of the combined total of all sales and use taxes reported and 0.5 percent of the portion exceeding $3,000. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-50(b). Joint County and Municipal Sales and Use Tax Georgia has created 159 special districts within the state. The geographical boundary of each special district corresponds to and is conterminous with the geographical boundary of each county. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-81; Turner Cnty. v. City of Ashburn, 2013 BL 274178, 293 Ga. 739, 749 S.E.2d 685 (Ga. 2013) (in 2010 laws governing special district taxation were amended to allow judicial resolution of conflicts regarding the allocation and distribution of tax proceeds; this was stricken in Turner by the Supreme Court, which deemed the amendment unconstitutional). Upon voter approval, a county which has a geographical boundary that is conterminous with a special district and each qualified municipality located within the county may impose a joint sales and use tax at the rate of 1 percent. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-82. A qualified municipality is defined as an incorporated municipality which imposes a tax, other than the joint sales and use tax, and provides at least three of the following services:• water; • sewage; • garbage collection; • police protection; • fire protection; or • library. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-80. To impose the tax, the governing authority of any county must submit a resolution to the election superintendent of the county to call for a referendum election. The election superintendent must set the date of the election not less than 30 and not more than 45 days after the call. If more than 50 percent of the votes cast are in favor of the tax, the tax will be levied. If the tax is not approved, the imposition of the tax may not be submitted as an option to the voters again for 24 months. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-85. Once passed, the tax is effective on the first day of the next succeeding calendar quarter, which begins more than 80 days after the adoption of the resolution. However, for services which are regularly billed on a monthly basis, the tax becomes effective with the first regular billing period coinciding with or following the effective date of the resolution. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-86. If the tax was levied prior to June 4, 2010 without the filing of a distribution certificate, then the tax will continue to be valid so long as a distribution certificate was properly filed between June 4, 2010 and October 18, 2013. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-83.1, as added by 2014 Ga. H.B. 719, effective July 1, 2014. County Special Purpose Sales and Use Taxes Upon voter approval, a county may impose a special 1 percent sales and use tax. The proceeds of the tax are to be used for capital outlay projects located within the county. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-110.1; Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-111. Examples of these projects include the construction of and improvements to roads, sidewalks, courthouses, correctional institutions, or other public facilities. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-111(a)(1). The tax may be imposed for a period not to exceed five years. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-111(a)(2). Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) Tax Upon voter approval, the following counties and the city of Atlanta are authorized to impose a sales and use tax at the rate of 1 percent:• Fulton; • DeKalb; • Cobb; • Clayton;and • Gwinnett. MARTA Act of 1965, as amended in 2006, as amended by 2015 Ga. H.B. 213, effective May 5, 2015; see generally Fulton County Code of Ordinances, Part II, ch. 74, Art. II, §74-31 - 74-34. The rate of 1 percent is effective through June 2057, after which the rate will decrease to 0.5 percent. MARTA Act of 1965, as amended in 2006, as amended by 2015 Ga. H.B. 213, effective May 5, 2015. Homestead Option Sales and Use Tax Upon voter approval, a county may impose a sales and use tax for the purpose of funding capital outlay projects and services equal to the revenue lost to the homestead exemption under Section 48-8-104. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-102(b); Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-3(57). The tax is applicable to the same items which are taxable under the state Sales and Use Tax Act, except for motor fuels, food, and food ingredients which are taxable at the local level but not at the state level. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-102(b). Equalized Homestead Option Sales and Use Tax In any county wherein a homestead option sales and use tax is being levied, a county may call an election to submit to voters the question of whether to suspend the existing homestead option sales and use tax and replace it with the equalized homestead option sales and use tax for the purpose of rolling back or eliminating the millage rates for county and municipal ad valorem property tax on homestead properties. For the tax to be implemented, voters would have to answer yes to the aforementioned question as well as to the question of whether to approve a special purpose local option sales and use tax. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-109.1 to Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-109.10, enacted by 2015 Ga. H.B. 215, effective May 4, 2015. Sales Tax for Educational Purposes A county school board or board of education may impose a sales and use tax at the rate of 1 percent for educational purposes. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-141.

The amounts and rates of penalties and interest for the Educational Local Option Tax are identical to the penalties imposed under the state Sales and Use Tax Act. Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-7-.08. Special District Mass Transportation Sales and Use Tax Georgia authorizes its counties to impose within special districts, for a limited period of time, a transportation special purpose local option sales and use tax, the proceeds of which must be used for transportation purposes. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-260, et seq., as amended by 2017 Ga. H.B. 134, effective May 1, 2017. A county may impose such tax provided the county:• is not located in a special district already imposing a special sales and use tax under Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-240, et seq.; • is not defined as a metropolitan county special district governed by the special district sales and use tax election provisions under Ga.

Code Ann. §48-8-110, et seq.; 2) a local constitutional amendment for purposes of a metropolitan area system of public transportation; or 3) under Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-96, relating to taxation of property in consolidated governments. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-261,as amended by 2017 Ga. H.B. 134, §2, effective May 1, 2017; Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-264,as amended by 2017 Ga. H.B. 134, §5, effective May 1, 2017.

Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-241(d), as amended by 2018 Ga. H.B. 5EX, effective Dec. 1, 2018 (repealing limitations on jet fuel exemptions to certain qualifying airlines and airports). Effective Jan. 1, 2013, the TSPLOST is only imposed on the first $5,000 of any transaction involving the sale or lease of a motor vehicle. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-241. This limitation also applies to towable trailers. Georgia Letter Ruling SUT-2017-17 Motor Vehicle (June 12, 2013). The TSPLOST is applicable to the sale of food and beverages as provided for in Ga.

Georgia Letter Ruling SUT-2013-06-12-01 Leases (June 12, 2013). When a lease originates in a non-TSPLOST county and subsequently the lessee moves into and registers the vehicle in a TSPLOST county, the TSPLOST will be due on each lease payment until the $50 maximum is satisfied.

Defined Georgia defines the term “sale” as any transfer of title, possession, exchange, barter, lease, or rental (conditional or otherwise) in any manner or by any means of any kind of tangible personal property for a consideration. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-2(33)(A). A “sale” also includes:• the fabrication of tangible personal property for consumers who directly or indirectly furnish the materials used in such fabrication; • the furnishing, repairing, or serving for a consideration of any tangible personal property consumed on the premises of the person furnishing, repairing, or serving the tangible personal property; or • a transaction by which the possession of property is transferred but the seller retains title as security for the payment of the price. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-2(33)(A). In Georgia Letter Ruling SUT 2014-15, an information technology services company provided server and storage management services for a client. The agreement provided that the IT company would provide all relevant equipment at its own expense and would charge the client a monthly service fee. Also, the agreement provided that the client could cause the IT company to assign to it the technology resources'titles. Lastly, the agreement provided that if it were to terminate in a manner requiring the client to pay “contractual asset charges,”then the IT company would assign ownership of all equipment to the client. The IT company asked the Department of Revenue whether the contractual asset charges would be subject to sales tax. The department responded that no, the contractual asset charges would not be subject to sales tax, because they do not rise to the level of a “sale.”That is to say, the customer does not receive title and at no time has any right of possession or control of the tangible personal property for which the charge is made.
