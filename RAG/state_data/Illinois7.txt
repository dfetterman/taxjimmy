State: Illinois



Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Food and Food Ingredients General Rule

Taxable Illinois imposes tax on food sold for human consumption. The food is taxable at the full 6.25-percent state tax rate if it is “prepared for immediate consumption.” 35 ILCS 105/3-10; 35 ILCS 110/3-10; 35 ILCS 115/3-10; 35 ILCS 120/2-10; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 140.126(a). However, if the food is prepared for consumption off the premises where it is sold, then it is taxable at a reduced state rate of 1 percent. 35 ILCS 105/3-10; 35 ILCS 110/3-10; 35 ILCS 115/3-10; 35 ILCS 120/2-10; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 140.126(a). One must consider two factors to determine whether food is taxed at the higher or lower rate. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.310(b); see also Illinois General Information Letter ST 11-0109-GIL (Dec. 29, 2011). The first factor is whether the retailer has premises at which consumers can eat the food. If it does, then there is a rebuttable presumption that all food the retailer sells is prepared for immediate consumption and subject to tax at the higher rate. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.310(b)(1). However, the retailer can rebut that presumption by demonstrating that the area for on-premises consumption is physically separated or distinguishable from the area where the food not for immediate consumption is sold, Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.310(b)(1)(A). and the retailer has a separate means of recording and accounting for collection of receipts from sales of both higher- and lower-rate foods. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.310(b)(1)(B). The second factor is the nature of the food item that the retailer is selling. Illinois always considers some foods to be “food prepared for immediate consumption”(e.g., hot foods), and therefore Illinois imposes the higher tax rate on sales of those foods. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.310(b)(2); see also Illinois General Information Letter ST 11-0109-GIL (Dec. 29, 2011). BNA-SUTN IL 11.1.1.

Taxable Illinois imposes the Retailer's Occupation Tax on food sold by a catering company. 35 ILCS 120/1; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2145(a)(2)(C), (h); see also Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0051-GIL (Aug. 21, 2015); Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0037-GIL (June 5, 2015). Further, Illinois taxes a caterer's entire gross receipts from a sale — the caterer may not deduct for service costs or other overhead. 35 ILCS 120/1; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2145(a)(2)(C); see also Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0051-GIL (Aug. 21, 2015); Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0037-GIL (June 5, 2015). This is based on the general rule that the term “selling price” operates “without any deduction.” Thus, a caterer's gross receipts include all receipts associated with the food sold. 35 ILCS 120/1; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2145(a)(2); see also Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0051-GIL (Aug. 21, 2015) (responding to a food caterer's query that asked whether the entire catering bill or “only the food portions” was taxable); Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0037-GIL (June 5, 2015). Examples of a caterer's gross receipts include charges for linens, tables, chairs, dishes, glasses, flowers, labor, set-up, and delivery. The Department of Revenue reasons that these items are part of the cost of doing business as a caterer—just as they would be part of a restaurant's overhead expenses—and that it is immaterial whether the caterer bills the customer separately for these items. Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0051-GIL (Aug. 21, 2015). If a caterer charges customers separately for items not associated with the food sold (e.g., entertainment charges for singers or bands), then the caterer's separate charges for those unrelated items are not taxable. The caterer must list the unrelated charges separately on the invoice, and the customer must initial them. See Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0051-GIL (Aug. 21, 2015); Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0037-GIL (June 5, 2015) (addressing the true object test with respect to food and beverage provided incidentally to a rented banquet room).

Yes Food Sold by Not-for-Profit Organization Exemption Illinois provides a tax exemption for certain sales of food for human consumption by non-profit organizations in a food distribution program. 35 ILCS 105/3-5.5. Specifically, Illinois does not collect tax on the sale of food for human consumption that is to be consumed off the premises where it is sold (other than alcoholic beverages, soft drinks, and food that has been prepared for immediate consumption) from any not-for-profit organization, that sells food in a food distribution program at a price below the retail cost of the food to purchasers who, as a condition of participation in the program, are required to perform community service, located in a county or municipality that notifies the department, in writing, that the county or municipality does not want the tax to be collected from any of such organizations located in the county or municipality. 35 ILCS 105/3-5.5. Food Sold To Persons in Long-Term Care Facilities Exemption Illinois' exemption for food and drugs sold to persons residing in long-term care facilities expired June 30, 2016.

Food Production or Processing Manufacturing Exemption Illinois provides a manufacturing exemption from sales and use tax for the use of machinery and equipment in the production or processing of food, including the use of baking equipment such as ovens to bake bread or other bakery items, whether that baking is performed by a central bakery or a retail grocery store. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.330(d)(3)(F); Illinois Private Letter Ruling ST 17-0002-PLR (Feb. 9, 2017). However, the preparation of food and beverages by restaurants, food service establishments, and other retailers does not qualify for the manufacturing exemption. Ill. Admin.

Thus, the manufacturing exemption applies to a de minimis serviceman's purchase of glaze used to glaze baking pans for the serviceman's customers who are engaged in the production and processing of food. However, the exemption does not apply to the serviceman's customers that are restaurants, food service establishments, or other retailers.
