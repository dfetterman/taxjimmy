Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Motor Vehicles, Intrastate or Non-Commercial Use Purchase, Lease, or Rental Transactions

Taxable Effective March 1, 2013, Georgia exempts from sales and use tax the sales of motor vehicles titled in Georgia, imposing instead a TAVT at the time of purchase under Ga. Code Ann. §48-5C-1. Any motor vehicle titled in Georgia after March 1, 2013 is subject to TAVT and thus exempt from Georgia's sales and use tax. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-3(95). The exemption does not apply automobile rentals for periods of 31 days or fewer. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-3(95). The exemption does apply, however, to lease payments paid pursuant to leases of automobiles for periods exceeding 31 consecutive days providing the state and local title ad valorem tax is paid. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-3(95). The combined state and local TAVT rate is equal to:• for the period March 1, 2013, through December 31, 2013, 6.5% of the fair market value of the motor vehicle; • for the 2014 tax year, 6.75% of the fair market value of the automobile;and • for 2015 and subsequent tax years, 7% of the fair market value of the automobile. Ga. Code Ann. §48-5C-1. Prior to Georgia's implementation of the TAVT on vehicles titled after March 1, 2013, all retail sales as well as leases and rentals of automobiles, trucks, trailers, tractors, and other motor vehicles were subject to Georgia's sales and use tax. Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-2-.09; Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-2-.10. The tax was imposed on the sales price without any deduction for labor, freight, delivery, manufacturer rebates, and other charges, not including:• allowances for trade-ins; • finance or other interest charges for deferred payments billed separately; and • cash discounts provided by the selling dealer and taken at the time of sale. Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-2-.09. Individuals that purchase vehicles out-of-state and want to title and register the vehicle in Georgia, must pay the sales tax due or show proof that the applicable sales and use tax has already been paid. In the event a sales tax credit is issued, purchaser will remain liable for the difference between the sum paid out-of-state and the amount due in Georgia. Georgia Dept. of Rev., Sales and Use Tax Historical Rate Chart (Feb. 9, 2015). When sold by the manufacturer or assembler motor vehicles, and other transportation equipment manufactured or assembled in Georgia for use exclusively outside Georgia, when possession is taken from the manufacturer or assembler by the purchaser within Georgia for the sole purpose of removing the property from Georgia under the purchaser's power when the equipment does not lend itself more reasonably to removal by other means, are exempt from taxation. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-3(32). Exemptions for Nonresidents Sales of motor vehicles to nonresidents for immediate transportation to and use in another state where vehicles are required to be registered are exempt from sales and use tax. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-3(44); Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-2-.09. Exemptions for Dealers Sales and use tax does not apply to a dealer's purchase of motor vehicles, parts, and other resale items sold by a motor vehicle dealer when a properly executed Certificate of Exemption is provided to the supplier or manufacturer. Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-2-.09. Transfers to Trusts The transfer of a motor vehicle from an individual to a revocable trust is subject to Georgia's TAVT. Ga. Code Ann. §48-5C-1; Georgia Letter Ruling MV TAVT-2014-01-Revocable Trust (Jan. 6, 2014). However, Georgia provides an exemption from the TAVT when the owner's title is being corrected, replaced, or reissued to the same owner. Ga. Code Ann. §48-5C-1(d)(4); Georgia Letter Ruling MV TAVT-2014-01-Revocable Trust (Jan. 6, 2014). For example, if a taxpayer transfers the owner of a motor vehicle from herself, as individual, to a revocable trust where she is named the trustee, then the transfer will be exempt from Georgia's title ad valorum tax. Ga. Code Ann. §48-5C-1(d)(4); Georgia Letter Ruling MV TAVT-2014-01-Revocable Trust (Jan. 6, 2014). Motor Vehicle Leases Effective March 1, 2013, motor vehicles purchased and titled in Georgia are exempt from sales and use tax and annual ad valorem tax. These taxes were replaced by a one-time tax imposed on the fair market value of the vehicle called the Title Ad Valorem Tax (TAVT). The fair market value is the taxable base of the vehicle. Determination of the fair market value depends on whether the vehicle is new or used. Ga. Code Ann. §48-5C-1. Vehicles leased for periods more than 31 consecutive days are exempt from sales and use tax if the TAVT was paid. The exemption from sales and use tax does not apply to rentals of motor vehicles for periods of 31 or fewer consecutive days. Ga. Code Ann. §48-5C-1; Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-3(95). Prior to March 1, 2013, persons that lease or rent motor vehicles in Georgia must register as dealers and collect and remit tax on gross lease or rental charges, including service charges. Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-2-.10(1). 50% TAVT Deferment For Vehicles Previously Registered Out of State Georgia offers individuals a deferment equal to 50% of Georgia's title ad valorem tax due at the time the vehicle is registered within Georgia when the vehicle was previously registered in another state in which the individual resided and the individual is required to file an application for a certificate of title. Ga. Code Ann. §48-5C-1(d)(3). The deferred amount must be paid within 12 months from the date of registration. Ga. Code Ann. §48-5C-1(d)(3). Lessors of vehicles, owned by leasing companies, who register vehicles in Georgia that were previously registered in another state do not qualify for the TAVT deferment. The Georgia Department of Revenue issued letter ruling LR-MV-TAVT-2016-02-07-01-Leased Vehicle Deferment Option explaining that TAVT deferment is only eligible to individuals who register the motor vehicle and apply for a certificate of title. Ga. Code Ann. §48-5C-1(d)(3); Georgia Letter Ruling LR-MV-TAVT-2016-02-07-01-Leased Vehicle Deferment Option (Feb. 17, 2016) (ruling that a lessor of vehicle can not qualify for the 50% TAVT deferment when the owner of the leased car is not a leasing company is a firm, partnership, association, corporation, or trust rather than an individual human being). Thus individuals who have entered into a lease agreement prior to moving to Georgia are not eligible for the TAVT deferment. Ga. Code Ann. §48-5C-1(d)(3);Georgia Letter Ruling LR-MV-TAVT-2016-02-07-01-Leased Vehicle Deferment Option (Feb. 17, 2016). BNA-SUTN GA 29.3.1.
