Property has an immediate effect on the item being produced if it is an essential and integral part of the integrated extraction process. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-3(b); Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-5-9(c). The following is a non-exclusive list of examples of exempt machinery, tools, or equipment used in extraction:• oil derricks; Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-5-9(e)(2). • pumps; Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-5-9(e)(2). • pump houses; Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-5-9(e)(2). • drilling rigs; Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-5-9(e)(2). and • equipment used to test or inspect the oil or gas being extracted. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-5-9(i)(1). The fact that particular property may be considered essential to the conduct of the business of extraction because its use is required either by law or practical necessity does not, of itself, mean that the property has an immediate effect upon the extracting of the product. Instead, in addition to being essential for one of the above reasons, the property must also be an integral part of an integrated process. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-5-9(e). The extraction process begins with the first drilling of the shaft or well. It ends when the item being extracted has been physically removed from the well. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-5-9(d). Extraction means the removal of natural resources, minerals, and mineral aggregates from the earth, pits, or banks. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-5-9(k)(1). Sales of tangible personal property used in the extraction of oil and gas are additionally exempt from the state gross retail tax if: • such property constitutes, is incorporated into, or is consumed in the operation of a device, facility or structure predominantly used and acquired for the purpose of complying with state, local or federal environmental quality laws, regulations or standards; Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-30(a)(1). and • the person acquiring the property is engaged in the business of manufacturing, processing, refining, mining, recycling, or agriculture. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-30(a)(2); Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-5-70(a); see Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20140528 (Sept. 30, 2015) (exempting glass container manufacturer's purchase of pollution control chemicals used to treat its facility's discharged cooling water as required under a local municipal ordinance). In addition, machinery, tools, and equipment used directly by the purchaser in refining oil, gas, and other petroleum products for sale are considered to be used in the production of tangible personal property and are eligible for exemption as manufacturing machinery. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-3(b), as amended by 2015 Ind. S.B. 441, effective Jan. 1, 2016; see Indiana Supplemental Letter of Findings 04-20160313 (March 29, 2017). An item will not qualify for exemption if the purchaser uses it to perform a production step in the process of another. Indiana Final Order 04-20160649R (Sept. 27, 2017). Equipment and machinery used to deliver or transport refined petroleum products to the purchaser are not exempt. Specifically, “load rack equipment” (i.e., a loading and unloading platform) are not exempt. Indiana Supplemental Letter of Findings 04-20160313 (March 29, 2017).

The cost of modernizing or constructing facilities and equipment used in extraction and refining may qualify for tax credits in Indiana.
