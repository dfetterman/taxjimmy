Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Taxation of Services

Depends Rhode Island does not subject services to sales and use tax. However, Rhode Island has specifically enumerated certain services that are subject to sales and use tax. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18-7; R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18-7. The following services are taxable in Rhode Island:• producing or printing tangible personal property for consumers who provide the materials used; R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-20.8, replacing R.I. Regs. SU 87-88, effective June 25, 2018. • providing, preparing, or serving for consideration food, meals, or drinks; • providing gas or electricity; • providing telecommunications services; and • providing services for transmission of messages by telegraph, cable, radio, or television services. See R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18-7. In addition to tax on the sale of the above-described services, services performed in conjunction with a rental or lease are subject to sales and use tax in Rhode Island. Specifically, Rhode Island imposes sales tax on charges for the rent or lease of tangible personal property with no allowance for the services under R.I. Regs. §92-62. This rule was applied to impose sales tax on services provided by the lessor of storage containers in Rhode Island Admin. Hearing Decision No. 1998-24 (Nov. 25, 1998). The taxpayer leased containers and office trailers, loaded them onto a trailer, delivered them to a customer's location, and picked them up at the end of the rental period. The Division of Taxation imposed sales tax on the drop-off, pickup, cleaning, moving and waiting charges, which the taxpayer had omitted from the calculation of its sales tax liabilities.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

True Object When tangible personal property is sold in conjunction with a service, the true object of the transaction is analyzed to determine its taxability. Statewide Multiple Listing Svcs. Inc. v. Norberg, 392 A.2d 371 (R.I. 1978). If the true object is a nontaxable service, the transaction is not taxable. When the property and service aspects of the transaction are readily separable, but each is consequential, then the property and service elements must be analyzed as separate transactions for tax purposes. New England Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Clark, 624 A.2d 298 (R.I. 1993); Rhode Island Ruling Request No. 2017-01 (March 31, 2017) (where real object of a transaction is access to numerous benefits, some of which are taxable, for no additional consideration, the transaction is taxable). The Supreme Court of Rhode Island held sales of real estate booklets subject to tax in Statewide Multiple Listing Services Inc. v. Norberg. Statewide Multiple Listing Svcs. Inc. v. Norberg, 392 A.2d 371 (R.I. 1978); Gorham Inc. v. Clark, No. A.A. 95-2 (R.I. Dist. Ct. May 6, 1996). The taxpayer, Multiple Listing Services(MLS), contracted with Graphics Corp. of Minnesota (Graphics), to provide booklets. The booklets compiled descriptions of new properties, properties sold or removed from the listings, tax rates, and other information relevant to the real estate profession. All of the information was provided by MLS to Graphics which might then rearrange or reindex the information. The taxpayer was assessed use tax on its purchases of the booklets. It maintained that because the true object of the information was the service provided by Graphics, the transaction should be tax exempt. The court held that the true object of the transaction was the receipt of tangible personal property because Graphics applied no independent thought to the data; it merely rearranged it. Furthermore, the true object of the transaction, according to the court, was the translation of the data into a form readily available to MLS members and that the service was incidental. A Rhode Island District Court held that purchases of product designs and models are nontaxable service transactions because the property is incidental to the services rendered. The taxpayer in Gorham Inc. v. Clark manufactures silverware, flatware, giftware, and dolls. The company acquires product designs, conceptual art, and models from various artists. The court held that the “real object” of the transactions was the purchase of the artists' services, conveyed through designs and models that were incidental to their fees. The court explained that the designs and models were not manufactured end-products, but merely representations of what products would look like after final development. Gorham Inc. v. Clark, No. A.A. 95-2 (R.I. Dist. Ct. May 6, 1996); see also Rhode Island Admin. Hearing Decision No. 2000-22 (June 13, 2000) (charges for videotaping of depositions are taxable, because true object of transaction is resulting videotape and not service of producing tape). The Division of Taxation has ruled that a photographer's labor charges are included in the taxable sales price of photography, whether or not the charges are separately stated. Rhode Island Admin. Hearing Decision No. 2000-28 (Sept. 19, 2000). A Rhode Island Regulation incorporates the true object test to characterize sales made by typographers as sales of tangible personal property. R.I. Regs. SU 87-112. BNA-SUTN RI 9.3.1.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Bundled Transactions

Depends A bundled transaction is the retail sale of two or more products where:(1) the products are otherwise distinct and identifiable, and (2)the products are sold for one non-itemized price with the exception of real property or services to real property. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18-7.1(c). A bundled transaction does not include the sale of any product where the sales price varies or is negotiable based on the products chosen by the purchaser. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18-7.1(c). For a bundled transaction that includes a telecommunication service, an ancillary service, internet access, or an audio or video programming service, then the following rules apply:• If the price is attributable to some taxable products and some nontaxable products, then the portion of the price attributable to the nontaxable products may be subject to tax unless the provider can identify the nontaxable products by reasonable and verifiable standards from its books and records that are kept in the regular course of business for other non-tax purposes; R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18-1.31(C)(1). and • If the price is attributable to products that are subject to tax at different tax rates, then the total price may be treated as attributable to the products subject to tax at the highest tax rate unless the provider can identify by reasonable and verifiable standards the portion of the price attributable to the products subject to tax at the lower rate from its books and records that are kept in the regular course of business for other non-tax purposes. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18-1.31(C)(2). Distinct and identifiable products do not include:• packaging that accompanies the retail sale of any products that is immaterial or incidental to the sale. Packaging includes grocery sacks, shoeboxes, boxes, and dry cleaning garment bags and express delivery envelope. • a product provided free of charge that accompanies a required purchase of another product. A product is provided free of charge when the sales prices of the purchased product does not vary based on the inclusion of the free of charge product. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18-7.1(c)(i). One non-itemized price does not include a price that lists separately each product purchased on binding sales or similar sales documentation in paper or electronic form available to the customer. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18-7.1(c)(ii). Even though a transaction fits within the definition of a bundled transaction, it will not be considered a bundled transaction if it is:• the retail sale of tangible personal property and a service where the tangible personal property is critical for the use of the service, and only provided with the service, and the true object of the transaction is the service; R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18-7.1(c)(iii)(A). or • the “retail sale” of services where one service is critical for the use and receipt of a second service. The first service is only provided to be of use for the second service and the second service is the true object of transaction; R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18-7.1(c)(iii)(B). or • a transaction is de minimis when it includes taxable products and nontaxable products and the taxable products' purchase price or sales price; R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18-7.1(c)(iii)(C). or • de minimis means the seller's purchase price or sales price of the taxable products is 10 percent or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled products; R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18-7.1(c)(iii)(C)1. or • in order to determine if the taxable products are de minimis sellers are required to use the purchase price or the sales price. Sellers cannot use a combination of the purchase price and sales price of the products when determining if the taxable products are de minimis; R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18-7.1(c)(iii)(C)2, and • the full term of a service contract is used by Sellers to determine if the taxable products are de minimis; R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18-7.1(c)(iii)(C)3. • the retail sale of exempt tangible personal property and taxable tangible personal property where: ○ the transaction includes food and food ingredients, drugs, over-the-counter drugs, durable medical equipment, mobility enhancing equipment, prosthetic devices (defined in §44-18-7.1), or medical supplies; R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18-7.1(c)(iii)(D)1. and ○ Where the seller's purchase price or sales price of the taxable tangible personal property is 50 percent or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled tangible personal property. Sellers may not use a combination of the purchase price and sales price of the tangible personal property when making the 50 percent determination for a transaction. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18-7.1(c)(iii)(D)2. Taxable and Exempt Property Included In Shipment If a shipment includes both exempt and taxable property, the seller should allocate the delivery charges by using:• a percentage based on the total sales prices of the taxable property compared to the total sales price of all property in the shipment; R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-15.5(D)(1), replacing R.I. Regs. SU 07-33, effective March 18, 2018. or • a percentage based on the total weight of the taxable property compared to the total weight of all property in the shipment. R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-15.5(D)(2), replacing R.I. Regs. SU 07-33, effective March 18, 2018. The seller must tax the percentage of the delivery charge allocated to the taxable property but does not have to tax the percentage allocated to the exempt property. R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-15.5(D)(2), replacing R.I. Regs. SU 07-33, effective March 18, 2018. Cellular Telephones If a cellular telephone dealer offers a customer a “purchase allowance” towards a phone if that customer purchases a plan, the retail price of the phone chosen by the customer is taxable. R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-35.5, replacing R.I. Regs. §95-139, effective July 12, 2018. However, if a cellular telephone carrier offers a promotion where the customer receives a free cellphone if the customer signs up for a plan and agrees to continue the plan for a set amount of time, the carrier is considered the ultimate consumer of the phone. The carrier would pay the use tax on the phone, rather than charging sales tax to the customer. R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-35.6, replacing R.I. Regs. §95-139, effective July 12, 2018.
