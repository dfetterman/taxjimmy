None Prior to December 2010, New York and New Jersey had a simplified sales tax reporting program that allowed vendors of one state to voluntarily collect and remit use tax for goods or services sold to the other state. New York TSB-M-86(6)S (March 6, 1986); New York Publication 750. The simplified sales tax reporting program encouraged vendors in New York or New Jersey to register to collect the other state's tax. The program was also designed to provide for and facilitate the exchange of sales and use tax information between New York and New Jersey. New York TSB-M-86(6)S (March 6, 1986); New York Publication 750. Key aspects of the simplified sales tax reporting program were that:• each registered vendor would collect tax on items shipped to the other state at the rate of the state and locality to which the goods were delivered, even though the vendor had no business location in the neighbor state; • a vendor would be required to file a return only in the state in which he or she is located; • upon filing a return, each state would then remit to the other state the funds which it collected for its neighbor; • vendor participation in the program was voluntary; and • a registered vendor could only be subject to a single audit. New York TSB-M-86(6)S (March 6, 1986). As of Dec. 31, 2010, the simplified sales tax reporting program between New York and New Jersey was terminated. On Jan. 1, 2011, the New York Department of Taxation and Finance began evaluating all New Jersey-based filers with taxable activity in New York to determine the frequency with which they are required to file with New York.
