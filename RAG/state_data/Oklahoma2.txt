Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Tax Collection and Remittance

Vendor Oklahoma provides that vendor is required to collect sales tax from the consumer or user and then remit or pay the sales tax to the Oklahoma Tax Commission. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, § 1361; Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, § 1362. BNA-SUTN OK 31.3.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Business Owners, Operators

Yes Oklahoma holds individuals personally liable for sales tax. Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-7-3. That is to say, generally sales tax is paid by the consumer-user to the vendor as trustee for the state. Any person required to collect sales tax as a trustee for the state can be held personally liable for the sales tax due. Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-7-3. The decision as to whether an individual is personally liable for sales tax is made on an “individual case” basis. The standard to be applied is that of determining liability for payment of federal withholding tax pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or regulations promulgated pursuant to same. Once it is finally determined that a person is liable, a tax warrant which has the force and effect of a judgment or lien will be filed against that person individually for the full amount of the liability (i.e., tax, interest and penalty). Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-7-3. BNA-SUTN OK 31.3.3.

3 Years Oklahoma requires that all vendors maintain records and books of all sales of tangible personal property made for three years after the year in which the return using those records was filed. Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-3-32. These books and records must distinguish between taxable sales and exempt sales. Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-3-30(a). All books and records must clearly state all information relevant to the completion of a sales tax return, and must be made available for inspection by the Tax Commissioner during reasonable hours of any business day. The law requires that records be maintained in English, and that the records must be maintained within state borders. Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-3-30(a).

However, such companies must, upon a reasonable request, make their books and records available for inspection by the Tax Commissioner. Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-3-30(a)(3). While Oklahoma does not establish all records which must be kept, the Tax Commissioner has proved a list of the minimum set of records which must be kept. All Oklahoma vendors are required to keep:• a sales journal or log of daily sales in addition to cash register tapes and other data which will provide a daily record of the gross amount of sales; • a record of the amount of merchandise purchased. To fulfill this requirement, copies of all vendors' invoices and taxpayers' copies of purchase orders must be retained serially and in sequence as to date; and • a true and complete inventory of the value of stock on hand taken at least once each year.

Any taxpayer given the permission to destroy their books and records prior to the normal three year requirement must maintain their records in microfilm, ADP, or microfiche. Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-3-32. Microfiche and Microfilm Records may be microfilmed or microfiched as long as such microfilmed and microfiched records are authentic, accessible and readable.In addition, the following criteria must be satisfied:• reproductions of all original records must be produced upon request by the Tax Commissioner or his authorized representatives; • appropriate facilities are provided for preserving the microfilm or microfiche for the time required by Oklahoma; • microfiche or microfilm records are indexed, cross-referenced and labeled to show beginning and ending numbers or beginning and ending alphabetical listing of documents included, and are systematically filed to permit the immediate location of any particular record. A posting reference must be on each document and a control log or catalog of such documents must be maintained; • taxpayers must make available a reader or printer upon request by Tax Commissioner to review records; • when displayed or reproduced on paper, the material must be legible and readable. Legibility is defined as the quality of a letter or numeral that enables the observer to identify it positively and quickly to the exclusion of all other letters or numerals. Readability is defined as the quality of a group of letters or numerals being recognized as words or complete numbers; and • the taxpayer retains the microfilm or microfiche copies so long as the contents may be materially relevant to any audit by the Tax Commissioner. Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-3-31(b). Automated Data Process Systems (ADP) Oklahoma allows An Automated Data Process tax accounting system may be used by Oklahoma vendors to provide the records required by state law for verifying tax liability. An Automated Data Process system must include a method of producing legible and readable records which will provide the necessary information for verifying tax liability. The Automated Data Process must satisfy the following criteria: • Automated Data Process records must be able to trace any transaction back to the original source or forward to a final total. If detailed printouts are not made of transactions at the time they are processed, the systems must have the ability to reconstruct these transactions. • The Automated Data Process must be able to maintain a general ledger with source references and subsidiary ledgers. Such ledgers must be written out to coincide with financial reports for tax reporting periods. • The audit trail must be designed so that the details underlying the summary accounting data (such as sales invoices, purchase invoices, credit memoranda and like documents) are readily available to the Tax Commissioner upon request. • A description of the Automated Data Process portion of the accounting system must be made available to the Tax Commissioner upon request. The statements and illustrations describing the system and scope of Automated Data Process operations being performed must be sufficiently detailed to indicate the application being performed and the procedures employed in each application. Controls used to insure accurate and reliable processing should be noted along with the dates and nature of important changes. • Adequate record retention facilities must be available for storing tax and Automated Data Process records required for verification of tax liability. Records required would include data prepared for input in processing accounts payable, accounts receivable or any purchase or sales journal entries necessary for bookkeeping and tax reporting purposes.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Amnesty Programs 2010

Yes In 2010, Oklahoma began the Retailer Compliance Initiative, which was designed to provide amnesty to noncompliant, out-of-state retailers by furnishing an opportunity to voluntarily register, collect, and remit use taxes owed to Oklahoma in connection with the retailers'transactions performed in their capacities as vendors. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, §1407.2(B)(5). The program was available to out-of-state retailers that were not registered with Oklahoma for vendor use tax collection in the 12 months prior to July 1, 2010. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, §1407.2(B)(1). However, participation in the program required registration by an out-of-state retailer by July 1, 2011. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, §1407.2(B)(2). Once an out-of-state retailer registered with the initiative, the Oklahoma Tax Commission ceased collection and assessment of any uncollected Oklahoma vendor use taxes or any associated penalties and interest for the period that the out-of-state retailers were unregistered. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, §1407.2(B)(1). However, relief was not available under the initiative for use taxes already paid or remitted to the state, use taxes that were collected but had yet to be remitted to the state, or any matters for which the retailer had been notified of the beginning of an audit by the Commission. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, §1407.2(B)(3). The amnesty provided under the Initiative was effective on the condition that the retailer maintained collection and remittance of all use taxes owed for at least 36 months, and there was no showing of fraud or misrepresentation on the part of the retailer. The statute of limitations on tax collection was tolled during this 36-month period. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, §1407.2(B)(4). Registration under the Retailer Compliance Initiative had no effect on the determination of nexus for any other Oklahoma taxes. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, §1407.2(C). There was no registration fee for retailers that voluntarily registered to collect and remit use taxes under the Retailer Compliance Initiative. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 68, §1407.2.
