Taxable Persons who engage in the business of selling steam to purchasers for use or consumption and not for resale incur retailer's occupation tax liability on their receipts from such sales. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 130.2156(a).

Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 130.2156(a). Persons who are engaged in the business of transferring heat energy to purchasers using steam as the vehicle for that transfer do not incur retailer's occupation tax liability so long as no tangible personal property is transferred to the purchaser. This would be the case, for example, where the condensate, which results when the steam loses its heat, is returned to the seller. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 130.2156(a). BNA-SUTN IL 30.2.3.
