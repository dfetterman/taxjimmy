Topic: Interstate Agreements Streamlined Sales Tax Conformity to Agreement

Out of Compliance In its report dated Oct. 25, 2017, the Compliance Review and Interpretations Committee of the Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board (CRIC) found Georgia to be out of compliance with the Agreement. Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, 2017 Compliance Review Report (Oct. 25, 2017); see also Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, User Guide: Online Taxability Matrix and Certificate of Compliance (Nov. 20, 2018). The committee found Georgia to be out of compliance with respect to three issues. One is the state legislature's reinstatement of the “good faith” requirement for accepting exemption certificates. Though this reinstatement was made in 2012, the legislature has still not made any changes to this provision. Second is the fact that the state only accepts the Simplified Electronic Return (SER) from Model 1 sellers, rather than all sellers. This issue was originally identified as a compliance issue in 2013. Finally, during the 2017 session, the state legislature imposed a$35,000 cap on tax paid for boat repairs. This provision was intended as a tax incentive measure to attract repair facilities to the state, but was found to violate the terms of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement.
