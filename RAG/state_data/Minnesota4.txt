Taxable Aircraft sold in Minnesota are subject to sales and use taxes. Minn. Stat. §297A.82; Minnesota Aircraft Industry Guide. For Minnesota sales and use tax purposes, the term “aircraft” includes, but is not limited to:• airplanes; • drones or unmanned aircraft systems; • gliders; • gyro-copters; • helicopters; • hot air balloons; • kit planes (assembled or unassembled); • powered parachutes; • sail planes; and • ultralights and sport planes. Minn. Stat. §297A.82;Minnesota Dept. of Rev., General Information for Aircraft Owners; Minnesota Aircraft Industry Guide (replacing Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 101). The Office of Aeronautics Aircraft Registration is the entity responsible for registering and collecting sales and use tax on aircraft in Minnesota. Minn. Stat. §297A.82;Minnesota Dept. of Rev., General Information for Aircraft Owners. A trade-in deduction is allowed for aircraft if all of the following conditions are met:• the sale is conducted by a licensed aircraft dealer, or a lessor registered to collect and remit Minnesota sales tax; • an invoice or sales agreement shows the transaction was a trade and the value of each aircraft; • the federal registration numbers of both aircraft are shown; and • the new owners each complete their own Aircraft Registration, unless the licensed Minnesota aircraft dealer handled the transaction. Minnesota Aircraft Industry Guide. If the trade is not conducted by a licensed aircraft dealer or lessor, tax is due on both aircraft, based on the value of each aircraft. Minnesota Aircraft Industry Guide. Temporary Presence in State Any aircraft in Minnesota for 60 days or more during a calendar year must register and pay sales tax. Minnesota Dept. of Rev., General Information for Aircraft Owners. Non-Minnesota buyers who take possession of an aircraft in Minnesota are exempt from Minnesota sales and use tax if they transport the aircraft outside of Minnesota and if:• the aircraft returns to Minnesota only for interstate commerce or occasional use; • the aircraft is registered in another state or country; • the aircraft meets the definitions in Minn. Stat. §360.511 and is approved by the Federal Aviation Administration; and • the aircraft is only used for a training period of up to 10 days before the buyer removes it from the state. Minn. Stat. §297A.82(4)(d); Minnesota Aircraft Industry Guide. Purchases of Aircraft by Nonprofit Incorporated Flying Clubs A nonprofit incorporated flying club or association may buy aircraft used for leasing purposes and aircraft repair parts exempt from sales tax. The club must collect sales tax from its shareholders and/or members on all rental fees, dues, membership fees, and all other fees and charges assessed upon the members. When the flying club registers the aircraft, it must file the Aircraft Registration. The club may use lease as the exemption reason to show that the aircraft is owned by a nonprofit incorporated flying club or association and should attach a copy of the club's charter and by-laws and list the club's Minnesota Tax ID Number. Minnesota Aircraft Industry Guide. Lease-Backs between Owners and Fixed-base Operators Minnesota requires fixed-base operators (FBO)to collect and remit sales tax on aircraft leased to others that was purchased by the owner from an FBO and subsequently leased back to the same FBO. The Fix-based operator must remit use tax on amounts paid to the owner for its own taxable use of the aircraft. Minnesota Aircraft Industry Guide. If the FBO leases an aircraft to the owner, tax may be handled in either of the following ways:• The FBO collects sales tax from the owner and reports the tax collected as Aircraft Sales on the sales and use tax return. The lease price should be based on amounts charged to other lessees or the fair market rental value; or • The owner reports use tax directly to the state on the owner's own return on the Aircraft Purchases tax line. Minnesota Aircraft Industry Guide. Aircraft for Field Spraying and Dusting Purchases of aircraft used directly and principally in agricultural spraying are required to be registered with the Minnesota Department of Transportation, but are not subject to Minnesota sales and use tax. Minnesota Agricultural and Farming Industry Guide. Fractional Ownership Interests Use tax is due on a fractional ownership interest of an aircraft in Minnesota if:• the buyer uses the aircraft in Minnesota; • the aircraft was not purchased for resale; and • no sales tax was paid on the aircraft or sales tax was paid to a state with a lower tax rate than Minnesota. Minnesota Aircraft Industry Guide. For more information on the exemption for aircraft used as farm machinery, see Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Minnesota 25.1. BNA-SUTN MN 29.1.1.
