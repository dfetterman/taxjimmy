Exempt The sales and use tax does not apply to the transfer of real property. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.294(k). See Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201511615L (Nov. 20, 2015). “Real property”is defined as land, including structures and other improvements that are embedded into or permanently affixed to the land. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.357(a)(10). However, mining and timber operations do not, in and of themselves, constitute improvements to realty. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.347; see also Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 39,903 (July 24, 2001). The determination of whether tangible personal property has been affixed such that it has become part of the real property depends on the intention of the parties. Texas Attorney General, Opinion No. M-298 (Oct. 22, 1968). Texas does not impose its sales and use tax on tangible personal property that is included with a lease or rental of real property. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.294(k); see also Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201511615L (Nov. 20, 2015) (lease by private prison operator of real property that included lease of land, furniture, fixtures, equipment and structures that may remain tangible personal property, is not subject to sales and use tax). Unprocessed Sand, Gravel, and Similar Materials Unprocessed sand, gravel, and similar materials are not subject to Texas sales and use tax. See, e.g., Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201901045L (Jan. 25, 2019). Processed sand is sand that is crushed, mixed, or subject to any other process other than basic washing and sorting. The washing, drying, screening for size, and sorting of sand, gravel and similar materials is not processing. Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201901047L (Jan. 25, 2019); Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201901049L (Jan. 25, 2019) (sales of sand that is sorted and washed are exempt as sales of unprocessed sand).

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal General Rule for Classification

Three-part Test Texas determines whether tangible personal property has become a fixture to real property using the three-part test articulated in Hutchins v. Masterson. Hutchins v. Masterson, 46 Tex. 551 (1877); see Logan v. Mullis, 686 S.W.2d 605 (Tex. 1985). In general, “fixtures” are tangible personal property that becomes a part of any building or other structure, project, development, or other permanent improvement on or to such real property including tangible personal property that, after installation, becomes real property by virtue of being embedded in or permanently affixed to the land or structure constituting realty. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.300; Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.291(a)(7); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.347. The determination of whether tangible personal property has been affixed such that it has become part of the real property depends on the intention of the parties. Texas Attorney General Opinion No. M-298 (Oct. 22, 1968). In Hutchins v. Masterson, the Texas Supreme Court stated that the following three questions should be posed when determining whether tangible personal property is an improvement to real property:• Has there been a real or constructive annexation of the article in question to realty? • Was there a fitness or adaptation of the article to the uses or purposes of the realty with which it is connected? • Whether or not it was the intention of the party making the annexation for the personal property to become a permanent accession to the realty: (a) is this intention inferable from the nature of the article; (b) what is the relation and situation of the parties interested; (c) what is the policy of the law in respect thereto;and (d) what is the mode of annexation and purpose or use for which the annexation is made? Hutchins v. Masterson, 46 Tex. 551 (1877); see Texas Attorney General Opinion No. M-298 (Oct. 22, 1968); see also Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 107,056 (July 15, 2016). In a case concerning property law, rather than tax law, the Texas Supreme Court provided the following three factors to be used in determining whether tangible personal property has been affixed to real property:(1) the intent of the contracting parties; (2) the mode and sufficiency of annexation(either real or constructive); and (3) the adaptation of the article of tangible personal property to the use or purpose of the realty. Logan v. Mullis, 686 S.W.2d 605 (Tex. 1985); see Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 47,404 (Mar. 2, 2009). Oil and gas flow lines, whether above or below ground, are presumed to be tangible personal property. Evidence may be able to establish that the flow lines were so installed as to be annex to realty and therefore could be considered nontaxable new construction. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,516 (April 17, 2018). BNA-SUTN TX 28.2.1.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal Sale and Installation of Appliances, Electronics, Machinery, and Equipment

Taxable In Texas, the sale and installation of appliances, electronics, machinery, and equipment is generally subject to sales and use tax. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.347(b)(1); see Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.294(k). The sale and installation of machinery, equipment, and any other tangible personal property not essential to the building or structure, nor adapted or intended to become a part of the real property, but which incidentally may be temporarily attached to the real property is not considered an improvement to real property, provided that the tangible personal property does not lose its identity as a particular piece of machinery, equipment, or other tangible personal property and that if the tangible personal property is attached to the real property, it can be removed without substantial damage to the unit or to the real property and without destroying the intended usefulness of the real estate. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.347(b)(1). For business owners, the Comptroller has held that custom display cases, wall displays, fitting rooms, cabinets, cash wrap counters, kiosks, and retail signage qualify as improvements to real property and are the sale and installation of the items is not subject to sales or use tax. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 109,127 (Aug. 6, 2015). BNA-SUTN TX 28.2.2.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal Sale and Installation of Plumbing Fixtures

Depends The sale and installation of plumbing fixtures is taxable when the installation of the plumbing fixtures is performed as a repair or remodeling service to nonresidential real property. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101(a)(13); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0047(a); see Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,156 (Aug. 18, 2017). If the sale and installation of plumbing fixtures is performed as a repair or remodeling service to residential real property, the charges are not subject to sales tax. Additionally, if the sale and installation of plumbing fixtures is performed as part of the new construction of either residential or nonresidential real property, the charges are nontaxable. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0047(a); see Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101; Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.347(b). For sales tax purposes, “residential real property” is property that is used as a family dwelling, multifamily apartment or housing complex, nursing home, condominium, or retirement home. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.347(a)(13). “Repair” is to mend or bring back real property that was broken, damaged, or defective as near as possible to its original working order. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.347(a)(12). “Restoration” is work performed to bring back real property that is still considered operational and functional, but has faded, declined, or deteriorated, as near as possible to its original condition. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.347(a)(14). “New construction” is all new improvements to real property, including initial finish out work to the interior or exterior of the improvement. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.347(a)(8). BNA-SUTN TX 28.2.3.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal Sale and Installation of Flooring and Window Treatments

Depends The taxability of the sale and installation of flooring and window treatments depends on the nature of the item, the nature of the installation, and the type of property on which the installation occurs. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101(a)(13); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0047(a); see Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 101,643 (May 10, 2010). Flooring The sale and installation of flooring, such as tile or carpeting, is taxable when it is performed as a repair or remodeling service to nonresidential real property. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101(a)(13); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0047(a); see Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 101,643 (May 10, 2010). The sale and installation of flooring is nontaxable when it is performed as a part of new construction to either residential or nonresidential real property or as a part of repair or remodeling service to residential real property. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0047(a); see Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101; Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.347(b); see also Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 110,638 (April 22, 2015). Window Treatments To determine whether or not the sale and installation of window treatments is taxable, one must first determine whether the window treatments are affixed to the real property. See Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 200502725L (Feb. 17, 2005). In making this determination, the Comptroller has looked at whether or not substantial damage would occur if the window treatments were removed. See Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 200502725L (Feb. 17, 2005); Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 200209448L (Sept. 18, 2002); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 34,553 (May 6, 1996). Generally, items such as drapes and curtains are not affixed to real property and will be treated as the sale and installation of tangible personal property. Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 200209448L (Sept. 18, 2002). However, shutters which were attached to window frames using nails, glue, and caulk were deemed to be an improvement to real property. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 34,553 (May 6, 1996). If window treatments are found to have retained their character as tangible personal property, then the charges for the sale and installation of these items are subject to sales tax. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.007(a)(3); Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 200502725L (Feb. 17, 2005). If window treatments are found to have become a fixture to real property, the taxability of the sale and installation of such items is treated the same as the sale and installation of flooring. Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 200502725L (Feb. 17, 2005). These charges are taxable if the sale and installation is performed as part of a repair or remodeling service to nonresidential real property. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101(a)(13); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0047(a); see Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 101,643 (May 10, 2010). Such charges are nontaxable if performed as new construction or as a repair or remodeling service to residential real property. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0047(a); see Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101; Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.347(b); see also Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 110,638 (April 22, 2015). BNA-SUTN TX 28.2.4.

Nontaxable The sale and installation of retail signage is not subject to sales tax. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 109,127 (Aug. 6, 2015). Retail signage is considered to be an improvement to real property and is thus not taxable. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 109,127 (Aug. 6, 2015). BNA-SUTN TX 28.2.5.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal Character of Leasehold Improvements

Depends Whether leasehold improvements will be characterized as tangible personal property or real property depends on the nature of the improvements. See Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 35,969 (Dec. 17, 2003). The same test is used for whether or not tangible personal property has been affixed to real property in general and for determining the character of leasehold improvements. See Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 35,969 (Dec. 17, 2003); see also Hutchins v. Masterson, 46 Tex. 551 (1877). Texas does not impose its sales and use tax on tangible personal property that is included with a lease or rental of real property. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.294(k); see also Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201511615L (Nov. 20, 2015) (lease by private prison operator of real property that included lease of land, furniture, fixtures, equipment and structures that may remain tangible personal property, is not subject to sales and use tax).

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Construction Materials and Contracts Construction Materials and Contracts, Generally

Depends Charges for construction labor billed to a contractee are not subject to sales and use tax in Texas, unless the charges are for real property repair or remodeling. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101(a)(13). “Real property repair and remodeling” means the repair, restoration, remodeling, or modification of an improvement to real property other than:• a structure or separate part of a structure used as a residence; • an improvement immediately adjacent to such a residential structure or separate part of the structure and used in the residential occupancy of the structure or separate part of the structure by the person using the structure or part as a residence; or • an improvement to a manufacturing or processing production unit in a petrochemical refinery or chemical plant that provides increased capacity in the production unit. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0047(a). A repairman or remodeler performing taxable real property repair and remodeling services may purchase tangible personal property that will be incorporated into a customer's realty exempt from tax under Texas' resale exemption. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.357(e)(1). When a contractor performs construction services that are nontaxable because they constitute new construction or the repair, restoration, remodeling, or modification of residential real property, the tax treatment of the construction materials depends on whether the construction is performed under a lump-sum or separated contract. See Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.056(a); Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.056(b). If a contractor performs nontaxable construction services pursuant to a lump-sum contract, the contractor owes tax on all materials, consumable items, equipment, taxable services, and other taxable items that are used by the contractor or incorporated into a customer's property. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.056(a); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.291(b)(3); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 114,183 (Nov. 20, 2017). “Lump-sum contract” is defined as a contract where the agreed contract price is one lump-sum amount and in which the charges for incorporated materials are not separate from any charges for skill and labor, including fabrication, installation, and other labor that the contractor performs. Separated invoices issued to the customer will not change a lump-sum contract into a separated contract unless the terms of the contract require separated invoices. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.291(a)(8); see Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 106,096 (June 8, 2015) (contract listing a single-sum total price on its face and indicating that the price consisted of separate service and material components was treated as a separated contract where separated invoices were issued by the contractor). If a contractor performs nontaxable construction services pursuant to a separated contract, the contractor will be treated as a retailer of all materials that are physically incorporated into the realty that is being improved. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.056(b); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.291(b)(4). As a retailer, the contractor must collect tax from the customer based upon the agreed contract price of the incorporated materials. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.291(b)(4)(A). The agreed contract price of the materials cannot be less than the price the contractor paid for the building materials. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.291(b)(4)(A). The contractor may purchase the materials exempt from tax under Texas' resale exemption. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.291(b)(4)(B). “Separated contract” is defined as a contract where the agreed contract price is divided into a separately stated agreed contract price for incorporated materials and a separately stated amount for all skill and labor that includes fabrication, installation, and other labor that is performed by the contractor. If prices of incorporated materials and labor are separately stated in any part of the contract or in a document that becomes part of the contract according to the terms of the contract, adding the charges together to give a sum total does not change the contract into a lump-sum contract. Cost-plus contracts are considered separated contracts if the cost of labor is separately stated from the cost for incorporated materials. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.291(a)(12). All persons who remodel non-residential real property must collect tax on the total sale price to the customer. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 114,230 (June 7, 2018)(roofing contractor should have collected tax on the lump-sum amount). Remodeling includes painting, running electric cables and installing permanent fixtures in real property. Texas Tax Policy News (Oct. 2010); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,324 (March 23, 2017) (repainting is presumed to be a taxable restoration or remodeling activity); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,685 (Nov. 9, 2017) (roofing contractor was providing taxable real property repair service). When no written contracts are available, the comptroller must look to existing documentary evidence, such as invoices, to determine what type of agreement is in place to determine the tax consequences of the transaction. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 108,807 (March 22, 2017). Real property services are not taxable if purchased by a contractor as part of an improvement to real property with a new structure to be used as a residence or other improvement immediately adjacent to the new structure and used in the structure's residential occupancy. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0048(b); Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201304670L (April 2, 2013); Texas Tax Publication 94-123. A contract for the improvement of realty includes a contract to: erect, construct, alter, or repair any building or other structure, project, development, or other permanent improvement on, under the surface of, or to real property, whether fee or leasehold;or to furnish and install property becoming a part of any building or other structure, project, development, or other permanent improvement on or to such real property including tangible personal property, which after installation becomes real property by virtue of being embedded in or permanently affixed to the land or to a structure constituting realty and which property after installation is necessary to the intended usefulness of the building or other structure; to alter the land surface of real property by such means as creating roads, earthen dams, and stock tanks. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.347. Carpet Cleaning and Repair Services Examples of carpet cleaning and repair services that are taxable include:• carpet cleaning in residential and nonresidential properties; • upholstery cleaning; • carpet repairs in nonresidential property (e.g., to reinstall or lay, stretch and repair seams); • water extraction in nonresidential properties such as office building, retail stores, and hotels; • treating or applying carpet with protective chemicals (e.g., Scotchgard or similar products); • applying chemicals for odor control or to prevent or eliminate mold and mildew;or • hauling away carpet or pad ruined by water damage, from either residential or nonresidential property. Texas Tax Publication 98-709. New Construction The taxable repair, restoration, or remodeling of nonresidential real property does not include new construction. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.291(a)(8); see also Texas Tax Publication 96-259; Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,486 (Oct. 31, 2016) (taxpayer's business of remodeling existing commercial real property constituted taxable remodeling services, not lump-sum new construction); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 108,773 (Jan. 24, 2014) (the Department of Revenue's assessment was affirmed because the taxpayer failed to produce sufficient evidence to dispute the finding that it performed taxable remodeling services on commercial real property. Although, the taxpayer alleged that it performed non-taxable new construction services, its failure to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the work perform was non-taxable new construction led the Comptroller to affirm the assessment); see also Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,425 (Feb. 24, 2016) (refund claim denied where none of taxpayer's documentation supported assertion that its work described as “new ground-up expansion” constituted nontaxable new construction). Texas defines the term “new construction”as all new improvements to real property, including initial finish-out work of the improvement's interior or exterior. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.291(a)(8); see also Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 106,258 (May 12, 2014) (invoices and estimates with notations including “bid for plumbing on new construction,” “rough in” and “final draw on bid” were insufficient to show that projects were nontaxable new construction); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,270 (March 21, 2018) (work performed after the initial finish-out is remodeling, even if the improvement has not been occupied or used). New construction also includes adding new, usable square footage to an existing structure. However, reallocating existing square footage inside a structure is remodeling rather than new construction. Raising the ceiling of a room or the roof of a building is not new construction unless new, usable square footage is created. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.291(a)(8). Taxpayers must have corroborating documentation in order to qualify for the nontaxable new construction exemption. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 108,627 (Aug. 6, 2014); see e.g., Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,864 (Sept. 19, 2017) (invoices and job summaries with hand-written notation “new construction”was not sufficient to prove that the work performed was nontaxable new construction); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 107,056 (July 15, 2016) (labor for building pipe bridge over a railroad at manufacturer's fertilizer plant and labor for pouring a new foundation constituted nontaxable new construction, however, labor for fabricating a “wall pipe rack” and partial demolition of existing building was not new construction). If a combination of nontaxable new construction services and taxable repair services are performed for a single charge, a showing by the comptroller's office that more than 5 percent of the charge is for taxable services establishes a prima facie case that the entire charge is taxable. The taxpayer can overcome the presumption by providing documentary evidence that establishes the percentages of the charges that relate to taxable and nontaxable services. However, absent such evidence, the entire amount is subject to tax. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.357(b)(9); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 115,503 (March 21, 2019). Distinguishing Residential and Nonresidential Real Property The term “residential property”means property that is used as a family dwelling, multifamily apartment or housing complex, nursing home, condominium, or retirement home. Examples of nonresidential real property are hospitals, office buildings, refineries, warehouses, parking garages, retail shops, restaurants, manufacturing facilities, and other commercial establishments. Residential real property includes homeowners association-owned and apartment-owned swimming pools, laundry rooms, and other common areas for tenants’use. Common areas of mixed residential and nonresidential property are allocated or prorated based on the ratio of residential to nonresidential use of the property. However, residential real property does not include any commercial area open to nonresidents, retail outlets, hospitals, hotels, or any other facilities that are subject to Texas' hotel occupancy tax. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.357(a)(13); see Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 109,831 (Dec. 19, 2017) (ALJ unable to determine whether real property dredging services were taxable because taxpayer did not provide evidence to show which properties were residential and which were commercial). Down-to-the-Dirt Policy Texas follows what is called the “down-to-the-dirt policy” when determining whether the replacement of a parking lot or street constitutes taxable remodeling or nontaxable new construction. The Texas Comptroller has consistently ruled that such an improvement must be completely removed down to the soil or dirt in order for the replacement of the improvement to be considered nontaxable new construction. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 104,332 (June 24, 2011). In a situation where only a portion of a parking lot is removed, even if that portion that is removed is down to the dirt, it is still taxable as a taxable remodeling service because the entire parking lot was not removed. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 104,332 (June 24, 2011). Pipeline Work For construction services, installing a new pipeline in a new trench is new construction, and the labor is not taxable. The new pipeline's location in relation to an existing pipeline does not affect the tax treatment. Additionally, removing an existing pipeline and installing a new pipeline at a lower or greater depth is new construction and the labor is not taxable if the pipeline's depth changes substantially (the new pipeline's depth must be at least one-third deeper or shallower than the existing pipeline's depth). This excavation work to remove the existing pipeline and install the new deeper or shallower pipeline is complete demolition and new construction work, respectively. The labor is not taxable. Texas Tax Policy News December 2018; Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201706007L (June 26, 2017); see also Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,270 (March 21, 2018) (installation of pipeline cleaning equipment was a taxable modification and upgrade of real property, not new construction). In all instances, connecting the new pipeline to an existing pipeline is nonresidential real property repair or remodeling and is taxable. Likewise, replacing the existing pipeline with a new pipeline at the same depth is taxable nonresidential real property repair or remodeling work. Texas Tax Policy News December 2018. For abandoning the pipeline, filling an existing pipeline with concrete is not taxable because it is complete pipeline demolition. If, however, the service provider caps the ends of an existing pipeline in order to abandon the pipeline in place, the labor is taxable nonresidential real property repair or remodeling. Texas Tax Policy News December 2018. Manufacturing Exemption A contractor that also fabricates the personal property it sells and installs into real property may not claim manufacturing exemptions on building materials and consumable supplies used in the performance of a contract to improve real property. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.056(f). If the contractor/fabricator purchased fabrication equipment tax-free as a manufacturer, the contractor must pay use tax on the divergent use of the equipment to complete the contract to improve real property. Further, only a manufacturer may claim exemption from tax on qualifying manufacturing equipment installed into real property. That means a construction contract must separate charges for building materials and qualifying machinery and equipment for the exemption to apply. If instead manufacturing equipment is installed as an improvement to real property under a lump-sum contract, the equipment is taxable to the contractor (the consumer of taxable items used in the completion of the contract). Neither the contractor nor the manufacturer may claim an exemption on such otherwise qualifying manufacturing equipment. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.291(b)(12); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.300(i). Cement Texas exempts sales of cement from sales and use tax. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.308(a)(4). Instead, cement is subject to a cement production tax. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §181.001; see Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201502033L (Feb. 6, 2015) (cement to which pigment is added remains subject to the cement production tax in lieu of sales and use tax). For more information, see the Excise Tax Navigator, at Texas 7.3.2. Ready Mix Cement A ready mix concrete contractor must separate and individually invoice the customer for each yard of ready mixed concrete produced and consumed for the improvement of real property and collect sales tax on the ready mixed concrete produced and consumed. Tax is due based on the invoice price or fair market value of ready mixed concrete, whichever is greater. This provision, however, does not apply to a public works project. A “ready mix concrete contractor"is a person who manufactures or produces ready mixed concrete for construction and incorporates the ready mixed concrete into the real property. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.056 Sale for Resale A contractor's purchase of removable furniture, fixtures, and equipment pursuant to a construction contract is not entitled to the resale exemption unless title is transferred when purchased. In Day & Zimmermann, Inc. v. Calvert, Day &Zimmermann, Inc. v. Calvert, 519 S.W.2d 106 (Tex. 1975). the Texas Supreme Court upheld a sales and use tax refund in favor of a contractor based on the sale for resale exemption. However, in that case, the contract between the parties contained an automatic title-transfer provision. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 109,099 (March 9, 2017). BNA-SUTN TX 28.3.1.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Construction Materials and Contracts Lump-Sum Construction Contracts, Contractor's Purchases of Materials

Depends The taxability of a contractor's purchases of materials for incorporation into real property under a lump-sum construction contract depends on whether the contractor is performing nontaxable construction services or taxable real property repair and remodeling. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.056(a); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.291(b)(3); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.357(e)(1). If a contractor performs nontaxable construction services pursuant to a lump-sum contract, the contractor owes tax on all materials, consumable items, equipment, taxable services, and other taxable items that are used by the contractor or incorporated into a customer's property. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.056(a); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.291(b)(3). The contractor cannot collect from a customer any amount represented to be tax on a lump-sum charge or on any portion of the charge. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.056(a); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.291(b)(3)(A); see Able Irrigation Co. v. Calvert, 495 S.W.2d 270 (Tex. App. 1973) (lump-sum contractor liable for tax on tangible personal property purchased and incorporated into the project); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 106,841 (March 17, 2014) (lump-sum contractor failing to show that materials were purchased for incorporation into real property of an exempt organization was liable for tax on the materials). A contractor performing a lump-sum contract may not accept a direct payment exemption certificate. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.291(b)(3)(D). A contractor who performs lump-sum contracts in addition to selling taxable items at retail may purchase items for a tax-free inventory when the contractor does not know at the time of purchase whether the item will be resold or used in a lump-sum contract. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.291(b)(3)(B); Texas Comptroller's Decision Hearing No. 111, 814 (March 6, 2018). If the contractor later uses the items for incorporation into real property under a lump-sum contract, the contractor owes sales or use tax on the items. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.291(b)(3)(C); Texas Comptroller's Decision Hearing No. 111, 814 (March 6, 2018) (the tax owed is based on the purchase price of the materials). A repairman or remodeler performing taxable real property repair and remodeling services may purchase tangible personal property that will be incorporated into a customer's realty exempt from tax under Texas' resale exemption. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.357(e)(1). “Real property repair and remodeling” means the repair, restoration, remodeling, or modification of an improvement to real property other than:• a structure or separate part of a structure used as a residence; • an improvement immediately adjacent to such a residential structure or separate part of the structure and used in the residential occupancy of the structure or separate part of the structure by the person using the structure or part as a residence; or • an improvement to a manufacturing or processing production unit in a petrochemical refinery or chemical plant that provides increased capacity in the production unit.

Repairs on Real Property in a Declared Disaster Area Texas does not impose sales and use tax on separately stated charges for labor to repair or restore nonresidential real property damaged in a disaster area by the condition that caused the area to be declared a disaster. However, tax is due on any materials used to perform the repairs or restoration. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.357(d)(9). Although labor charges for repair or remodeling residential property generally are not subject to tax, any materials used during the repair or restoration are taxable, even in a disaster area.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Services to Real Property Interior Real Property Maintenance

Depends Texas does not impose sales or use tax on qualified interior real property maintenance. However, janitorial services are taxable. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.356(a)(7); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.357(d)(2). Texas Tax Publication 94-111 (taxable services generally); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 26,991 (April 17, 1991); see also Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101(a)(11) (identifying real property services as taxable services in Texas); Texas Tax Publication 96-259. For this purpose, Texas defines the term “maintenance” as scheduled, periodic work that is necessary to sustain or support safe, efficient, continuous operations, or to prevent the improvement from declining, failing, lapsing, or deteriorating. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.357(a)(7). Thus, Texas distinguishes between maintenance work and work to remodel, modify, upgrade, perform major repair, or restore, even if the latter types of work are scheduled or periodic. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.357(a)(7); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.357(a)(11). The following services are considered taxable janitorial services rather than interior real property maintenance:• window washing; • floor, wall, and ceiling cleaning; • on-premise waste collection; • chimney or duct cleaning; • lighting maintenance, such as bulb and fuse replacement; • rest-room cleaning, disinfecting, and restocking; • cleaning or washing sidewalks or parking lots; and • pool cleaning and maintenance. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.356(a)(7). However, janitorial services do not include activities such as:• painting; • wallpapering; • water extraction; • significant repairs;or • domestic services (e.g., the services of a baby-sitter, maid, or cook employed by a private household to provide domestic services for the household's benefit). Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.356(a)(7). Painting, wallpapering, and repairing non-residential real property are taxable services. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.356(a)(7). “Scheduled”maintenance services are those services which are anticipated and designated to occur within a given time period or production level. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.357(a)(7)(A). “Periodic” maintenance services are those services which are ongoing, continual, or occurring at intervals that are reasonably predictable. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.357(a)(7)(B). The scheduled shutdown of a manufacturing plant is scheduled and periodic maintenance and is not taxable. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.357(a)(7)(C). Work that is performed on an as-needed basis is neither scheduled nor periodic, and will be subject to tax. GATX Terminals Corp. v. Rylander, 78 S.W.3d 630 (Tex. App. 2002) (holding that painting required approximately every 10 years was not scheduled and periodic because the condition of the previous paint job was considered in determining when the property would be painted). To qualify a purchase as nontaxable real property maintenance, a service provider's customer must prove by way of maintenance schedules, work orders, or other similar forms of evidence that the services qualify as scheduled and periodic real property maintenance. If the service provider does not have a written contract, but is only hired on a per-job basis, then the service provider must presume that the service is repair or restoration of nonresidential real property and must therefore collect tax. If the customer has documentation to prove that the service qualifies as maintenance, then the customer may issue to the service provider an exemption certificate in lieu of paying tax or provide the documentation required to overcome the presumption. The certificate must state that the labor is qualified real property maintenance—rather than repair or restoration—and that the customer is liable for any additional tax due if the Comptroller determines that a taxable service was performed. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.357(d)(2)(A); see, e.g., Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 114,141 (Sept. 7, 2018) (petitioner's bare assertion that grease-trap cleaning was a nontaxable real property maintenance service was insufficient); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 103,035 (April 11, 2014); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 40,789 (Oct. 1, 2003); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 109,876 (Jan. 28, 2014). Texas regulations also address mixed contracts involving both nontaxable maintenance and taxable repairs or restoration. See Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.357(d)(2)(B). Repairs or restoration of nonresidential real property that are performed under a claimed maintenance contract do not change a nontaxable maintenance contract into a taxable repair or restoration contract if the charges that are attributable to the repairs or restoration are 5 percent or less of the overall charge. This 5-percent test applies to each contract and subcontract. Absent a written contract, the 5-percent test applies to the total charge billed by each service provider. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.357(d)(2)(B). However, Texas treats a mixed contract as taxable in total if the charges for repairs, restoration services, or both exceed 5 percent of the total charges and are not separately identified to the customer in the contract or billing. All separately stated charges for repair, restoration, remodeling, or other taxable services are taxable, even if the taxable services constitute 5 percent or less of the total contract price. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.357(d)(2)(C); see Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 115,503 (March 21, 2019). BNA-SUTN TX 28.4.4.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Contractor Classifications

Defined A “contractor”is generally defined to include any person who builds new improvements to residential or nonresidential real property, completes any part of an uncompleted new structure that is an improvement to residential or nonresidential real property, and makes improvements to real property as part of periodic and scheduled maintenance of nonresidential real property. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.291(a)(3). It also includes any person who repairs, restores, maintains, or remodels residential real property, and who, in making the improvement, incorporates tangible personal property into the real property that is improved. The term includes subcontractors but does not include material men, suppliers, or persons who provide taxable real property services. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.291(a)(3). Taxable service providers include entities or individuals that repair, remodel, or restore nonresidential real property. Texas Tax Policy News August 2018. All persons who repair, restore, or remodel nonresidential real property must collect tax on the total sales price to the customer less separately stated charges for unrelated services. The total sales price does not include Texas sales and use tax that the service provider must collect from customers. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.357(b)(2). A contractor working on residential real property or on new construction of nonresidential realty may enter into a lump-sum or a separated contract. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.291(b)(3); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.291(b)(4). The contractor's responsibility for sales and use tax depends on whether the contract is lump-sum or separated. See Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.291(b)(3); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.291(b)(4). A contractor who, in addition to performing lump-sum contracts, sells, leases, or rents taxable items over the counter or performs separated contracts may maintain a tax-free inventory of items that are held for resale. A contractor who, in addition to performing lump-sum contracts, performs nonresidential real property repair, restoration, and remodeling services and resells taxable items as part of those taxable services may also maintain a tax-free inventory of items that are held for resale. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.291(b)(3)(B); Texas Comptroller's Decision Hearing No. 111, 814 (March 6, 2018). If the contractor later uses the items, that is, incorporates the items into real property under a lump-sum contract, the contractor owes sales or use tax on the items. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.291(b)(3)(C); Texas Comptroller's Decision Hearing No. 111, 814 (March 6, 2018) (the tax owed is based on the purchase price of the materials). BNA-SUTN TX 28.5.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Subcontractors

Not defined The term “contractor” includes subcontractors.” Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.291(a)(3). For tax purposes, subcontractors are not required to use the same type of contract as the general contractor. For example, a general or prime contract may be lump-sum, while some or all subcontracts may be separated. Each subcontractor's individual contract governs the subcontractor's tax responsibilities. In the example given, the subcontractors with separated contracts must, assuming the contract is for new construction or performed on residential real property, collect sales tax from the general contractor. The general contractor must not collect any tax from the general contractor's customer. When the general or prime contract separately states labor and incorporated materials but some of the subcontracts are lump-sum, the prime or general contractor should treat the lump-sum charges as part of its separately stated labor charge and should not collect tax from the prime contractor's customer on those charges from lump-sum subcontractors. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.291(b)(6). BNA-SUTN TX 28.6.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Contracts with Exempt Entities

Exempt Tangible personal property purchased for incorporation into real estate under a contract for an improvement to realty for an organization exempt under Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.309 or Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.310 is exempt from Texas sales and use tax. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.311(a). This exemption includes contracts with nonexempt entities to improve real property for the primary use and benefit of a governmental entity exempt under Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.309 or a religious, educational, or public service organization exempt under Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.310 that have applied for and received a letter of exemption from the Comptroller. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.311(a); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.291(a)(5); see also Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201603709L (March 18, 2016) (qualified consumable items are exempt from sales and use tax if used to benefit a tax-exempt entity; silt fences and other erosion control devices are consumable items); Texas Comptroller's Decision Hearing Nos. 44,896, 47,235 (Oct. 19, 2009) (contracts for the improvement of an airport terminal and locker rooms were exempt from sales and use tax because the contracts were for the primary use and benefit of the exempted airport and the improvements related to the exempt purpose of the exempted airport). But see Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201803006L (March 1, 2018) (contract with nonexempt entity to improve retail space on public university campus found not to be for the primary use and benefit of the university). The purchase of tangible personal property, other than machinery or equipment and its accessories and repair and replacement parts, for use in the performance of an exempt contract is also exempt if the tangible personal property is necessary and essential for the performance of the contract and completely consumed at the job site. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.311(d). Tangible personal property is considered completely consumed if, after being used once for its intended purpose, it is used up or destroyed. Tangible personal property that is rented or leased for use in the performance of a contract cannot be completely consumed. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.311(d); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,545 (June 1, 2018) (rental of traffic control equipment taxable because rented items are not completely consumed). The purchase of a taxable service for use in the performance of an exempt contract is also exempt if the service is performed at the job site and:• the contract expressly requires the specific service to be provided or purchased by the person performing the contract; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.311(c)(1). or • the service is integral to the performance of the contract. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.311(c)(2). Agency Agreements Exempt organizations are permitted to form agency agreements with their contractors, whereby a contractor is authorized to make tax-free purchases on the exempt organization's behalf. Such an agreement requires the following three elements: (1) the agent acting for the principal; (2) consent to the arrangement by both parties; and (3) the agent must be under the principal's control. Despite the fact that an agency agreement might be implied from the parties’ conduct, a written agreement is the only way to verify an agency agreement. Texas Tax Policy News October 2018. When buying items or services on the exempt organization's behalf, the contractor must disclose that they are acting as the exempt organization's agent. Further, charges to the exempt organization must show the actual amount paid to suppliers. Texas Tax Policy News October 2018. Non-Exempt Lessors When the realty improved under a contract is owned by a non-exempt lessor, the contract will be treated as an exempt contract if:• the lessee of the realty is exempt under either Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.309 or Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.310;and • the term of the lease is sufficiently long in relationship to the life of the realty improvements made under the contract to ensure that the lessee will have the primary use and benefit of the improvements. See, e.g., Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201807006L (July 9, 2018) (denying the exemption where the improvements would have a useful life of 22 years, but where the exempt entity has the option to end the lease after 20 years and at the end of each fiscal year); Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201805021L (May 30, 2018) (contract is exempt where improvements to real property have a useful life of 22 years and exempt entity's lease is for 28 years); Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201805018L (May 30, 2018) (build-to-suit lease between a non-exempt lessor and an exempt lessee that has a lease term of 25 years and under which realty improvements with an expected useful life of 22 years are made qualifies as an exempt contract); accord Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201805019L (May 30, 2018) and Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201805020L (May 30, 2018); see also Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201508392L (Aug. 14, 2015); Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201509408L (Sept. 1, 2015); Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201509415L (Sept. 2, 2015); Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201509414L (Sept. 2, 2015); Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201509416L (Sept. 2, 2015); Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201509417L (Sept. 2, 2015); see also Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201509411L (Sept. 1, 2015) (build-to-suit lease between a non-exempt lessor and an exempt lessee that has a lease term of 30 years and under which realty improvements with an expected useful life of 22 years are made qualifies as an exempt contract); accord Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201509412L (Sept. 1, 2015); Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201509413L (Sep. 1, 2015); but see Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,817 (Sept. 19, 2016) (build-to-suit lease between a non-exempt lessor and an exempt lessee that has a lease term of 4 years and under which realty improvements with an expected useful life of 22 years are made does not qualify as an exempt contract because the lease term is not sufficiently long in relation to the life of the improvements; Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201711024L (Nov. 30, 2017) (denying the exemption where the improvements would have a useful life of 22 years but the exempt entity only had a 10 year lease).
