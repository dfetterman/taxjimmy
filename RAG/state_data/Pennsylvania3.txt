Topic: Utilities, Fuel, Mining and Natural Resource Extraction, Production, Sale Utilities Electricity

Depends The tax treatment of electricity depends on whether it is purchased for residential use. 72 Pa. Stat. §7201(m); 72 Pa. Stat. §7204(5). Nonresidential sales of electricity are taxable; however electricity is exempt when purchased for residential use. 72 Pa. Stat. §7201(m); 72 Pa. Stat. §7204(5); see also Spectrum Arena LP v. Pennsylvania (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2007) (overall purchase price of electricity includes delivery charges because generation and transmission of electricity must be bundled to reach customer, even though electricity technically delivered by an entity other than the vendor); Pennsylvania Informational Notice - Taxable and Exempt Property 16-1028 (identifying taxable and exempt utilities and fuel). However, it is important to note that in Aldine Apartments, Inc. v. Com., 426 A.2d 1118, 493 Pa. 480 (Pa. 1981), the Pennsylvania Supreme Court determined that a landlord's purchase of electricity for the use of his tenants is subject to sales tax due to the landlord's commercial interest in renting the units. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision Nos. 1518935, 1518934 (Oct. 4, 2016). 61 Pa. Code §32.25(d)(4)(iii) provides an exception for electricity resold to tenants through a metering device. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision Nos. 1603287, 1617798 (Jan. 26, 2017); see also Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1620896 (Aug. 29, 2017) (petitioner not entitled to residential exemption for purchases of bulk electricity because petitioner could not prove it resold the electricity to residents or that the consumption of the electricity was for anything other than petitioner's commercial interests in maintaining the retirement living facilities). Electricity billed to a condominium association representing taxpayers who owned their units was found to be purchased for residential use. Summit House Condo. v. Pennsylvania, 479 A.2d 1162 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1984). However, electricity purchased by an assisted living facility for its residents' use was not exempt, because the facility had a pecuniary interest in the residences, and the residents did not have any ownership interest in the property. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1704596 (March 6, 2018). Although an exemption certificate or equivalent documentation is required to claim the residential use exemption for fuel oil, kerosene, natural gas, and propane, a product delivered to a single residence and billed to an individual at that location is presumed to be residential and does not require documentation. 61 Pa. Code §32.25; Pennsylvania Informational Notice - Sales and Use Tax 2014-01 (Jan. 24, 2014). Overtime Usage Charges under a real property lease for overtime usage of HVAC systems are considered charges for utilities, and are thus subject to sales tax. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1705674 (May 15, 2018). Public Utility Exemption Tangible personal property, including machinery and equipment and supplies purchased for direct use in the production, delivery, or rendering of a public utility service, such as the manufacturing of electricity, are generally exempt from sales and use tax. Property used to maintain facilities directly used in producing, delivering, or rendering such services also qualify for this exemption. 72 Pa. Stat. §7201(k)(8)(ii)(C); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1600562 (Aug. 29, 2017) (equipment used to heat a public utility facility's natural gas for external frost prevention is exempt). However, tools and equipment used but not installed in the maintenance of these facilities are subject to tax. 61 Pa. Code §32.34(a)(3)(ii); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1604235 (March 6, 2017); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1604051 (March 6, 2017) (where board was unable to determine which items were installed in the maintenance of the facility). Machinery and equipment used prior to the rendering of the public utility are not considered “directly used” and do not qualify for the public utility exemption. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1520946 (Feb. 24, 2017). Examples of exempt items directly used in the manufacturing of electricity may include: process piping, valves with fittings and supports, wiring, conduit with fittings, concrete, grout, cable tray, suction diffusers with strainers, silencers, instrumentation, heat tracing, circuit breakers, and control panel supports. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1600461 (Sept. 26, 2016); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1600562 (Aug. 29, 2017) (special fill and grout used in the installation of utility lines are exempt). Sale for Resale Exemption The sale of electric energy is eligible for the sale for resale exemption, so long as the resale is made to a party subject to Pennsylvania gross receipts tax. Since municipalities in Pennsylvania do not pay gross receipts tax on sales of electric energy derived from business conducted within their municipal borders, an electric energy supplier cannot claim a resale exemption for energy sold to a municipality that resold this energy within its borders. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1626370 (July 25, 2017). BNA-SUTN PA 30.2.1.

Depends The mining exemption applies to the purchase of machinery and equipment used predominantly and directly in oil or gas extraction. Pennsylvania Informational Notice - Sales and Use Tax 2014-02 (Sept. 22, 2014). Water and coiled tubing and snubbing used in oil and gas hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”)qualify for Pennsylvania's mining exemption. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1519335 (Aug. 31, 2016). Natural gas compressor stations and items used to construct them, such as sub bases for the pad, fittings, turnbuckle aligners, insulation blankets, OSHA rebar caps, and tanks also qualify for the mining exemption. However, compression machinery and equipment must be used before the sale of gas in order to be exempt. For example, stations that pump natural gas through pipelines prior to sale are eligible for the exemption.

Depends Effective July 1, 2017, tangible personal property including machinery and equipment, parts for machinery and equipment, and supplies, purchased for direct use predominantly in timbering is exempt from sales and use tax. 72 Pa. Stat. §7201(k)(8), as amended by 2015 Pa. H.B. 1198, § 1 effective July 1, 2017; Pennsylvania Sales Tax Bulletin No. SUT 16-001 (July 21, 2016). The factors that determine whether property or services are directly used are the physical and temporal proximity of the property or services to the timbering operation, and the existence of an active causal relationship between the use of the property or services and the producing or harvesting of trees in the timbering operation. Pennsylvania Information Notice - Sales and Use Tax 2017-01 (Oct. 13, 2017). The term “timbering”includes the business of producing or harvesting trees from forests, woodlots or tree farms for the purpose of the commercial production of wood, paper or energy products derived from wood by a company primarily engaged in the business of harvesting trees. Timbering also includes:• all operations prior to the transport of the harvested product necessary for the removal of timber or forest products from the site; • in-field processing of trees into logs or chips; • complying with environmental protection and safety requirements applicable to the harvest of forest products; and • loading of forest products onto highway vehicles for transport to storage or processing facilities and postharvest site reclamation. 72 Pa. Stat. §7201(k)(8), as amended by 2015 Pa. H.B. 1198, §1 effective July 1, 2017. Timbering does not include the harvesting of trees for clearing land for access roads. 72 Pa. Stat. §7201(k)(8), as amended by 2015 Pa. H.B. 1198, §1 effective July 1, 2017. Prior to July 1, 2017, there was no exemption for sales of tangible personal property used in timbering. 72 Pa. Stat. §7201(k)(8). Additionally, the operation of a saw mill or planing mill as a business enterprise for the production of lumber or lumber products constitutes a processing activity to which Pennsylvania's processing exemption applies. 72 Pa. Stat. §7201(d)(8). For sales and use tax purposes, processing commences when the operator of the saw mill or planing mill unloads logs, timber, pulpwood, or other wood material to be used in the milling operation. 72 Pa. Stat. §7201(d)(8). There is no specific exemption for property used in the timbering or logging operations by which logs, timber, or the like are initially extracted from real property. 61 Pa.

However, not all purchased electricity qualifies for the exemption. For example, in Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1509444, a cable and telephone service-provider could not establish that it used electricity purchased predominantly and directly to provide a public utility or broadcasting service. The company operated a “converged network” that provided telephone, cable, and internet services simultaneously, but the Board of Finance and Revenue concluded that “internet services are not considered to be public utility services due to the adaptation of rules covering fixed and mobile broadband services by the FCC.” The company could not establish that it used property at least 50 percent to provide public utility services rather than internet services, so its purchases did not qualify as exempt. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1509444 (March 1, 2016); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1618782 (Aug. 29, 2017) (where petitioner who operated a converged network failed to establish that property at issue was used to provide voice services, a public utility, rather than data services—a non-public utility). The Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue has also held that revenue sources alone are insufficient to establish predominant use in the case of converged networks. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1600168 (July 18, 2017). At times, Pennsylvania has broadly interpreted the term “public utility service.” In Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1600525, an electrical construction company successfully demonstrated that its purchase and installation of materials used to provide services necessary to construct a new parcel sorting and distribution facility was eligible for the public utility exemption. In that case, the parcel sorting and distribution facility itself was considered a public utility provider (of parcel delivery services to the general public), and the electrical construction company's provision of power to run the conveyor belts and scanners in the facility was sufficient to establish “direct use” in the rendering of that public utility service. The exempt purchases included circuit breakers and wire, conduit, and fittings, but not lighting fixtures, lamps, and lighting fixture supports. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1600525 (Sept. 26, 2016). Taxpayers should be prepared to explain how or in what capacity items purchased are directly used in the rendering of a public utility service. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1523453 (Sept. 26, 2016). This includes providing evidence such as detailed descriptions of items purchased, and affidavits from the purchaser describing how the purchases qualify for the claimed exemption. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1521040 (Dec. 12, 2016); see also Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1712368 (Dec. 12, 2017) (taxpayer provided adequate explanation of how purchases were used in providing public utilities services).
