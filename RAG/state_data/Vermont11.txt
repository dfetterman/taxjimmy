Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Use Tax

Yes Vermont also imposes on every person a use tax for the use of any taxable tangible personal property or services, including telecommunication services, on which sales tax was not collected. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, §9773, as amended by 2014 Vt. H. 884, effective July 1, 2014. Every seller of tangible personal property or services who holds a Vermont license and who makes sales of property and services, when the use of the tangible personal property or services is subject to tax, must collect the Vermont use tax from the purchaser at the time of the making of the sale. Vt. Code R. §1.9778; Crossman Plumbing & Heating v. Vermont Comr. of Taxes, 455 A.2d 799 (Vt. 1982). Use tax is collected on the retail sales price of the property or service. Manufacturers that convert property for personal or business use that would normally be sold at retail should calculate use tax on the best customer price when offered for sale. Use tax is due on the value of property and services consumed in the fabrication, printing, or imprinting of property that producer creates for self-use. Vermont Tax Fact Sheet FS-1018. The state use tax is typically paid by the purchaser of an item delivered to Vermont or used in Vermont subject to sales tax in Vermont where the sales tax has not been collected by the vendor of the item. Generally, use tax is due on purchases made in another state that does not impose sales tax or if the purchase is made from an internet vendor. Also, use tax is due where a vendor collects sales tax from the purchaser using a lower rate than Vermont's 6 percent rate, including where the vendor is located in another state. In this instance, the purchaser owes the difference between the two rates. Vermont Tax Fact Sheet FS-1035; Vermont Tax Fact Sheet FS-1018. BNA-SUTN VT 1.1.2.

Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Local Option Sales and Use Tax

Local Tax Authorized Vermont law provides that municipalities are authorized to impose a local option sales tax at the rate of 1 percent, on transactions that would be subject to the state sales tax (excluding tax on telecommunications). Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, §138(a); Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, §138(b); Vermont Tax Fact Sheet FS-1012. A corresponding local option use tax is not provided for by Vermont law, and therefore, a local use tax cannot be imposed by municipalities when the state use tax would apply. Vermont Tax Fact Sheet FS-1012. The municipalities may also impose a local option meals and alcoholic beverages tax, and a local option rooms tax, both at the rate of 1 percent. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, §138(a); Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, §138(b); Vermont Tax Fact Sheet FS-1012. Effective Oct. 1, 2016, the Town of Brandon will charge, collect, and remit a 1 percent sales tax, rooms tax, and meals and alcoholic beverages tax. 2015 Vt.

Vermont VTAX Connect - July 2018. For purposes of imposing local options taxes, municipalities are defined under Vermont law as cities, towns, and incorporated villages. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, §138(e); Vermont Tax Fact Sheet FS-1012. Municipalities must meet one of three requirements to be authorized to adopt the local option tax:• the education property tax rate in 1997 must have been less than $1.10 per $100,000 of equalized education property value; • the equalized grand list value of personal property, business machinery, inventory, and equipment is at least 10 percent of the equalized education grand list as reported in the 1998 Annual Report of the Division of Property Valuation and Review; or • the combined education tax rate of the municipality will increase by 20 percent or more in fiscal year 1999 or in fiscal year 2000 over the rate of the combined education property tax in the previous fiscal year. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, §138(a)(3). To impose the local sales tax, the majority of a municipality's legislative body must recommend that a local sales tax be enacted. Thereafter, the voters of the municipality may vote to assess local option taxes, at an annual or special meeting at which a majority of those present and voting approve such taxes. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, §138(b); Vermont Tax Fact Sheet FS-1012. BNA-SUTN VT 1.1.3.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Historical Information

Est. 1969 Vermont became the last (of the 45 states with a sales tax) to adopt a formal sales tax. Its general sales tax was enacted in 1969, at the rate of 3 percent. See Vermont Dept. of Taxes, Sales Tax on Services Study (Jan. 2016); Vermont Historical Society, Vermont History, Vol. 65, Nos. 1 and 2 (Winter/Spring 1997). Most of Vermont's transaction-like taxes, including the gasoline tax, cigarette tax, electric energy tax, alcoholic beverages tax, and meals and room tax, pre-date the general sales tax. In 1931, Vermont enacted an income tax. Early in the state's history, property taxes served as the principal source of revenue, from 1781 until 1882. The property tax remains a major source of revenue for local jurisdictions. Vermont Historical Society, Vermont History, Vol. 65, Nos. 1 and 2 (Winter/Spring 1997). Vermont's sales and use taxes are allocated to the general and education funds. Vermont Dept. of Taxes, About Vermont State Taxes. In its June 2014 annual financial report, the state noted that Vermont's combined personal income tax, sales and use tax, and Meals and Rooms Tax revenue accounted for 80.1 percent of the general fund.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Pending and Trending Developments

Services Expansion of the tax base to include the taxation of additional services is likely to become a major issue in Vermont over the next several years. Vermont Dept. of Taxes, Sales Tax on Services Study (Jan. 2016). In Jan. 2016, the Vermont Dept. of Taxes issued a “Sales Tax on Services Study,”addressing the fiscal impact of extending the sales and use tax to a broader range of consumer services, that is, those most commonly taxed by other states. Vermont Dept. of Taxes, Sales Tax on Services Study (Jan. 2016). The report was submitted to the state's House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance, in compliance with legislation requiring the Commissioner of Taxes to conduct a sales tax analysis of the short- and long-term economic impacts on Vermont of a extending the tax base, and projecting sales and use tax revenues in the absence of a change. The legislation explains the impetus for commissioning the study and report: “The General Assembly concludes that the structural deficiencies in Vermont's current revenue and budgeting structure, combined with a change in the State economy from an economy based on goods to an economy based on services, requires an examination and rethinking of Vermont's current sales tax base.” 2015 Vt. H. 489, §94(a), effective June 11, 2015; see Vermont Dept. of Taxes, Sales Tax on Services Study (Jan. 2016). Vermont's “Sales Tax on Services Study”reports on the number of states currently taxing a laundry list of services, and includes estimates of revenue generated from taxation of those services. The study ultimately identifies three potential categories for expanding Vermont's sales and use tax base to include more services:• services related to tangible personal property (automobile); • services related to tangible personal property (non-automobile); and • services not related to tangible personal property. Vermont Dept. of Taxes, Sales Tax on Services Study (Jan. 2016). As directed by the legislature, the study additionally provides a number of initial draft regulations, using the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement sourcing rules as a model, for the following services (and similar transactions), as a starting point for consideration:• repair, calibration, or maintenance of tangible personal property; • painting or refinishing tangible personal property, including motor vehicle painting or detailing; • washing or cleaning tangible personal property, including laundry or dry cleaning services, and motor vehicle washing services; • some veterinary services and animal grooming services; • holding tangible personal property for the consumer for a charge (with exceptions for services such as, parking a vehicle, as opposed to storage of a vehicle, or the boarding of an animal, essentially for care and feeding); • the short- and long-term holding of clothing for a consumer in a vault; • other bailment of personal property for which a fee is charged; • provision of a locker, self-storage unit, building, or other property, including real property, for the renter's use in storing tangible personal property; • provision of dry-dockage or out-of-water storage for watercraft; • provision of safe deposit boxes; • the holding or provision of space to keep a motor vehicle (but not simply parking); • airplane storage, of an aircraft at rest; • rental of clothing and accessories; • membership dues and initiation fees; • transportation services; • installation, repair or maintenance labor; • service contracts; • landscaping, lawn, and plant care services; • motor vehicle towing; • health and athletic club services; and • RV park and campground charges. Vermont Dept. of Taxes, Sales Tax on Services Study (Jan. 2016). As noted in the report, Vermont already taxes more services than the majority of its neighboring states. See Vermont Dept. of Taxes, Sales Tax on Services Study (Jan. 2016) (Vermont taxes more services than Massachusetts, Maine and Rhode Island, but fewer than New York and fewer than Connecticut—which appears to tax the highest number of services in the region). The legislature seems poised to find additional sources of sales tax revenue in light of modern consumption patterns. How constituents respond to the report's findings and any resulting proposals certainly will determine how expansive the tax base becomes. Other Developments Vermont's sales and use tax was expanded to include soft drinks, effective July 1, 2015. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, §9741(31), as amended by 2015 Vt. H. 489, effective June 11, 2015; Vermont Tax Fact Sheet FS-1080. Also effective July 1, 2015, a charge for the right to access remotely prewritten software is no longer considered a charge for tangible personal property, and thus, is not subject to sales tax. 2015 Vt. S. 138, effective July 1, 2015; Vermont Tax Fact Sheet FS-1084. Briefly, Vermont's history regarding sales taxation of remotely accessed prewritten software may be traced back to Sept. 2010 when the Department of Taxes issued Vermont Technical Bulletin TB-54 indicating that prewritten software is subject to tax regardless of how the software is accessed. TB-54 stated specifically that prewritten software licensed for use and available from a remote server is taxable. In 2012, the Vermont legislature enacted 2012 Vt. H. 782, which included a temporary moratorium on the enforcement of sales tax on prewritten software accessed remotely. The moratorium halted the assessment of tax on charges for remotely accessed software made between Jan. 1, 2007 and June 30, 2013. As the moratorium expired, the Department issued a bulletin indicating that purchases made since July 1, 2013 were taxable. Economic Nexus Vermont has enacted an economic nexus provision for remote retailers. The provision goes into effect July 1, 2018. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, §9701(9)(F)(ii), as amended by 2016 Vt. H. 873, §26, effective the later of July 1, 2017, or the first day of the first quarter after a controlling court decision or federal legislation abrogates the physical presence requirement of Quill Corp v. North Dakota; South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., 138 S. Ct. 2080, 2018 BL 219995 (U.S. 2018) (abrogating the physical presence requirement of Quill). BNA-SUTN VT 1.3.
