Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

True Object Test To determine whether a transaction is bundled, one must examine the true object of the transaction. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.190(4); Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.195(2). BNA-SUTN WA 9.3.1.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Bundled Transactions

Depends A bundled transaction generally is subject to sales tax if the retail sale of any of its component products would be subject to the tax. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.195(1). Bundled transaction means the retail sale of two or more products where: (i) the products are otherwise distinct and identifiable; and (ii) the products are sold for one nonitemized price. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.190(1); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 13-0059 (welding package comprised of many distinct products sold at one nonitemized total package price determined a taxable bundled transaction). The term does not mean the sale of real property and services to real property. Moreover, a bundled transaction excludes the sale of any products where the sales price varies or is negotiable, based on the products selected by the purchaser. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.190(1). Distinct and identifiable products do not include:• packaging, such as containers, bags, labels, and tags, and instruction guides that accompany the retail sale of products and are incidental or immaterial to the retail sale; Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.190(2)(a). • a product provided free of charge with the required purchase of another product; Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.190(2)(b). or • items included in the definition of sales price. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.190(2)(c). “One non-itemized price” does not include a price that is separately identified by product on binding sales or other supporting sales-related documentation made available to the customer in paper or electronic form, including, an invoice, bill of sale, receipt, contract, service agreement, lease agreement, periodic notice of rates and services, rate card, or price list. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.190(3). Non-Bundled Transactions A transaction that otherwise meets the definition of a bundled transaction may not be a bundled transaction if it is:• the retail sale of tangible personal property and a service where the tangible personal property is essential to the use of the service, and is provided exclusively in connection with the service, and the true object of the transaction is the service; Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.190(4)(a). But see Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0328R (Jan. 11, 2017)(installation of computer hardware is not essential to use or receive network service monitoring). • the retail sale of services where one service is provided that is essential to the use or receipt of a second service and the first service is provided exclusively in connection with the second service, and the true object of the transaction is the second service; Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.190(4)(b). • a transaction that includes taxable products and nontaxable products and the purchase price or sales price of the taxable products is de minimis; Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.190(4)(c). • the retail sale of exempt tangible personal property and taxable personal property where the transaction includes food and food ingredients, drugs, durable medical equipment, mobility enhancing equipment, over-the-counter drugs, prosthetic devices, or medical supplies; and where the seller's purchase price or sales price of the taxable tangible personal property is 50 percent or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled tangible personal property. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.190(4)(d). Sellers may not use a combination of the purchase rice and sales price of the tangible personal property when making the 50-percent determination. De minimis means the seller's purchase price or sales price of the taxable product is 10 percent or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled products. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.190(4)(c). Sellers must use either the purchase price or the sales price of the products to determine if the taxable products are de minimis. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.190(4)(c); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0328R (Jan. 11, 2017) (where the percentage cannot be calculated, the transaction does not qualify for the de minimus exception). In making a de minimis determination with regard to taxable property, the sellers must use the full term of a service contract. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.190(4)(c);Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0314 (Sept. 30, 2016) (de minimus provisions did not apply to services provided by a taxpayer because the transactions were listed as separately stated line items which showed the time and charge for each activity, thus allowing the auditor to tax each activity according to the nature of the activity.) If the price is attributable to products that are subject to tax at different tax rates, the total price is attributable to the products subject to the tax at the highest tax rate, unless the seller can identify by reasonable and verifiable standards the portion of the price attributable to the products subject to the tax imposed by Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.020 at the lower rate from its books and records that are kept in the regular course of business for other purposes including, but not limited to, nontax purposes. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.195. BNA-SUTN WA 9.3.2.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Local Jurisdictions, Taxability Distinctions

Conforms to State Unless otherwise noted, the various local sales and use taxes are imposed on tangible personal property and services that are taxed at the state level. Likewise, local exemptions are generally applied in the same manner and at the same time as state retail sales and use tax exemptions. Wash. Rev. Code §82.14.070; Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.020; Wash. Rev. Code §82.12.020; Wash. Rev. Code §82.04.050. The caveat being, cities may by resolution or ordinance, impose a use tax on every person for the privilege of using natural or manufactured gas in the city. Wash. Rev. Code §82.14.030(1). Typically, the use tax does not apply or a credit is provided if tax on the gas has already been paid. Wash. Rev. Code §82.14.230. BNA-SUTN WA 9.4.
