The use tax also is imposed on purchases by ultimate consumers of property purchased for the federal government. W. Va. Code §11-15A-2. Use tax is not imposed when:• the sales tax has already been paid; • the transaction is exempt from the sales and service tax; • the transaction is not subject to sales and service tax; and • a nonresident temporarily brings property into West Virginia for the person's own use. W. Va. Code §11-15A-3; W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-9.5. The purchase price is the measure of the use tax and has the same definition as sales price. W. Va. Code §11-15B-2(b)(46). Use tax does not apply to tangible personal property purchased outside of West Virginia for use outside of West Virginia by a nonresident. Moreover, tangible personal property used by a nonresident outside of West Virginia for six months or more and then brought into West Virginia in connection with moving a residence or business is exempt from use tax. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-9.7. A producer of natural resources or of manufactured products that uses or consumes these products in West Virginia is required to pay tax on the gross value of the resources or products used unless a specific exemption applies. W. Va. Code §11-15-7(a). A purchaser or lessor of property for use in another state that uses or consumes the same property in West Virginia is liable for tax on the value of the property used or consumed in the state. W. Va. Code §11-15A-2(a). Any wholesale or retail producer of natural resource products or manufactured products is obligated to collect the sales and service tax unless specifically exempted. W. Va. Code §11-15-7(a); W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-7.1. The West Virginia Legislature is authorized to impose tax on privileges, franchises, and income under the state constitution. W. Va. Const. art. X, § 10-1. The authority to tax extends to provisions aimed at satisfying state debt and annual expenses. W. Va. Const. art. X, § 10-5. The Department of Tax and Revenue and the Tax Commissioner of the State Tax Department are responsible for administering the sales and service tax and the use tax. W. Va. Code §11-10-5. The Tax Commissioner has the power to make rules and regulations and must publicly release all administrative decisions. W. Va. Code §11-10-5d(k). Further, the Tax Commissioner can issue Technical Assistance Advisories in response to a written request. W. Va. Code §11-10-5r. Taxpayers required to file a return for sales and service taxes or use taxes must file a combined return for both the sales and service taxes owed and use taxes owed. W. Va. Code §11-15-16. Provided that a retailer has a physical presence in West Virginia or any other presence that provides the necessary minimum contacts for a constitutionally sufficient nexus for the state to require such a retailer to collect and remit use taxes, retailers must collect use tax if they:• solicit orders from persons located in West Virginia via telecommunication or television shopping system which utilizes a telephone or mail ordering system, including toll free telephone numbers, reverse charge telephone systems or other telephone ordering systems and which is intended by the retailer to be broadcast by cable television or other means of broadcasting, to consumers located in West Virginia; • solicit orders from persons located in West Virginia by means of advertising that is broadcast from, printed at, or distributed from, a location in West Virginia if the advertising is primarily intended to be disseminated to consumers located in West Virginia and is only secondarily or incidentally disseminated to bordering jurisdictions; • solicits orders from persons located in West Virginia • have a franchisee or licensee operating in the state under the retailer's trade name; or • solicits orders from persons within West Virginia pursuant to a contract with a cable television operator in West Virginia. W. Va. Code §11-15A-6a. Planning Point: On June 21, 2018, the Supreme Court determined that the lack of physical presence no longer limits the imposition of sales and use tax remitting and collection obligations on out-of-state retailers. To date, West Virginia has not issued any guidance on the tax collection and remittance obligations of out-of-state sellers that lack a physical presence in West Virginia. South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., 138 S. Ct. 2080, 2018 BL 219995 (U.S. 2018); Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 298 (1992), overruled by South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., No. 17-494, 2018 BL 219995 (U.S. June 21, 2018); Natl. Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 386 U.S. 753 (1967), overruled in part by South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., 138 S. Ct. 2080, 2018 BL 219995 (U.S. 2018). Retailers with nexus are required to collect the vendor's use tax from purchasers as taxes accrue. The tax due on a cash sale accrues when the sale is consummated. The tax due on a sale of services accrues at payment. W. Va. Code §11-15-3. BNA-SUTN WV 1.1.2.
