Topic: Administration and Procedure Payment Methods Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)

Required for Certain Taxpayers New Jersey requires taxpayers that had a prior year tax liability of $10,000 or more to remit payments due for sales and use taxes to the Department of Treasury by Electronic Funds Transfer. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:48-4.1. Taxpayers making payments by electronic funds transfer that know there are insufficient funds to cover the transfer are committing a crime. The degree of the crime is dependent on the amount by which the transfer is insufficient. N.J. Rev. Stat. §2C:21-5, as amended by 2014 N.J. A. 1153, effective Sept. 10, 2014. If a taxpayer's prior year liability results in the taxpayer having to comply with EFT requirements, the taxpayer will be provided with notice of the requirement. N.J. Admin. Code tit. 18, §2-3.6. Notice must be received within 30 days prior to the required compliance date; however, failure to receive notice will not relieve a taxpayer from the EFT requirement. Instead, the Division may consider the lack of notice when considering a request for waiver of penalties or interest that may be imposed under N.J. Admin. Code tit. 18, §2-3.8 for the failure to pay by EFT. N.J. Admin. Code tit. 18, §2-3.7. BNA-SUTN NJ 31.6.1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Certificates Required

Yes Requirements A seller is relieved from the obligation to collect tax on a sale for which an exemption certificate, which the purchasers name, address, registration number, and reason for exemption, is provided. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-12(b). Retention Periods Any taxpayer required to collect tax generally must keep records of all purchases and sales and the tax payable thereon for a period of four years following the period for which a sales and use tax return is filed for such sales. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-16. Accordingly, sellers are required to maintain exemption certificates for four years from the date of the last transaction under the exemption certificate. N.J. Admin. Code tit. 18, §24-2.5; N.J. Admin. Code tit. 18, §24-10.5. Consequences of Failing to Obtain Exemption Certificates If the seller either has not obtained an exemption certificate, has obtained an incomplete exemption certificate, or the seller has not obtained the relevant data elements (please see below), the seller will have at least 120 days after the Division's request for substantiation of the claimed exemption to obtain a fully completed exemption certificate from the purchaser, taken in good faith, which means that the seller obtains a certificate that claims an exemption that:• was statutorily available on the date of the transaction in the jurisdiction where the transaction was sourced, could be applicable to the item being purchased, and is reasonable for the purchaser's type of business;or • obtain other information establishing that the transaction was not subject to tax. N.J. Admin. Code tit. 18, §24-10.4(d). If the seller obtains this information, the seller will be relieved of any liability for the tax on the transaction, unless it is discovered through the audit process that the seller had reason to know the information was materially false. It is the Division's responsibility to prove this knowledge. N.J. Admin. Code tit. 18, §24-10.4(e). Exemption Certificate Substitutions, Data Elements In order for an exemption certificate to be “fully completed” it must contain:• the purchaser's name and address; • the type of business; • the reason(s) for the exemption; • the purchaser's New Jersey tax identification number, federal employer identification number or out-of-state registration number for out-of-state purchasers, or driver's license number for individual purchasers; and • if a paper exemption certificate is used (including facsimile), the purchaser's signature. N.J. Admin. Code tit. 18, §24-10.4(c). Additionally, where a purchaser provides a seller with an affidavit, statement, or other evidence required by the Director demonstrating that the purchaser is an exempt organization, the seller is relieved from the obligation to collect tax on the sale for which such proof of exemption is provided. If neither an exemption certificate nor adequate proof to the effect that a purchaser is an exempt organization is provided in connection with a sale, the sale will be deemed a taxable retail sale on which the seller must collect tax.

Stat. §54:49-6(b); N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-27(c); N.J. Admin. Code tit. 18, §2-2.9(c).

Civil fraud occurs when there is clear and convincing evidence of the taxpayer's intent to commit fraud by evading or avoiding the payment of taxes known to be due through conduct intended to conceal, mislead, or otherwise prevent the administration and collection of the taxes imposed. Intent does not include inadvertence, reliance on incorrect technical advice, honest difference of opinion, negligence, or carelessness. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:49-9.1; N.J. Admin. Code tit. 18, §2-2.9.

Rev. Stat. §54:48-4.1 et seq. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-21(a); New Jersey Sales Tax Publication ANJ-1. A final determination by the conference and appeals branch can also be appealed to the Tax Court. N.J. Admin. Code tit. 18, §32-1.1;N.J. Div. of Taxn., Protest and Conference Guidebook (October 2017). The appeal provided by N.J. Rev.

N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-21(b) All Tax Court complaints must be filed within 90 days after the date of the action that the taxpayer is requesting to be reviewed. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:51A-14(a). The 90-day period is calculated from the date of service of the decision or notice of the action. The timely mailing rule under N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:49-3.1, which applies to protests mailed to the division of taxation does not extend to complaints filed with the Tax Court. See Smart Publ'ns, LLC v. New Jersey, 2016 BL 107799 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2016) (complaint was received by the Tax Court 95 days after the date of service; even though it was mailed on the due date, it had to be received within the 90-day period, so the complaint was dismissed). A protest to the Director or an appeal to the Tax Court from the sale of tax indebtedness may be brought only on the ground that the underlying indebtedness was not fixed and final at the time of the sale, or that there was a technical ministerial error in the certificate of debt, including, but not limited to, incorrect identification of taxpayer, insufficient notice of certificate of debt, incorrect calculation of unpaid balance of a debt paid in part or in full. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:48-4.1; N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-21; N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:50-29; N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:49-18. A taxpayer who challenges the underlying indebtedness after the tax debt has been sold has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the State's claim was not fixed and final at the time of sale. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:48-4.1; N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-21; N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:50-29; N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:49-18. In any appeal by a taxpayer to the Tax Court challenging the underlying tax indebtedness, made pursuant to N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:50-29 et seq., the Director of the Division of Taxation is the primary party in interest, and the purchaser of the lien shall also be joined with the Director as a defendant. Such challenge must first have been brought to the Director by protest under N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:49-18. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:48-4.1; N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-21; N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:50-29; N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:49-18. Notwithstanding the purchaser's joinder in any action or proceeding brought to challenge the underlying indebtedness, the Director has the sole authority to determine, in the case of a protest, and advocate, in the case of an appeal, whether the matter is fixed and final, whether the Certificate of Debt is correct and properly entered, and whether and to what extent any relief should be afforded to the taxpayer. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:48-4.1; N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-21; N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:50-29; N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:49-18. BNA-SUTN NJ 31.17.
