Exempt Pennsylvania sales and use tax is imposed only on the sale or use of non-exempt tangible personal property and certain enumerated services. Consequently, the purchase of real property is not subject to tax. See 72 Pa. Stat. §7202(a); 72 Pa. Stat. §7202(b). To determine whether property is nontaxable as real property, it is necessary to determine whether the property at issue constitutes real property or if originally considered tangible personal property, whether it has been affixed to real property in such a way as to lose its identity as tangible personal property. There is no bright-line test that decisively separates real property from tangible personal property, leaving a lot of real property in a gray area on the cusp of the two categories. See 61 Pa. Code §31.11; Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision Nos. 1625387, 1707503, 1707505 (March 6, 2018) (installation of cabling in the walls, hot water tank repairs, and the installation of four panic buttons were exempt construction activities); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1516270 (Aug. 31, 2016); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1503954 (Aug. 26, 2016); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1502115 (Aug. 26, 2016). The Pennsylvania Department of Revenue has provided some guidance on what items of tangible personal property will be presumed either to be or not to be affixed to real property such that they become a permanent part of the real property, thereby losing their identity as tangible personal property. See 61 Pa. Code §31.11; Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1511709 (June 6, 2016) (where property has wiring installed in ceiling, installation constitutes nontaxable construction or repairs to real property). For instance, boilers, burglar alarm systems, and car wash equipment are, when incorporated into real property, presumed to become part of the real property. On the other hand, file cabinets, utility scales, and shelving are presumed not to become part of real property. 61 Pa. Code §31.11; see Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1512367 (June 6, 2016) (repairs to a water softener system taxable as repairs to tangible personal property rather than real property); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1426211 (June 6, 2016) (property must be installed permanently in order for services to said property to constitute a nontaxable construction contract). The Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue has ruled that the installation of well pads or compressor pads constitute nontaxable construction activities. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1522466 (Jan. 31, 2017). It has also ruled that when sufficiently affixed the installation of outdoor signage constitutes a nontaxable construction activity. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1523300 (Jan. 31, 2017); see also Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1608950 (Feb. 24, 2017) (the removal of signage also constitutes a nontaxable construction activity). Over the years, Pennsylvania courts have used various approaches in analyzing this issue. In some instances, courts have applied a “facts and circumstances” analysis, rather than relying on or setting forth a rigid multi-factor test. For instance, in the case of Pennsylvania v. Beck Electric Construction, Inc., the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania extemporaneously addressed a number of factors in determining the character of property installed upon real property. Pennsylvania v. Beck Elec. Constr., Inc., 485 Pa. 604, 403 A.2d 553 (Pa. 1979) (this case used an old definition of the term use which has since been superseded by statute). Among the factors the Court considered were the following: the extent to which the property installed would retain its functional integrity if removed; the ease with which the property could be installed; the portability of the property; and the extent to which removing the property would cause damage to the real property upon which it was installed. Pennsylvania v. Beck Elec. Constr., Inc., 485 Pa. 604, 403 A.2d 553 (Pa. 1979). More recently, Pennsylvania courts have begun to follow a multipart test in determining whether chattels constitute real property or tangible personal property. This multi-part test begins by placing property in one of three classes. Ne. Pa. Imaging Ctr. v. Pennsylvania, 978 A.2d 1055 (Pa. Commw. Ct.2009). The first of these classes consists of “furniture and similar items” not affixed to real property, which are always classified as tangible personal property. In the second class are items affixed to a building or land such that they cannot be removed without damaging the building or land. Items in this second class are always classified as real property. In the third class are items affixed to real property that can be removed without damaging the real property or the items. Property falling in this class may constitute either tangible personal property or real property. Where property falls within this third class, a court will proceed to weigh the following factors to determine its character as either tangible personal property or real property:• the manner and extent of affixation; • the extent to which the affixed property is essential to the use of the property to which it is attached; and • the intention of the parties affixing the property that it becomes a permanent part of the real property to which it is affixed. Northeastern Pa. Imaging Ctr. v. Pennsylvania, 978 A.2d 1055 (Pa. Commw. Ct.2009). But see Pennsylvania Letter Ruling No. SUT-04-005 (Feb. 5, 2004) (stating the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue's position that the “intention of the parties” is irrelevant to the characterization of property for sales and use tax purposes); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1425398 (June 6, 2016) (generator retains its identity as tangible personal property after installation such that installation is not an exempt construction contract).

Depends There is no bright-line test that decisively separates real property from tangible personal property and much property lies in a gray area on the cusp of the two categories. See 61 Pa. Code §31.11; Northeastern Pa. Imaging Center v. Pennsylvania, 978 A.2d 1055 (Pa. Commw. Ct.2009). However, in 61 Pa. Code §31.11, Pennsylvania lists several items that are presumed to become a permanent part of real estate upon installation. It also sets out items that, in the absence of satisfactory evidence to the contrary, are presumed to keep their identity as tangible personal property after installation. See Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1519773 (Dec. 20, 2016) (generators remain tangible personal property despite hard wiring and the fact that relocating would cause structural damage to realty). But see Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1520615 (Dec. 20, 2016) (denying taxpayer's claim for an exemption on installation and repair of items such as an HVAC system, despite the fact that heating and ventilation systems are presumed to be affixed to realty). Pennsylvania uses the term “fixture”to refer to items of tangible personal property that lose their identity as tangible personal property when affixed to real property. See 61 Pa. Code §31.11.

Depends Pennsylvania does not treat the sale and installation of all appliances, electronics, machinery, and equipment as tangible personal propertyper se . See 61 Pa. Code §31.11; Ne. Pa. Imaging Ctr. v. Pennsylvania, 978 A.2d 1055 (Pa. Commw. Ct.2009). However, in 61 Pa. Code §31.11, Pennsylvania lists several items that are presumed to become a permanent part of real estate upon installation. It also sets out items that, in the absence of satisfactory evidence to the contrary, are presumed to keep their identity as tangible personal property after installation. 61 Pa. Code §31.11 For example, the code specifies that appliances that are not built-in are presumed not to become a permanent part of real estate upon sale and installation. 61 Pa. Code §31.11 Parking Lots The paving of a parking lot is considered an exempt construction activity. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1711211 (Jan. 23, 2018). Cabling The installation of cabling is considered a tax-exempt service to real property when the cabling is installed in a manner that it becomes a fixture to the real property. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision Nos. 1705112, 1705113 (March 8, 2018); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1513910 (May 16, 2017). Similar items, such as data lines, are exempt when installed such a manner that they become affixed to real property. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1620559 (Dec. 12, 2017). Generally, these items are considered affixed to real property if they are installed behind the walls. See Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1703047 (Jan. 23, 2018) (purchase and installation of cabling was not exempt because evidence did not show it was installed behind walls). Audio Visual Equipment The installation of audio visual equipment is not considered a construction service. Audio visual equipment is not considered affixed to real property, and retains its character as tangible personal property upon installation. See Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision Nos. 1612276, 1614704, 1614705 (June 23, 2017); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision Nos. 1621565, 1623466, 1623467 (June 23, 2017).

Exempt Signs that are permanently affixed to real property are considered realty, such that repairs to or installation of permanently affixed signs are considered exempt repairs to real property. See Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision Nos. 1520955, 1602128 (May 9, 2017) (installation of channel letters on the outside of buildings was an exempt construction activity); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1711633 (May 7, 2018) (installation of neon signage was a nontaxable construction activity); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1516469 (June 6, 2016); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1512912 (June 6, 2016); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1417439 (July 1, 2016); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1511137 (July 19, 2016). Examples of exempt signs include pole signs, pylon signs, and illuminated box signs affixed to the outside of a building; pole and panel signs; monument signs; and time and temperature displays. See Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision Nos. 1619047, 1619049, 1619050 (Jan. 30, 2018); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1619973 (Dec. 12, 2017); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1604906 (July 18, 2017). Charges for repairs to exempt signs are also exempt. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1629761 (Jan. 23, 2018). However, interior signage and wall plates (with employee names, for example) constitute tangible personal property. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1600725 (Dec. 20, 2016).Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1512912 (June 6, 2016); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1512404 (June 6, 2016) (sign is sufficiently annexed to real estate such that installation of sign is a nontaxable construction activity); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1510389 (June 6, 2016) (where contractor cut walls and installed electrical work necessary for illumination of signs, signs are sufficiently annexed to realty such that their installation constitutes an exempt construction activity); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1417439 (July 1, 2016) (installation of signage (store letters) constitutes a nontaxable construction activity or repair to realty); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1511137 (July 19, 2016) (construction or repair of monument sign constitutes a nontaxable construction activity or repair to realty); see also Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1613920 (Feb. 24, 2017) (distinguishing between exempt services to signs and nonexempt services to signs). Traffic signs and window graphics do not constitute signs permanently affixed to realty upon installation. Depending upon the method of installation, pylon signs, channel letters, electronic messaging centers, time and temperature signs, and aluminum banners may be found to be permanently affixed to real property. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision Nos. 1610386, 1615949 (April 3, 2017); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1603268 (Dec. 12, 2016); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1600328 (Nov. 2, 2016); see Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1723783 (May 7, 2018) (directional sign could be shown to be permanently affixed if it were wired for electricity); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision Nos. 1627224, 1630251 (July 18, 2017) (where relief for other signage specifically excluded enter and exit signs). Outdoor billboards are considered permanently affixed to realty upon installation.

Depends Although items listed in 61 Pa. Code §31.11 are presumed to become part of real estate once installed, the presumption can be rebutted if these items are rented, and not owned. See 61 Pa. Code §31.11; Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1521478 (Sept. 2016). According to the Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue, it would be reasonable to conclude that rented items are not sufficiently affixed to the realty to become a permanent fixture.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Construction Materials and Contracts Construction Materials and Contracts, Generally

Nontaxable Charges for construction labor billed to a contractee are not subject to sales and use tax in Pennsylvania. 61 Pa. Code §31.6; 61 Pa. Code §31.12; Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1524557 (July 13, 2016). A construction contractor generally must pay sales and use tax on its purchase of materials, equipment, components, supplies, and tools that it uses to perform construction activities. 72 Pa. Stat. §7201(o)(17); 61 Pa. Code §31.6(a)(5); 61 Pa. Code §31.12(a)(1); 61 Pa. Code §31.13(a); see Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1524010 (July 13, 2016). Erection and dismantling of scaffolding is a taxable rental of tangible personal property, not a nontaxable service. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1507063 (June 6, 2016); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1602831 (Aug. 26, 2016). Property used by construction contractors in the construction, reconstruction, remodeling, repair, and maintenance of real estate including, buildings, roads, structures, and bridges, for or on behalf of the Commonwealth or its political subdivisions, is subject to tax. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1413785 (Dec. 12, 2016). Construction Activities Construction activities include the service or repair of real estate and the affixation of tangible personal property to real estate such that it becomes a permanent part of the real estate. 61 Pa. Code §31.11; Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1511392 (July 13, 2016) (repairs, furnishing, and installation of underground plumbing systems and electrical equipment, removal, furnishing, and installation of cooling towers and sensors constitutes nontaxable construction activities); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1522590 (Jan. 31, 2017) (the fixing of a sinkhole constitutes a nontaxable construction activity). Items that are presumed to become a permanent part of real estate include wall air conditioners, alarm systems, and wallpaper. 61 Pa. Code §31.11; Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1512886 (June 17, 2016) (bolting industrial racks to the floor does not render them sufficiently attached to real estate so as to become a permanent part thereof); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1520274 (June 6, 2016) (installation of polymer coating on fixture constitutes construction contraction); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1517617 (July 13, 2016) (the construction or repair of door locks is presumed to be a construction activity); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1523543 (Feb. 24, 2017) (locksmith services are exempt as nontaxable construction services); see 61 Pa. Code §31.11 for a comprehensive list of items presumed to become a permanent part of the real estate. The nature of a contractor's obligation to remit sales tax on the purchase of materials depends on the characterization of the activities performed by the contractor as either construction activities or sales activities. 61 Pa. Code §31.12. More information on the taxation of construction contractors is available at 1840 T.M., State Taxation of Construction Contractors. Contractors are required to pay tax on the purchase price of all property that they furnish and install in the performance of construction activities. 61 Pa. Code §31.12(a)(1); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1523520 (Aug. 26, 2016). Contractors must also pay tax on all tools and equipment, such as backhoes, cranes, saws, drills, and vehicles that are used but not transferred in connection with their construction activities. 61 Pa. Code §31.12(a)(3). Charges for services constituting “construction activities” are, however, not subject to tax. 72 Pa. Stat. §7201(k)(4); 72 Pa. Stat. §7201(o)(4). A contractor that limits its activities to construction must pay sales tax directly to its vendor at the time of purchase. 61 Pa. Code §31.12(a)(2). When purchasing items from a vendor that is not licensed to collect sales tax, such contractors must self-assess and remit use tax directly to the state. 61 Pa. Code §31.12(a)(2). Construction contractors are required to pay tax upon the purchase price of materials, equipment, and supplies which they furnish and install. Contractors who perform taxable services in repairing and altering tangible personal property are deemed to be vendors and required to collect and remit sales tax. 61 Pa. Code §31.12. Contractors that manufacture, mine, process, or grow materials that are consumed during construction activities are liable for use tax based on their acquisition cost of the raw material purchased to produce the consumed property. 61 Pa. Code §31.12(c)(2). Contractors are exempt from sales tax on purchases of items (e.g., machinery, equipment) that are used in contracts for manufacturers, provided the items are directly used in the manufacturing process and would have been exempt if purchased by the manufacturer. See Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision Nos. 1616984, 1616985 (May 9, 2017); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1616911 (May 9, 2017). Beginning Jan. 1, 2020, the sale at retail of building materials and supplies used for the construction or repair of an animal housing facility is exempt from sales and use tax, regardless of whether the sale is made to the purchaser directly or made pursuant to a construction contract. Prior to Jan. 1, 2020, such sales are taxable. 72 Pa. Stat. §7204(72), as amended by 2019 Penn. H.B. 262, effective Jan. 1, 2020; Pennsylvania State Tax Summary: July 2019. Sales Activities “Sales activities”include activities under which a contractor, pursuant to an agreement or contract, installs tangible personal property so as not to become a permanent part of real estate. 61 Pa. Code §31.11; Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1522301 (Aug. 26, 2016) (installation of blinds/shades constitute taxable sales activities). Contractors that, in addition to performing construction activities, make sales at retail of tangible personal property (i.e., perform “sales activities”), will be deemed to be a vendor of such tangible personal property and must register with the state to collect sales tax. 61 Pa. Code §31.12(b)(1). Receipts from repairing tangible personal property or installing such property as a replacement part of other personal property are subject to sales tax. 61 Pa. Code §31.12(b)(2). Further, charges for labor or transportation in conjunction with the sale at retail and installation of tangible personal property are subject to tax even when the labor or delivery charges are separately stated on a bill, invoice, or similar document. 61 Pa. Code §31.12(b)(3). Thus, if items of tangible personal property are affixed to real property, the contractor will pay tax and the contractee does not. However, if items are not affixed, then the contractor can purchase the tangible personal property for resale, and the contractee will have to pay tax to the contractor. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1605391 (Dec. 12, 2016). Construction Clean Up Charges for post-construction clean up services are considered taxable building maintenance and cleaning. These services are taxable even if performed by the same entity who performed the associated construction. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1711922 (Jan. 23, 2018). Public Utility Providers The purchase of items directly used to render public utility services are specifically exempt from sales and use tax. 61 Pa. Code §32.34; Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1704917 (April 10, 2018) (discussing direct use requirement); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1610128 (May 9, 2017) (purchases used in installation of sanitary sewer systems and in electric and gas mail trenching exempt); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1504308 (April 11, 2017) (equipment and tools used for repair or reconstruction of public utility facilities is exempt, but equipment and tools used for maintenance are not exempt); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1614177 (April 2, 2017) (purchase of pipes, valves, fittings, meter vaults, and pump supports for a water utility was exempt); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1514549 (Nov. 4, 2016); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1605369 (Sept. 26, 2016) (purchases of material used to construct power and communication distribution equipment for electricity and telephone services exempt from sales and use tax); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1502608 (Aug. 11, 2016) (taxpayer, an international energy service company, was entitled to a refund for tax paid on its purchase of construction or repair equipment used to repair public utility facilities). However, taxpayers should be prepared to explain how or in what capacity items purchased are directly used in the rendering of a public utility service. See Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision Nos. 1700174, 1702759 (Jan. 30, 2018) (denying refund when taxpayer failed to establish that specific items were used directly by the public utility in the rendition of public utility services); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1523453 (Sept. 26, 2016). This includes providing evidence such as detailed descriptions of items purchased, full contracts for the job in question, and affidavits from the purchaser describing how the purchases qualify for the claimed exemption. See Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1610133 and Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1610134 (May 9, 2017) (refund denied for transactions for which no contract was provided); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1521040 (Dec. 12, 2016); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1520111 (Nov. 2, 2016) (petitioner did not provide a certificate from any state or federal government, among other things, to prove it provides a public utility service). Further, the exemption is limited to the purchase of property that the contractor transfers to and is subsequently used directly by the public utility. The contractor is required to obtain certification from the exempt public utility stating that the property, upon installation, will be directly used by the exempt customer in its public utility. 61 Pa. Code §31.13(c); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1513990, 1515713 (Nov. 2, 2016). Keystone Opportunity Zone Pennsylvania's Board of Finance and Revenue has rendered decisions indicating that construction contractors engaged in construction activities for qualified businesses operating under economic development programs, may be exempt from paying sales and use tax on the machinery, equipment, and services purchased or rendered if the property or services are exclusively used by the qualifying business within the approved economic development area, and in some cases, if the qualifying business is treated as an exempt entity. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1604248 (July 13, 2016) (taxpayer granted sales and use tax refund for the purchase of circuit breakers, disconnect switches, luminaires, junction boxes, fuses, thermostats, wiring, conduit, fittings raceway, a transformer vault, fasteners, gravel, communication systems equipment, cabling, and testing services that were used pursuant to a construction contract, and subsequently transferred to, a business participating in the Keystone Opportunity Zone program and for which a certificate of exemption and a valid exemption number were provided); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1600209 (July 13, 2016) (taxpayer granted sales and use tax refund for the purchase of rentals of cranes with operators, scissor lifts, boom lifts, forklifts, utility vehicles, light tower, construction trailer, 20- and 40-foot storage containers, and dyed diesel fuel that were exclusively used pursuant to a construction contract, and subsequently transferred to, a business participating in the keystone opportunity zone program and for which a certificate of exemption and a valid exemption number were provided); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1426183 (July 13, 2016) (taxpayer granted partial sales tax refund for the purchase of gym equipment, portable radio units, and repair services for communication devices that were transferred to and exclusively used by a business participating in the keystone opportunity zone program); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1600462 (Sept. 26, 2016).

There is an exception for items listed in 61 Pa. Code §31.11, which, in the absence of satisfactory evidence to the contrary, are presumed to become a permanent part of real estate once installed. Charges for repair parts and services to these items, therefore, are nontaxable as construction activities once they have become a permanent part of the real estate. 61 Pa.

Traffic signalization equipment is exempt building machinery and equipment when sold to a qualifying exempt organization under a construction contract. However, poles used for traffic signals are taxable. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision Nos. 1615061, 1616472 (May 9, 2017); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision Nos. 1800059 (May 7, 2018) (transformers and lamps are exempt, however poles are not). Some elements of “plumbing termination”qualify as building machinery and equipment, such as fire hydrants. However, drains, grates, benches, bike racks, ADA tactile panels, pedestrian rails, shoulder rails, tool balancers, and gorbel cranes installed in connection with plumbing termination do not. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision Nos. 1615061, 1616472 (May 9, 2017); see Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1711211 (Jan. 23, 2018); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision Nos. 1703778 1715949 (Dec. 12, 2017).

Planning Point: The type of work being performed is not sufficient to establish that the work involved the repair to real property. Invoices should give details about the specific work performed in order to substantiate not paying tax on the sale of repair services. In one case, a taxpayer's claim for refund of taxes paid on real property repair was denied because the invoice was not sufficiently detailed to determine whether the repair was to real property or tangible personal property, despite the fact that the invoice was for plumbing repairs. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1511916 (Dec. 12, 2016); see Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision Nos. 1705112, 1705113 (March 8, 2018) (“repairs to door” insufficient description to determine taxability); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1711922 (Jan. 23, 2018) (board unable to determine whether “repairs to automatic doors” were services to real property).

A contractor may not claim an exemption on his purchase of materials, supplies, equipment or parts that he installs so as to become a permanent part of the real estate in conjunction with the construction activities. Contractors must pay sales and use tax on materials they consume while providing their services. 61 Pa. Code §31.13. Examples of materials generally considered to be consumed during a construction project include: paint, coatings, washers, and bolts. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision Nos. 1518698, 1605763 (Oct. 7, 2016). Financial Institution Security Equipment Pennsylvania provides an exemption for the sale of financial institution security equipment that is also installed by the seller or seller's designee. This transaction is considered a construction contract. Security equipment that does not require installation is considered a “straight sale” and is subject to tax as the transfer of tangible personal property. See Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1616833 (Aug. 29, 2017); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1613160 (May 9, 2017) (security camera installation and repair involve the taxable purchase of or services to tangible personal property); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1609832 (May 9, 2017); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1518134 (Dec. 12, 2016). In order to qualify for the exemption, the institution must meet the definition of “financial institution” for purposes of the sales and use tax. A qualifying “financial institution”maintains a place of business within Pennsylvania, and is a corporation or association such as a bank, bank and trust company, savings bank, mutual banking association, savings and loan association, finance company, credit union, or similar institution. Trading firms generally do not qualify as financial institutions. 61 Pa. Code §46.9(b); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1628730 (June 23, 2017). Examples of qualifying financial institution security equipment include vaults, night depositories, cash lockers, and ATMs. See Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision Nos. 1716753, 17168770 (April 16, 2018); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1708323 (April 3, 2018).

Stat. §7201(aa); 72 Pa. Stat. §7201(k)(14); 61 Pa. Code §60.1(a). The performance of building repair services on buildings or other property that is permanently affixed to realty are not taxable. 72 Pa. Stat. §7201(aa); 61 Pa. Code §60.1(b)(1).
