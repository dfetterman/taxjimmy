Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

True Object In certain circumstances, Utah now uses the true object test in determining the taxability of certain transactions that are not “bundled transactions.” Utah Code Ann. §59-12-10(18)(b)(iv). A bundled transaction does not include the retail sale of tangible personal property and a service, when the tangible personal property is essential to the use of the service and is provided exclusively in connection with the service, and the service is the true object of the transaction. Presumably, such a transaction is taxable if the sale of the service that is the true object is taxable. though, because the tangible personal property is essential to the use of the service and provided exclusively in connection with the service, the true object, most likely, in such a transaction always will be the service, considering that the customer would want the tangible personal property only because it facilitates the receipt of the service.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Bundled Transactions

Taxable When a bundled transaction is a sale of both taxable and nontaxable products, services, or tangible personal property, the entire transaction is subject to tax, unless the vendor is able to identify by reasonable and verifiable standards the part of the charge that should not be subject to sales tax. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-103(2)(d)(iii)(A). If a bundled transaction is a sale of products, services, or tangible personal property that are subject to sales tax at different rates, the entire transaction is subject to sales tax at the highest rate unless the vendor can identify by reasonable and verifiable standards the part of the charge that should be subject to sales tax at a lower rate. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-103(2)(d)(iii)(B); see Utah Publication No. 25. Utah sales and use tax law defines a bundled transaction as the sale of two or more distinct and identifiable items of tangible personal property, products, or services for one non-itemized price. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-102(19)(a)(i), as renumbered by 2019 Utah S.B. 168, effective Oct. 1, 2019; Utah Code Ann. §59-12-102(19)(a)(ii), as renumbered by 2019 Utah S.B. 168, effective Oct. 1, 2019. Bundled transactions do not include the sale of any products when the price is variable, with the price being determined based on selections of products made by the consumer. Additionally, bundled transactions do not involve real property or services to real property. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-102(19)(b)(i), as renumbered by 2019 Utah S.B. 168, effective Oct. 1, 2019; Utah Code Ann. §59-12-102(19)(b)(ii), as renumbered by 2019 Utah S.B. 168, effective Oct. 1, 2019; Utah Code Ann. §59-12-102(19)(b)(iii), as renumbered by 2019 Utah S.B. 168, effective Oct. 1, 2019. A transaction otherwise satisfying the definition of a bundled transaction will not be considered a bundled transaction if it is any of the following:• A retail sale of tangible personal property and a service when the tangible personal property is essential to the use of the service, and the tangible personal property is provided exclusively in connection with the service, so long as the true object of the transaction is the service; Utah Code Ann. §59-12-102(19)(b)(iv), as renumbered by 2019 Utah S.B. 168, effective Oct. 1, 2019. • A retail sale of two services when one service is essential to the use or receipt of a second service, the first service is provided exclusively in connection with the second service, and the true object of the transaction is the second service; Utah Code Ann. §59-12-102(19)(b)(v), as renumbered by 2019 Utah S.B. 168, effective Oct. 1, 2019. • A transaction that includes taxable products and nontaxable products, and the purchase price or sales price of the taxable products is de minimis, i.e., ten percent or less of the total price of the bundled products; Utah Code Ann. §59-12-102(19)(b)(vi), as renumbered by 2019 Utah S.B. 168, effective Oct. 1, 2019. or • A retail sale of exempt tangible personal property and taxable tangible personal property when the transaction includes food and food ingredients, drugs, durable medical equipment, mobility enhancing equipment, over-the-counter drugs, prosthetic devices, or medical supplies, and the vendor's or seller's purchase price or sales price of the taxable tangible personal property is 50 percent or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled tangible personal property. Vendors and sellers may not use a combination of the purchase price and sales price of the tangible personal property when making the 50 percent determination for a transaction. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-102(19)(b)(vii), as renumbered by 2019 Utah S.B. 168, effective Oct. 1, 2019. The Utah State Tax Commission has ruled that membership fees for digital product services such as downloading movies, TV shows, music, and e-books are taxable as a bundled transaction. Utah Private Letter Ruling No. 16-005 (Aug. 9, 2017). Bundled Transactions That Include Food For a bundled transaction comprising food and food ingredients, and tangible personal property other than food and food ingredients, Utah imposes tax on the entire transaction at the generally applicable rate. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-103(2)(d)(i). See 2017 Utah S.B. 119, effective retroactively to Jan. 1, 2017 (amending various local sales and use tax provisions to clarify that the local tax is imposed on the purchase price and sales price of amounts paid or charged for food and food ingredients sold as part of a bundled transaction).
