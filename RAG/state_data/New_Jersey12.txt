None New York/New Jersey Cooperative Interstate Tax Program (rescinded in 2010) New Jersey is not currently a member of any other interstate agreement. However, prior to Aug. 17, 2010, New Jersey participated in the New York/New Jersey Cooperative Interstate Tax Program, which was a simplified sales tax reporting program that permitted the two states to exchange sales and use tax information. New Jersey Sales Tax Publication ANJ-14; New York TSB-M-88(12)S (Oct. 17, 1998); New York TSB-M-86(6)S (March 6, 1986); New York Publication 750. The program allowed vendors from New York with no business presence in New Jersey, but who made taxable sales of tangible personal property or services that were delivered to persons in New Jersey, to collect the New Jersey sales tax due on those sales. New Jersey Sales Tax Publication ANJ-14; New York TSB-M-88(12)S (Oct. 17, 1998); New York TSB-M-86(6)S (March 6, 1986); New York Publication 750. Key aspects of the now obsolete simplified sales tax reporting program were that:• each registered vendor collected tax on items shipped to the other state at the rate specified by the state and locality to which the goods were delivered, even though the vendor had no business location in the neighbor state; • a vendor filed a return only in the state in which the vendor was located; • upon filing a return, each state remitted to the other state the funds that it collected for its neighbor; • vendor participation in the program was voluntary; and • a registered vendor was only subject to a single audit.
