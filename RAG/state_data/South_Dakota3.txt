Taxable South Dakota imposes sales tax on the gross receipts from selling, furnishing, or servicing natural or artificial gas, including the gross receipts from those sales by a municipal corporation. S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §10-45-6; S.D. Admin. R. 64:06:03:13; see also S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §10-45-1(14) (identifying gas as tangible personal property). Utility connection and reconnection services are also taxable. S.D. Admin. R. 64:06:03:13. Rural Electric Cooperatives Some South Dakota municipalities have rural electric cooperatives rather than municipally owned electric systems. South Dakota allows those municipalities to tax the rural electric cooperative's gross receipts. The maximum permissible percentage varies depending on whether the rural electric cooperative serves a minority or majority of the municipality. In either case, the tax must be “at an amount to be agreed upon” by the rural electric cooperative and the municipality. See S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §49-34A-45 (minority service); S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §49-34A-46 (majority service); see also S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §10-45-12.4. If the rural electric cooperative serves a minority of the municipality, then the municipality may impose up to a 2 percent tax on the rural electric cooperative's total yearly gross revenue. S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §49-34A-45. However, if the rural electric cooperative serves a majority of the municipality, then the municipality may impose up to a 4 percent tax. S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §49-34A-46. If the rural electric cooperative and municipality fail to agree on a tax percentage by May 1, then the percentage defaults to 2 or 4 percent, respectively. S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §49-34A-45 (minority service); S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §49-34A-46 (majority service). Effective July 1, 2015, the rural electric cooperative may pass the tax on to consumers. South Dakota does not consider the resulting revenue to be gross receipts if the rural electric cooperative states the revenue separately on the invoice, bill of sale, or similar document. S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §10-45-1.19, as amended by 2015 S.D. S.B. 136, effective July 1, 2015; see also S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §49-34A-45 and S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §49-34A-46, as amended by 2015 S.D. S.B. 136, effective July 1, 2015 (adding language to clarify that the rural electric cooperative may pass the tax on to consumers, and that the revenue is not gross receipts if stated separately).
