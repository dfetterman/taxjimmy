Nontaxable Sales of real property are not subject to Utah sales tax. Charges for labor performed on real property also are not taxable. Utah Admin. Code §R865-19S-58(2); see Utah Private Letter Ruling No. 04-019 (Mar. 29, 2005) (sales of real property are nontaxable). When tangible personal property becomes part of the underlying real property, a transaction to purchase and install the tangible personal property is considered a nontaxable sale of real property. Utah Private Letter Ruling No. 04-019 (Mar. 29, 2005). The sale of a completed home is not subject to tax. However, sales of materials and supplies to the contractor for use in building the home are taxable as construction materials sold to the final consumer, i.e., the contractor. Utah Admin. Code §R865-19S-58(2). Real Property Contrasted With Tangible Personal Property Utah sales and use tax statutes do not define “real property.” In distinguishing between real property and tangible personal property, the Utah Tax Commission indicates that real property, realty, or real estate is:• any right, title, estate, or interest in land including all minerals located in, on, or under the land; • all buildings, fixtures, and improvements to the land that are permanently attached; • all water rights, rights-of-way, rents, issues, profits, income, tenements, inherited property, claims(including mining claims), and privileges belonging to, used, or enjoyed with the land or any part of the land. Utah State Tax Comn., Utah Sales and Use Tax Information; see Utah Publication No. 25. Under Utah's sales and use tax act, “tangible personal property” means personal property that may be seen, weighed, measured, felt, touched, or is any manner perceptible to the senses. “Tangible personal property”includes electricity, water, gas, steam, and prewritten computer software, no matter how the prewritten software is transferred. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-102(129), as renumbered by 2019 Utah S.B. 168, effective Oct. 1, 2019; Utah Publication No. 25. Tangible personal property does not include real estate or any interest or improvements in real estate that become a permanent part of the real estate. Utah State Tax Comn., Utah Sales and Use Tax Information; Utah Publication No. 25. Generally, sales of tangible personal property are subject to sales and use tax. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-103(1)(a).

Utah State Tax Comn., Utah Sales and Use Tax Information. Under Utah's sales and use tax act, “tangible personal property” means personal property that may be seen, weighed, measured, felt, touched, or is any manner perceptible to the senses. “Tangible personal property”includes electricity, water, gas, steam, and prewritten computer software, no matter how the prewritten software is transferred. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-102(129), as renumbered by 2019 Utah S.B. 168, effective Oct. 1, 2019; Utah Publication No. 25. Tangible personal property does not include real estate or any interest or improvements in real estate that become a permanent part of the real estate. Utah State Tax Comn., Utah Sales and Use Tax Information; Utah Publication No. 25. Generally, sales of tangible personal property are subject to sales and use tax. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-103(1)(a). For purposes of Utah's sales and use tax, three possible classifications may apply to tangible personal property installed on real property:• it may become part of the underlying real property; • it may be tangible personal property permanently attached to real property;or • it may remain tangible personal property not permanently attached to real property. See e.g., Utah Private Letter Ruling No. 04-019 (Mar. 29, 2005). An item of tangible personal property generally will fall within the second classifications, i.e., tangible personal property permanently attached to real property, if the following criteria are met:• the attachment of the item is essential to the use of the item and indicates that the item will remain attached for its useful life; and • the item is “affixed in a manner that facilitates removal without substantial damage to the real property or to the item itself.” Utah Code Ann. §59-12-102(88)(a), as renumbered by 2019 Utah S.B. 168, effective Oct. 1, 2019; Utah Admin. Code §R865-19S-58(4)(c); Utah Publication No. 25. In several cases, the Utah Supreme Court has considered a list of factors when determining whether personal property becomes part of real property on installation. Nine factors are considered:• whether the property is removable without harm to the structure on which it is placed; • whether the property is manufactured with the idea that it could be used elsewhere; • whether the parties to the transaction contemplated that the property would be removed for repairs or replacement; • whether the primary purpose of the transaction was the property or the installation of the property; • whether the installation was for convenience; • whether the transaction indicated that the property was to be treated as real property after installation; • whether the purchaser intended to purchase real property; • whether the property becomes inseparably meshed into a greater facility that is the object of the transaction; and • whether the property becomes attached to real property. See Utah Administrative Decision 13-488 citing to Utah Supreme Court decisions in Chicago Bridge & Iron Co. v. Utah State Tax Comn., 839 P.2d 303 (Utah 1992), B-J Titan Svcs. v. Utah State Tax Comn., 842 P.2d 822 (Utah 1992), Nickerson Pump & Machinery Co. v. Utah State Tax Comn., 361 P.2d 520 (Utah 1961). Sales of items that are installed but do not become part of real property are subject to tax. Examples of items that remain tangible personal property even when attached to real property are:• moveable items that are attached to real property merely for stability or for an obvious temporary purpose; • manufacturing equipment and machinery and essential accessories appurtenant to the manufacturing equipment and machinery; • items installed for the benefit of the trade or business conducted on the property that are affixed in a manner that facilitates removal without substantial damage to the real property or to the item itself; and • telephone or communications equipment and associated wire and lines if the equipment, wire, and lines are provided as part of a single transaction; that are part of real property are an incidental portion of the transaction;are primarily used for the operation of a telephone system or a communications system; are installed for the benefit of the trade or business conducted on the property; and are attached to real property in a manner such that their removal from the real property does not cause substantial damage to the equipment, wire, or lines or to the real property to which they are attached.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal Sale and Installation of Appliances, Electronics, Machinery, and Equipment

Depends Fixtures(e.g., furnaces, built-in air conditioning systems, hot water heaters, sinks, and tubs) become part of real property after installation because they are an essential part of real property improvement. These items are generally treated as construction materials, and thus, their sales to the contractor are subject to tax if the contractor or repairer converts the tangible personal property to real property. Utah Admin. Code §R865-19S-58(1); Utah Publication No. 42. The contractor or repairer who converts tangible personal property to real property is the ultimate consumer, whether the contract is a lump-sum, time and material, or a cost-plus contract, and whether the contract is performed for an individual, religious or charitable institution, or a governmental entity. Utah Admin. Code §R865-19S-58(2)(a)-(b); Utah Publication No. 42. A furnish-and-install contract provides an example of personal property converted to real property. Under a furnish-and-install contract, a seller converts tangible personal property to real property, and consequently becomes a real property contractor. The seller-turned-contractor is the last person to own the materials as tangible personal property. Thus, the seller-contractor must pay sales tax on the purchase of the materials. The transaction between the seller-contractor and the real property owner is not taxable. If, however, the real property owner purchases construction materials for use by a third-party contractor, the property owner pays the sales tax, not the contractor. Utah Publication No. 42. The following items are examples of tangible personal property considered permanently attached to real property:• a television antenna or satellite dish, even if it is attached to a house and its wiring is dropped inside; • property attached to oil, gas, or water pipelines; and • manufacturing machinery and trade fixtures when the attachment is essential for the operation of the equipment and when removal of the equipment will cause substantial damage to the equipment or the real property. Utah Publication No. 42. Property does not lose its classification as permanently attached to real property if it is temporarily detached for repair or renovation, so long as the repair or renovation is performed on the real property. Any other detachment, however, causes the property to be regarded as tangible personal property. Property is also not considered permanently attached to real property if the tangible personal property is attached only for convenience, stability, or for an obvious temporary purpose. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-102(88), as renumbered by 2019 Utah S.B. 168, effective Oct. 1, 2019; Utah Publication No. 42. The following remain tangible personal property and are not considered permanently attached even if the item is affixed to real property:• a dishwasher; • a dryer; • a freezer; • a microwave; • a refrigerator; • a stove; • a washer; • items similar to those listed above, as determined by Utah regulations;or • manufacturing equipment and trade fixtures attached for convenience, stability, or an obviously temporary purpose. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-102(129)(c), as renumbered by 2019 Utah S.B. 168, effective Oct. 1, 2019; Utah Publication No. 25; Utah Publication No. 42. In contrast, a hot water heater, a water filtration system, and a water softener system, are not considered tangible personal property, even when attached to real property only through a line that supplies water, electricity, gas, telephone, cable, or other similar item as determined by Utah regulations. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-102(129)(e), as renumbered by 2019 Utah S.B. 168, effective Oct. 1, 2019. Sales of fixtures or other items of tangible personal property, like furnaces, built-in air conditioning systems, hot water heaters, water softener systems, water filtration systems, sinks, tubs, or other items appurtenant to or incorporated in to real property and become an integral part of a real property improvement are taxable to the contractor or repairer that converts them to real property, the same as construction materials generally.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal Sale and Installation of Signage

Depends The taxability of the sale and installation of signage depends on whether the items retain their character as tangible personal property. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-103(1); Utah Administrative Decision 13-488 (Aug. 19, 2014). Utah examines nine factors to determine whether signage becomes part of real property. These factors are: 1) whether the property is removable without harm to the structure on which it is placed; 2) whether the property is manufactured with the idea that it could be used elsewhere; 3) whether the parties to the transaction contemplated that the property would be removed for repairs or replacement; 4) whether the primary purpose of the transaction was for the property or the installation of the property;5) whether the installation was for convenience; 6) whether the transaction indicated that the property was to be treated as real property after installation; 7) whether the purchaser intended to purchase real property;8) whether the property becomes inseparably meshed into a greater facility which is the object of the transaction; and 9) whether the property becomes attached to real property. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-103(1); Utah Administrative Decision 13-488 (Aug. 19, 2014). Signs that are permanently affixed to the ground where it is rare that a sign would be moved and, to do so, would destroy a significant portion of the sign and/or require significant repairs are generally considered real property. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-103(1); Utah Administrative Decision 13-488 (Aug. 19, 2014).

Sales of construction materials, such as lumber, bricks, nails, cement, or other items to a contractor or repairman are subject to Utah's sales and use tax if the contractor or repairman converts the materials or other items to real property. Utah Admin. Code §R865-19S-58(1); Utah Publication No. 42. The contractor or repairer is treated as the consumer of the items whether they are converted to real property under a lump-sum, time-and-material, or cost-plus contract. Utah Admin. Code §R865-19S-58(2)(a); Utah Publication No. 42. If the contractor or repairer purchases all materials and supplies from vendors who collect the Utah tax, no sales tax license is required, unless the contractor makes direct sales of tangible personal property in addition to the work on real property. If the contractor makes direct sales, a sales tax license must be obtained, and sales tax must be collected on sales of tangible personal property to final consumers. The contractor must accrue and remit tax on all merchandise bought tax-free and converted to real property. Books and records must be kept to account for both material sold and material consumed. Utah Admin. Code §R865-19S-58(3); Utah Publication No. 42. Construction Materials for Airports Two exemptions exist for sales of construction materials used for certain airports. First, purchases of construction materials on or after July 1, 2010, by, on behalf of, or for the benefit of an international airport are exempt from sales and use tax so long as the airport is located within a first class county and has a United States Customs office on premises. To qualify for this exemption, the construction materials must be clearly identified, segregated, and installed or converted to real property owned or operated by the international airport and located at the international airport. Utah Code Ann. §59-12-104(66). Also available is an exemption for purchases of construction materials on or after July 1, 2008, purchased by, on behalf of, or for the benefit of a new airport that is located in a second class county, so long as the airport is owned and operated by a city in which an airline is headquartered. To qualify for this exemption, the construction materials must be clearly identified, segregated, and installed or converted to real property that is owned or operated by the new airport, located at the new airport, and as part of the construction of the new airport.

==================================================

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Subcontractors

Depends Whether subcontractors owe sales tax on construction material often depends on if they merely install the construction material, or convert it into real property. Utah Private Letter Ruling No. 96-164 (Nov. 4, 1996). If a general contractor purchases construction materials, then resells these materials to a subcontractor who converts them to real property, the general contractor may purchase the materials tax-free for resale and must collect sales tax on the sale of the materials to the subcontractor. If, instead, the general contractor gives the materials to the subcontractor for installation, the general contractor is liable for tax on its purchase of the materials. Charges by a subcontractor to a contractor are taxable if the subcontractor is selling items of tangible personal property to the general contractor. For instance, if a subcontractor builds steel I-beams, then sells the I-beams to the general contractor before they are converted to real property, the sale between the subcontractor and general contractor is subject to tax. The general contractor, as the final consumer, is liable for the tax. Utah Private Letter Ruling No. 96-164 (Nov. 4, 1996). BNA-SUTN UT 28.6.

Taxable Contractors or repairers that convert construction materials, fixtures or other items to real property are generally treated as the consumer of the items whether the contract is performed for an individual, a religious or charitable institution, or a government entity. Utah Admin. Code §R865-19S-58(2)(b). However, sales of materials are considered made to religious or charitable institutions and, therefore, are exempt from sales and use tax, if:• the religious or charitable institution pays the vendor directly for the materials; or • the materials are purchased on behalf of the religious or charitable institution; materials are purchased on behalf of the religious or charitable institution if the materials are clearly identified and segregated and installed or converted to real property owned by the religious or charitable institution. Utah Admin. Code §R865-19S-58(2)(d). BNA-SUTN UT 28.7.
