Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Tangible Personal Property

Destination For purposes of determining applicability of the Idaho sales and use tax, retail sales in Idaho are generally sourced on a destination basis. Idaho Commission Decision Docket No. 24089 (Aug. 15, 2012). More specifically, Idaho sales and use tax will not apply to a sale of tangible personal property where a seller delivers the property outside the state, for use outside the state, through either a common carrier, United States mail, or seller's delivery service. It is not determinative that title to the goods passes in another state. As long as the goods are delivered into Idaho, the exemption does not apply, regardless of when and where title passes. Idaho Commission Decision Docket No. 24089 (Aug. 15, 2012). To qualify for this exemption, the seller must maintain records to support the exemption. Shipping data in the form of bills of lading, postal receipts, or invoices setting forth the out-of-state destination with adequate supporting documentation are all acceptable forms of evidence of out-of-state delivery. Idaho Code §63-3622Q; Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.092. BNA-SUTN ID 4.1.1.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Services

Depends Idaho does not provide general sourcing rules for services. However, sales of certain services are included in the definition of “retail sale,” and are thus sourced on a destination basis. Idaho Code §63-3609; Idaho Commission Decision Docket No. 24089 (Aug. 15, 2012). Idaho tax law relating to the sourcing of mobile telecommunications is in compliance with the federal Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act. Accordingly, the Idaho sales and use tax applies to wireless calls that are billed to a customer whose primary place of use is in Idaho, to the extent the services are associated with transmission that originate and terminate within Idaho or within any other state. 4 U.S.C. §§116–126. Therefore, with respect to sourcing, when mobile telecommunications services are provided to a customer whose place of primary use is located in Idaho and the charges are billed by or for the customer's home service provider, the services are deemed to be provided at the customer's place of primary use. A customer's place of primary use is generally either the residential address or the primary business street address of the customer, and must be a location within the licensed service area of the home service provider. 4 U.S.C. §§116. BNA-SUTN ID 4.1.2.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Credit for Tax Paid to Another Jurisdiction

Depends Idaho law provides that when tangible personal property subject to use tax has been subject to a general retail sales or use tax by another state in an amount equal to or greater than the amount of the Idaho tax, and evidence can be given of such payment, the property will not be subject to Idaho use tax. Idaho Code §63-3621(j). However, if the amount paid to the other state was less, the property is subject to use tax to the extent that the Idaho tax exceed the tax paid to the other state. Idaho Code §63-3621(j). BNA-SUTN ID 4.2.
