Exempt Connecticut does not impose sales or use tax on aircraft repair or replacement parts. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-412(76). Further, repair and replacement parts are also exempt when used in the “significant overhauling or rebuilding” of aircraft. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-412(76). “Significant overhauling or rebuilding” means an activity that results in a significantly greater service life than property undergoing the overhauling or rebuilding would have had in the absence of such overhauling or rebuilding, or significantly greater functionality within the original service life of the property. In other words, it means materially enhancing the value, use, life expectancy, strength or capacity of the property. This requires more than merely restoring the original functionality for the balance of the original service life, such as by correcting an existing defect or putting the property back in efficient operating condition.

Depends The purchase lease or rental of motor vehicles is generally subject to tax, unless an exemption applies. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-431; Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2016(19) (Jan. 6, 2017). However, the sale of a motor vehicle, by a non-licensed motor vehicle dealer or lessor, is not subject to sales tax. But use tax must be paid by the purchaser before obtaining an original or transfer registration from the Department of Motor Vehicles. If the vehicle is not registered immediately after the purchase, the purchaser must report the use tax liability on his or her income tax return. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-431; Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2016(19) (Jan. 6, 2017). A special rate of 7.75 percent applies to sales of motor vehicles for more than $50,000. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-408(1)(H)(i). High-mileage Vehicles Until July 1, 2010, motor vehicles with an EPA estimated city or highway gasoline mileage rating of at least 40 miles per gallon were not subject to tax. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-412(110). Purchase by Nonresident The purchase of a motor vehicle not registered in Connecticut by a nonresident is not subject to tax, provided the purchaser submits a declaration to that effect to the Commissioner. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-412(60). Casual Sales of Motor Vehicles In the case of a sale of a motor vehicle from someone other than a licensed motor vehicle dealer or lessor, the receipts from the sale are not to be included when calculating sales tax. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-431(a)(1); Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-426-16a. However, the purchaser must pay use tax on the total purchase price, subject to certain exemptions. Conn. Gen.

Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(2)(J). For purposes of tax due on periodic payments received for the leasing of tangible personal property, a transaction does not create a sale (where tax is generally due upfront when an item is sold) merely because it provides that the rental price is permitted or required to be adjusted under the rental agreement either upward or downward by reference to the amount realized upon sale or other disposition of the motor vehicle (i.e., terminal rental adjustment clause). Conn. Gen. Stat. §14-167a; Conn. Gen. Stat. §14-171; Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-426-25(a); 12-426-25(c); Bell Atl. Sys. Int'l, Inc. v. Bajorski, No. 543083 (Conn. Super. Ct., Aug. 29, 1995). Tax does not apply to any payment made by a lessee of a motor vehicle to a lessor for the purpose of paying the property taxes on any such vehicle under a lease that is otherwise subject to tax if such lease requires the lessee to pay such property taxes and if such property tax payment is separately stated. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-412(49). But see HVT Inc. v. Law, 16 A.3d 686 (Conn. 2011) (vehicle registration renewal fees paid by lessee are gross receipts to lessor). Beginning Jan. 1, 2018, Connecticut repealed the surcharge imposed on rentals of passenger motor vehicles or trucks for a period of less than 31 days. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-692, as amended by 2017 Conn. H.B. 7312, effective Jan. 1, 2018; Connecticut Special Notice SN 2017(10) (Dec. 21, 2017). Instead of paying the surcharge, rental companies may elect to charge individually itemized charges or fees on rentals of passenger vehicles or trucks for periods of less than 31 days. The charges and fees may include a vehicle cost recovery fee, airport access fees, or airport concession fees. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-692, as amended by 2017 Conn. H.B. 7312, effective Jan. 1, 2018; Connecticut Special Notice SN 2017(10) (Dec. 21, 2017). Prior to Jan. 1, 2018, passenger motor vehicles or rental trucks rented within Connecticut by a rental company to a lessee for a period of less than 31 days were subject to a surcharge of 3 percent. The rental surcharge was imposed on the total amount the rental company charges the lessee for the rental of a motor vehicle. The surcharge was in addition to any tax otherwise applicable to any such transaction and shall be includable in the tax base for sales and use tax purposes. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-692(b), prior to amendment by 2017 Conn. H.B. 7312, effective Jan. 1, 2018. Companies that rent pieces of machinery are still subject to the surcharge. Connecticut Special Notice SN 2017(10) (Dec. 21, 2017). Connecticut imposes a Tourism Fund Surcharge on the rental or lease of a passenger motor vehicle for a period of up to 30 consecutive days. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-665. The surcharge is $1 for each day (or portion of a day), up to 30 days, for which the lessor charges the lessee for the rental or lease of a passenger motor vehicle. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-666(a). BNA-SUTN CT 29.3.1.

Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Motor Vehicles, Intrastate or Non-Commercial Use Repair and Replacement Parts

Taxable Motor vehicle repair parts are subject to sales and use tax. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-407(2)(i)(M)-1(c). Parts Purchased by Service Providers Sales of repair parts to a service provider who uses the parts in rendering motor vehicle repair services are sales for resale to such provider if, when used, such parts or materials become an “integral part” of the motor vehicle. As such, the purchase of the integral part will be taxable to the purchaser of the services. Service providers are considered the consumers of any non-integral parts. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-407(2)(i)(M)-1(c). An “integral part” means a part that retains its separate identity even after being incorporated into a repaired motor vehicle. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-407(2)(i)(M)-1(a)(3). Examples of integral parts include an air or oil filter, alternator, battery, belt, hose, muffler, spark plug, tire or windshield wiper blade. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-407(2)(i)(M)-1(a)(3). However, the term “integral part”does not include materials that do not retain their separate identity after being used to repair a motor vehicle, but are consumed by the service provider in repairing the motor vehicle. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-407(2)(i)(M)-1(a)(3)(B). Examples of those materials include abrasives(e.g., sandpaper, emery paper and grinding wheels), acetylene, acrylic finishes, applicators, body putty, body work tools, brushes, cleaners, compound pads, drop cloths, enamels, flux, hand cleansers, lacquers, lead, masking tape, masking paper, mechanics’ tools, metal conditioners, oxygen, paint, painting tools, plastic filler, polishing and buffing pads, primers, removers (liquid and paste), resins (e.g., epoxy, polyester, fiberglass cloth and fiberglass matting), rollers, rubbing compound, rustproofing liquid, sealants, shellacs, solder, spray guns, stain, stencils, strainers, thinners and solvents, undercoating, varnish, waxes, welding rods and disposable or reusable wipes. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-407(2)(i)(M)-1(a)(3)(B).

Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-412(80). Volkswagen/Audi Diesel Car Buyback and Settlement Program: Connecticut residents that own 2.0-liter TDI-engined Volkswagen and Audi models may be entitled to receive cash for the “buyback”of their vehicle pursuant to theVW diesel buyback and settlement program, established pursuant to a court-approved settlement agreement between the automaker and the U.S. Department of Environmental Protection. According to the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services, a buyback amount received by a purchaser pursuant to the program that is applied toward the purchase of another vehicle will not be entitled to a trade-in credit under Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-430(4). Connecticut sales and use tax will be due on the purchase price of the replacement vehicle, including the buyback amount. Connecticut Dept. of Rev. Svcs., Media Release: VW/Audi Diesel Car Buyback is Not a Trade-In (Oct. 11, 2016). Alternatively, under the same settlement program, an individual may also elect to keep their vehicle and have its emissions software modified. Under these circumstances, there will be no sales and use tax liability for the vehicle owner. Connecticut Dept. of Rev.

However, sales of tires to a service provider who uses the tires in rendering motor vehicle repair services are sales for resale and therefore exempt if such materials become an integral part of the motor vehicle. In other words, a service provider that replaces tires on vehicles, transferring the tires to its customer, may purchase the tires for resale and exempt from sales and use tax. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-407(2)(i)(M)-1(c).
