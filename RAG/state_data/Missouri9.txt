Enumerated Services Only Missouri imposes its sales and use tax on a very limited list of enumerated services. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.010.1(8). In Missouri, services are taxable only if they form a part of the selling price of tangible personal property sold in a retail sale subject to sales or use tax or if they are specifically taxable by statute. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.020; Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.010.1(8) (“sale”defined to include the rendering of designated services). Even if a person provides a nontaxable service, that person may be liable for sales and use tax on the cost of the cost of materials that he used to perform the service. Missouri Letter Ruling LR9944. Expansion Prohibited On Nov. 8, 2016, Missouri voters approved a ballot initiative that amends the state's constitution to prohibit the imposition of state and local sales and use taxes, or similar transaction-based taxes, on any service or transaction that was not already subject to tax on Jan. 1, 2015. Mo. Const. art. X, §26, as amended by state ballot initiative effective Nov. 8, 2016. The following services are the only services subject to tax:• providing electricity, electrical current, water and gas, to domestic, commercial, or industrial users; Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.020.1(3). • providing local and long distance telecommunications service; Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.020.1(4). • providing telegraph service; Mo. Rev. Stat. § 144.020.1(5). • providing rooms, meals, and drinks by a hotel, motel, inn, restaurant, drugstore, dining car, camp, or other place that regularly provides such services to the public; Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.020.1(6); Food Serv. Consultants Inc. v. Missouri Dir. of Rev., 55 S.W.3d 363 (Mo. 2001); see also Missouri Letter Ruling LR755 (Nov. 21, 2016);Missouri Letter Ruling LR7437 (Nov. 17, 2014) (stating that a mandatory service charge and administration fee for a wedding catering event were included in the taxable sales price, despite being separately stated). and • providing transportation by rail, car, bus, boat, or airplane to passengers in intrastate commerce. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.020.1(7); see also Oklahoma Tax Comn. v. Jefferson Lines, Inc., 514 U.S. 175 (1995); Cook Tractor Co., Inc. v. Missouri Dir. of Rev., 187 S.W.3d 870 (Mo. 2006). BNA-SUTN MO 9.2.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

True Object Test The taxablility of transactions involving the sale of both taxable tangible personal property and nontaxable services is determined by the “true object” test if the charges are not stated separately. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-103.600(1). Transactions that involve the sale of tangible personal property and nontaxable services are taxed only on the amount of the tangible personal property if the sale of each is separately stated. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-103.600(1). True Object Test If the true object of the transaction is the transfer of tangible personal property, then the entire sales price is taxable. Bartlett Intl., Inc. v. Missouri Dir. of Rev., 487 S.W.3d 470, 2016 BL 142306 (Mo. 2016); W. Blue Print Co. v. Missouri Dir. of Rev., 311 S.W.3d 789, 2010 BL 88839 (Mo. 2010); Sneary v. Missouri Dir. of Rev., 865 S.W.2d 342 (Mo. 1993); Gutknecht v. Missouri Dir. of Rev., 867 S.W.2d 709 (Mo. Ct. App. 1993). Conversely, if the true object of the transaction is the sale of the nontaxable service, then none of the sale price is taxable. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-103.600(1); see Missouri Letter Ruling LR7632 (Sept. 16, 2015) (amounts received for scanning customers' documents into a digital form and providing CD-ROMs containing those files at the end of the process are not subject to tax; the “true object”of taxpayer's business is selling the scanning service, not providing the CD-ROMs as tangible personal property). True object is defined as the real object the buyer seeks in making the purchase. The essentials of the transaction determine the true object. The true object is personal property if:• the purchaser desires and uses the tangible personal property; Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-103.600(2)(C)(1). • the tangible medium is not merely a disposable conduit for the service or intangible personal property; Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-103.600(2)(C)(2). • the tangible personal property is a finished product; Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-103.600(2)(C)(3). or • the tangible personal property is not separable from the service or intangible property. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-103.600(2)(C)(4). The true object is the service or intangible personal property if the tangible personal property is merely the medium of transmission for an intangible product and can be discarded after the purchaser has obtained access to the intangible component. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-103.600(2)(D). With respect to charges for shipping, handling, minimums, gratuities and other similar charges, if the purchaser is required to pay for the service as part of the sale price of tangible personal property, the entire sale price is subject to tax. If the purchaser is not required to pay the service charge as part of the sale price of tangible personal property, then the amount paid for the service is not subject to tax if the charge for the service is separately stated. If the charge for the service is not separately stated, the entire sale price is subject to tax. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-103.600(3)(A). If an amount paid by a customer for repair or personal service is separately stated from the tangible personal property used to perform the repair or personal service, then the amount paid for the repair or personal service is not subject to tax. If the amount paid for the repair or personal service is not separately stated, then the entire sale price is taxable. However, if the retail price of the tangible personal property constitutes less than 10 percent of the total sale price, then the department will consider none of the sale price as taxable, provided that the sales tax is paid on the purchase of the tangible personal property. In this situation, the seller must pay tax on the purchase of the tangible personal property. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-103.600(3)(B); Missouri Letter Ruling LR6595 (Jan. 20, 2011). For all other types of transactions, if a purchaser obtains a service as part of a transaction in which the true object is the purchase of tangible personal property, then the entire sale price is taxable even if the charge for the service is separately stated. If the purchaser obtains tangible personal property as part of a transaction in which the true object of the transaction is the purchase of a service, then none of the sale price is taxable unless the charge for the tangible personal property is separately stated. If the charge for the tangible personal property is separately stated, then only the charge for the tangible personal property is taxable. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-103.600(3)(C). Taxability does not depend on whether the parties intended the charge for the service to be part of the sales price;taxability depends on whether the parties intended the provision of the service to be part of the sales transaction. The legislature intended the charge for the service to be taxable if the service is part of the sale. Alberici Constructors, Inc. v. Dir. of Rev., 452 S.W.3d 632, 2015 BL 7099 (Mo. 2015); Missouri Letter Ruling LR7776 (Feb. 1, 2017). A person selling tangible personal property to a retailer of a nontaxable service must collect and remit tax on the sales. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-103.600(3)(D). When a service provider also sells tangible personal property in transactions that are separate from the provision of services, the sales of tangible personal property are subject to tax. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-103.600(3)(E). The applicability of an exemption, such as the “in commerce” exemption for sales between states, will not alone overcome the true object test. An exemption seeker must establish that any exempt portion of a mixed transaction is the true object of the sale, and not merely incidental. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.030.1; TracFone Wireless, Inc. v. Missouri Dir. of Rev., 514 S.W.3d 18, 2017 BL 45357 (Mo. 2017) (where the sale of local access to telecommunications services in Missouri is considered a retail sale, and is therefore not eligible for the “in commerce” exemption for sales between states). BNA-SUTN MO 9.3.1.

Taxable When an exempt item is sold together with taxable merchandise for one nonitemized price, the full price is subject to sales tax unless the price of the exempt item is separately stated. Missouri Letter Ruling LR7375 (Mar. 25, 2014). BNA-SUTN MO 9.3.2.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Local Jurisdictions, Taxability Distinctions

Differs from State Although local sales and use taxes generally conform to the state, there are several exceptions. See e.g., Mo. Rev. Stat. §32.087(5). The local sales and use tax generally parallels the state sales and use tax; however, Missouri's sales tax exemptions in Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.054.2 do not apply to local sales tax. Mo. Rev. Stat. §32.087(5); Mo. Rev. Stat. §32.087(7); Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.054.2; Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.757(3); Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.757(4); see, e.g., Missouri Letter Ruling LR7716 (June 9, 2016) (granite slabs used in granite counter tops are exempt from state—but not local—sales tax). Further, domestic utilities are exempt from state sales tax; however, they may be subject to local sales tax. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.032. Generally, exemptions that are granted to agencies of government, organizations, persons, and certain articles of tangible personal property and taxable services by the state, are also exempted from local sales and use taxes. Mo. Rev. Stat. §32.087(8). Any local tax imposed will become effective on the first day of the second calendar quarter after the director of revenue receives notice of the adoption of such tax. For more information on local taxes in Missouri see Missouri's Local Government Tax Guide. Mo. Rev. Stat. §32.087(2). All sales, except the sale of motor vehicles, trailers, boats, and outboard motors, are sourced to the locality where the retailer's business is located, unless the tangible personal property is delivered to an out-of-state destination. Mo. Rev. Stat. §32.087(12)(1); Missouri Letter Ruling LR7774 (Jan. 5, 2017). If the retailer has more than one place of business in the state, the transaction is deemed to have taken place where the initial order is taken. Mo. Rev. Stat. §32.087(12)(1). Alternatively, all sales of motor vehicles, trailers, boats, and outboard motors are sourced to the purchaser's residence. Mo. Rev. Stat. §32.087(12)(2). Further, taxes on sales of motor vehicles, trailers, boats, and outboard motors are not collected and remitted by the seller, but are collected by the director of revenue when application is made for the certificate of title. Mo. Rev. Stat. §32.087(13). When an error is made, sourcing the sale to the residence of the purchaser, (i.e. the purchaser pays a lower tax due to incorrect sourcing), the purchaser is liable for the difference due on the correct local tax. Missouri Administrative Decision 12-1250-RV (April 2013); Missouri Administrative Decision 12-1570-RV (April 18, 2013). All other provisions which govern the state sales and use tax also apply to the collection of any local sales and use taxes. Mo. Rev. Stat. §32.087(5); Mo. Rev. Stat. §32.087(7); Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.757(3); Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.757(4). College Bookstore Sales Sales by institutions of higher education in retail establishments, including bookstores, are subject to sales tax. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.513. However, textbooks that are required or recommended for postsecondary school studies are exempt from state, but not local, sales and use tax when purchased by a student. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.517. Expansion Prohibited Like Missouri's state level sales and use taxes, local sales and use taxes are prohibited from being expanded. In a Nov. 8, 2016, ballot initiative, Missouri voters approved an amendment to the state's constitution prohibiting the imposition of state and local sales and use taxes, or similar transaction-based taxes, on any service or transaction that was not already subject to tax on Jan. 1, 2015. Mo. Const. art. X, §26, as amended by state ballot initiative effective Nov. 8, 2016. BNA-SUTN MO 9.4.
