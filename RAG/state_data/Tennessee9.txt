Depends Tennessee levies a sales tax on the provision within the state of enumerated services. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-205(c) as added by 2007 Tenn. S.B. 2223, §75, effective Jan. 1, 2008. Taxable services include, but are not limited to, telecommunications, repair services, laundering or dry cleaning, grooming services for animals, installation, certain charges for the enrichment of uranium materials, certain charges for providing space to vendors without permanent locations in Tennessee, and certain charges for warranty or service contracts. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-205 as amended by 2019 Tenn. H.B. 931, effective April 12, 2019 (extending Tennessee's compliance with SSUTA until July 1, 2021). See Tennessee Letter Ruling No. 08-23 (March 12, 2008) (answering service not subject to sales tax because services not taxable telecommunications services). See also Tennessee Letter Ruling No. 16-07 (Sept. 8, 2016) (fees for computer support services are not specifically enumerated, and therefore not taxable); Tennessee Dept. of Rev., What Services are Subject to Sales and Use Tax in Tennessee (Jan. 6, 2017).

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

True Object Tennessee has adopted the true object test to determine whether mixed transactions are taxable. Tennessee Letter Ruling No. 16-02 (March 8, 2016); Tennessee Letter Ruling No. 16-04 (June 8, 2016). A mixed transaction contains both taxable and nontaxable components. If the true object of such a transaction is taxable, or if a crucial, essential, necessary, consequential, or integral element of the transaction is taxable, then tax applies to the entire transaction. Tennessee Letter Ruling No. 16-02 (March 8, 2016); Tennessee Letter Ruling No. 16-04 (June 8, 2016); Thomas Nelson Inc. v. Olsen, 723 S.W.2d 621, 622 (Tenn.1987). A mixed transaction escapes taxation only when the true object is not taxable, and any items that would be taxable otherwise are incidental to the true object. Tennessee Letter Ruling No. 16-02 (March 8, 2016); Tennessee Letter Ruling No. 16-04 (June 8, 2016). When multiple services are provided to a single customer, the totality of the circumstances contained in the contract must be examined to determine the true object of the transaction. Tennessee Letter Ruling No. 14-10 (Oct. 13, 2014). See, e.g., Tennessee Letter Ruling No. 14-11 (Oct. 30, 2014) (analyzing the true object test as applied to services and software provided under one contract). BNA-SUTN TN 9.3.1.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Bundled Transactions

Taxable Generally in Tennessee, whenever two or more items are sold for a single sales price, and the sale of at least one of the items is taxable, then the entire sales price is taxable as a bundled transaction. Tennessee Letter Ruling No. 16-02 (March 8, 2016); Tennessee Letter Ruling No. 16-04 (June 8, 2016). Effective July 1, 2013, until July 1, 2021, a bundled transaction means the retail sale of two or more services when the services are otherwise distinct and identifiable, and the services are sold for one non-itemized price. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-539(a)(1) effective until July 1, 2021. Effective July 1, 2021, the definition for “bundled transaction” can be found in Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-102(8) as added by 2007 Tenn. S.B. 2223, §133, effective July 1, 2009, as amended by 2019 Tenn. H.B. 931, effective April 12, 2019 (extending Tennessee's compliance with SSUTA until July 1, 2021). Excluded from the definition are sales of any services when the sales price varies or is negotiable, based on the purchaser's selection of the services included in the transaction. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-539(a)(2) effective until July 1, 2021. In both the current statute and the statute effective July 1, 2021, concerning bundled transactions comprising telecommunication services, ancillary services, Internet access services, audio or video programming services, or direct-to-home satellite television programming services, when the sales price is attributable to services that are taxable and services that are nontaxable, the portion of the price attributable to the nontaxable services is subject to tax unless the provider can identify, by reasonable and verifiable standards, the portion not subject to tax from its books and records that are kept in the regular course of business for other purposes, including, but not limited to, nontax purposes. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-539(b)(1) effective until July 1, 2021. Effective July 1, 2013, until July 1, 2021, concerning the same bundled transactions described above, when the price is attributable to services that are subject to tax at different rates, the total price is subject to tax at the highest rate unless the provider can identify, by reasonable and verifiable standards, the portion of the price attributable to the products subject to tax at the lower rate from its books and records that are kept in the regular course of business for other purposes, including, but not limited to, nontax purposes. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-539(b)(2). This provision is not in Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-539 effective July 1, 2021. Effective July 1, 2021, a bundled transaction is a retail sale involving two or more products sold for one non-itemized price. Outside of the bundled transaction, the products are otherwise distinct and identifiable, each being sold separately. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-102(8)(A) as added by 2007 Tenn. S.B. 2223, §133, effective July 1, 2009, as amended by 2019 Tenn. H.B. 931, effective April 12, 2019 (extending Tennessee's compliance with SSUTA until July 1, 2021). Bundled transactions do not include the sale of any products when the price is variable, or is negotiable, based on the purchaser's selection of products included in the transaction. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-102(8)(B) as added by 2007 Tenn. S.B. 2223, §133, effective July 1, 2009, as amended by 2019 Tenn. H.B. 931, effective April 12, 2019 (extending Tennessee's compliance with SSUTA until July 1, 2021). Likewise, bundled transactions cannot involve real property or services to real property. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-102(8)(A) as added by 2007 Tenn. S.B. 2223, §133, effective July 1, 2009, as amended by 2019 Tenn. H.B. 931, effective April 12, 2019 (extending Tennessee's compliance with SSUTA until July 1, 2021). A transaction otherwise satisfying the definition of a bundled transaction is not a bundled transaction if it is any of the following:• a retail sale of tangible personal property and a service when the tangible personal property is essential to the use of the service, and the tangible personal property is provided exclusively in connection with the service, so long as the true object of the transaction is the service; Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-102(8)(E)(i) as added by 2007 Tenn. S.B. 2223, §133, effective July 1, 2009, as amended by 2019 Tenn. H.B. 931, effective April 12, 2019 (extending Tennessee's compliance with SSUTA until July 1, 2021). • a retail sale of services where one service is provided that is essential to the use or receipt of a second service, the first service is provided exclusively in connection with the second service, and the true object of the transaction is the second service; Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-102(8)(E)(ii) as added by 2007 Tenn. S.B. 2223, §133, effective July 1, 2009, as amended by 2019 Tenn. H.B. 931, effective April 12, 2019 (extending Tennessee's compliance with SSUTA until July 1, 2021). • a transaction that includes taxable products and nontaxable products, and the purchase price or sales price of the taxable products is de minimis, 10 percent or less of the total price of the bundled products; Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-102(8)(E)(iii) as added by 2007 Tenn. S.B. 2223, §133, effective July 1, 2009, as amended by 2019 Tenn. H.B. 931, effective April 12, 2019 (extending Tennessee's compliance with SSUTA until July 1, 2021). or • a retail sale of exempt tangible personal property and taxable tangible personal property when the transaction includes food and food ingredients, drugs, durable medical equipment, mobility enhancing equipment, over-the-counter drugs, prosthetic devices, or medical supplies, and the vendor's or seller's purchase price or sales price of the taxable tangible personal property is 50 percent or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled tangible personal property. Vendors and sellers may not use a combination of the purchase price and sales price of the tangible personal property when making the 50 percent determination for a transaction. Tenn. Code Ann. §67-6-102(8)(E)(iv) as added by 2007 Tenn. S.B. 2223, §133, effective July 1, 2009, as amended by 2019 Tenn. H.B. 931, effective April 12, 2019 (extending Tennessee's compliance with SSUTA until July 1, 2021). BNA-SUTN TN 9.3.2.
