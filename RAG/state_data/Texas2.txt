Topic: Administration and Procedure Agencies Responsible for Administration Local Sales and Use Tax

Texas Comptroller The Texas Comptroller administers, collects, and enforces all taxes imposed by a county, municipality, transit district, or other special purpose district in Texas. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §324.021; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §111.0022; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §325.001; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §327.002. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §323.301; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.301; Tex.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Vendor/Seller Registration

Required Each Texas seller must apply to the Comptroller and obtain a tax permit for each in-state place of business. This includes itinerant vendors, kiosk owner-operators, and sellers temporarily operating in Texas. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(b)(1), as amended by 43 Tex. Reg. 50 (Dec. 14, 2018), effective Jan. 1, 2019. Also, each out-of-state seller that has nexus with Texas and is engaged in business in Texas must apply to the Comptroller and obtain a tax permit. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(b)(2), as amended by 43 Tex. Reg. 50 (Dec. 14, 2018), effective Jan. 1, 2019. Texas does not require independent salespersons of direct sales organizations to hold sales tax permits to sell taxable items for direct sales organizations. Direct sales organizations must obtain Texas sales or use tax permits and collect Texas tax on all sales of taxable items by their independent salespeople. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(b)(3); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(b)(4), as amended by 43 Tex. Reg. 50 (Dec. 14, 2018), effective Jan. 1, 2019. A person who engages in business in Texas as a seller without a tax permit commits a criminal offense. Each day that a person operates a business without the permit is a separate offense. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(b)(4) (archived as of Dec. 31, 2014); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.305. To Obtain a Permit A person must complete a Texas Application for Sales and Use Tax Permit, available online, and must send a signed application to the Comptroller, together with bond or other security. A separate permit under the same account is issued to the applicant for each place of business. The permit is issued without charge. Electronically filed applications are deemed signed documents. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(c)(1). Each legal entity (corporation, partnership, sole proprietor, etc.) must apply for its own permit. An individual or sole proprietor must be at least 18 years of age unless the Comptroller allows an exception from the age requirement. The permit cannot be transferred from one owner to another. The permit is valid only for the person to whom it was issued and for the transaction of business only at the address that is shown on the permit. If a person operates two or more types of business at the same location, then only one permit is required. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(c)(2). The permit must be conspicuously displayed at the place of business for which it is issued. A permit-holder with traveling salespeople who operate from one central office needs only one permit, which must be displayed at the central office. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(c)(3). All permits of the seller will have the same taxpayer number; however, each business location will have a different outlet number. The outlet numbers assigned may not necessarily correspond to the number of business locations owned by a taxpayer. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(c)(4). Suspension of Permit If a person fails to comply with any provision of the Texas Tax Code or with the rules issued by the Comptroller under those statutes, the Comptroller may suspend the person's permit or permits. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(l)(1). Before a seller's permit is suspended, the Comptroller will give at least 20 days notice and then the seller is entitled to a hearing before the Comptroller to show cause why the permit or permits should not be suspended. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(l)(2). After a permit has been suspended, a new permit will not be issued to the same seller until the seller has posted sufficient security and satisfied the Comptroller that the seller will comply with both the provisions of the law and the Comptroller's rules and regulations. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(l)(3). Refusal to Issue Permit The Comptroller is required to refuse to issue any permit to a person who:• is not permitted or licensed as required by law for a different tax or activity administered by the Comptroller; Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(l)(1). or • is currently delinquent in the payment of any tax or fee collected by the Comptroller. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(l)(2). Cancellation of Sales Tax Permits with No Reported Business Activity Any holder of a sales tax permit who reported no business activity in the previous calendar year is deemed to have abandoned the permit and the Comptroller may cancel the permit. The term “no business activity” means zero total sales, zero taxable sales, and zero taxable purchases. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(m). Trade Shows A retailer is considered to be engaged in business in Texas if the retailer has a representative, agent, salesperson, canvasser, or solicitor operating in Texas under the authority of the retailer or its subsidiary for the purpose of selling, delivering, or taking orders for a taxable item. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.107(a)(2). Demonstrating products at a trade show is considered soliciting orders, and thus subjects an out-of-state retailer to Texas tax collection requirements. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 46,628 (Aug. 28, 2006). Promoters A promoter of a flea market, trade day, or other event that involves sales of taxable items is a seller and is responsible for the collection and remittance of the sales tax that dealers, salespeople, or individuals collect at such events, unless the participants hold active sales tax permits issued by the Comptroller. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(a)(11); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(a)(10)(A), as amended by 43 Tex. Reg. 50 (Dec. 14, 2018), effective Jan. 1, 2019. Promoters of these events must hold a Texas sales and use tax permit. Texas Tax Publication 96-211. BNA-SUTN TX 31.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Tax Collection and Remittance

Vendor Any person who receives or collects a tax from another person holds that money in trust for the benefit of the state of Texas and is liable to the state for the full amount collected plus any accrued penalties and interest on the amount collected. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §111.016(a). The same holds true for agency relationships:if an agent makes a taxable sale or purchase on behalf of the principal, both the agent and principal are liable for any sales or use taxes due until such tax is remitted to the Comptroller. Thus, if an agent completes a sale on behalf of the agent's principal—and that sale is subject to sales tax—the agent does not escape liability by simply remitting the tax due to the principal; the agent remains liable until the principal remits the tax to the Comptroller. Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201604754L (April 22, 2016). An agent purchasing items on behalf of a principal must pay or accrue tax as if the principal were purchasing the items directly. The agent may seek reimbursement from the principal for the tax paid, but the invoice must indicate that the charge is for “tax reimbursement” and not “sales tax” or “use tax.” Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201809004L (Sept. 7, 2018). When sales tax is added to the price of property it becomes a debt of the purchaser until the tax is paid. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.052(a). See Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 110,638 (July 15, 2015) (company liable for tax on its purchases absent evidence that tax had been paid or that tax was due from the vendor). The person storing, using, or consuming a taxable item in Texas is liable for the use tax unless the person pays the tax to a retailer engaged in business in Texas, or to any person authorized by the Comptroller to collect the tax, and receives a purchaser's receipt. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.102; Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.346(d). A person is presumed to have received or collected a tax if the person files a tax return or report with the Comptroller showing that tax is due. A person, including a person who is on the accrual method of accounting, may rebut this presumption by providing satisfactory documentation to the Comptroller that the tax on a transaction or series of transactions was not collected. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §111.016(a-1). Effective Oct. 1, 2019, a retailer may directly or indirectly advertise, hold out, or state to a customer or to the public that the retailer will pay sales tax for the customer. In the advertisement or statement, the retailer must indicate that it is paying the tax for the customer and not indicate that the sale is exempt or excluded from tax. The receipt or similar statement must state the amount of tax and that the tax will be paid by the retailer. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.704(b), as added by 2019 Tex. H.B. 2358, effective Oct. 1, 2019. The retailer is then liable to the state for the tax. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §111.016(a-2), as added by 2019 Tex. H.B. 2358, effective Oct. 1, 2019. The purchaser of a business must withhold from the price paid for the business an amount sufficient to pay the business's outstanding sales tax liabilities. The purchaser is relieved of this obligation upon receiving from the seller a receipt for payment of the taxes owing or a certificate stating that no outstanding liability exists. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §111.020(a); Texas Comptroller's Decision Hearing No. 108,459 (Oct. 25, 2016). BNA-SUTN TX 31.3.1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Purchaser Liability

Yes The person using, storing, or consuming a taxable item in Texas is liable for use tax on that item, unless sales tax was paid to the seller at the time of the purchase. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.102; Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(b)(4); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(b)(5), as amended by 43 Tex. Reg. 50 (Dec. 14, 2018), effective Jan. 1, 2019. A purchaser's liability for use tax continues until the tax is paid over to the state. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.102(a). BNA-SUTN TX 31.3.2.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Business Owners, Operators

Yes An individual who controls or supervises the collection of tax from another person or an individual who controls or supervises the accounting for and paying over of the tax, and who willfully fails to pay the tax is liable as a responsible individual for an amount equal to the tax not paid. See Tex. Tax Code Ann. §111.016(b). When corporate tax liability is assessed against an individual, the Comptroller must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the individual meets the requirements for individual liability. See Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing Nos. 114,039, 114,040 (May 2, 2018) (Comptroller staff did not provide clear and convincing evidence that a member with authority to write checks for a company's purchases met the requirements for individual liability); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 114,569 (March 6, 2018) (Comptroller staff did not provide clear and convincing evidence that taxpayer exercised financial control over the corporation to the extent that he was in a position to either properly remit collected taxes or divert them for another purpose); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing Nos. 109,597, 109,644 (July 12, 2018) (Comptroller staff did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that the taxpayer was involved in the day-to-day operations of the business); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 114,041 (May 30, 2018) (Comptroller staff did not provide any evidence that the taxpayer controlled or supervised the accounting and payment of sales tax). An individual's corporate role, by itself, is insufficient proof that they are a responsible individual. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing Nos. 113,891, 113,893 (May 30, 2018) (petitioner's role as director and CFO did not prove the petitioner was a responsible individual). This liability is in addition to any other penalty provided by law. Further, the dissolution of a corporation, association, limited liability company, or partnership does not affect a responsible individual's liability. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §111.016(b); see Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,866 (Aug. 26, 2016) (company president who was performing acts related to the collection, accounting, or payment of sales and use and other taxes deemed a responsible individual and held personally liable for company's unpaid taxes for tax periods during which he held the position). But see Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 108,158 (Sept. 13, 2016) (managing member of closed company with delinquent sales tax liability is not liable for unpaid taxes because there was no evidence that member either controlled or supervised the collection, accounting and payment of tax monies and thus, no support for the member to be designated as a responsible individual); see also Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 103,412 (Dec. 12, 2014) (director of a company who only signed checks at the request of a store manager was not personally liable because the Division did not prove he was responsible for collecting and remitting taxes); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 108,378 (Nov. 6, 2014) (managing member and 50-percent owner of a company was not personally responsible because the Revenue Accounting Division failed to meet its statutory burden of clear and convincing evidence that the managing member was responsible for collecting and remitting taxes); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 109,705 (Dec. 19, 2013) (corporate officer of convenience stores was not personally liable for an assessment based on fraud; the record failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence, the involvement of the officer in the preparation of the company's sales tax returns); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 105,174 (Aug. 29, 2013) (corporate officer was not proved to have willfully failed to pay the tax owed, and was therefore not personally liable for company's taxes). The fact that an individual is the sole owner of a company is not per se evidence that the individual is a responsible individual for purposes of establishing individual liability. See Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 109,643 (June 7, 2018). Additionally, a company's officer, manager, director, or partner who takes an action or participates in a fraudulent scheme or fraudulent plan to evade the payment of taxes is personally liable for those unpaid taxes along with any penalty and interest due. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §111.0611; see also Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,790 (July 14, 2015) (a manager of company was not personally liable for sales and use taxes owed by the company as there was no evidence of manager's role in preparing or filing company's sales tax returns, nor was there clear and convincing evidence that manager participated in a fraudulent scheme or plan to evade payment of sales taxes); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,197 (June 2, 2015) (president of company was not personally liable for an assessment as the only evidence regarding petitioner's involvement in the underreporting of tax was his signature on several franchise tax reports; therefore, the Tax Division failed to present by clear and convincing evidence that he took an action or participated in a fraudulent scheme or fraudulent plan to evade the payment of taxes). But see Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 110,663 (July 27, 2018) (personal liability cannot be imposed on limited partner of the limited partnership) If the corporate privileges of a corporation are forfeited due to failure to report or pay the Texas Franchise Tax, each director or officer of the corporation becomes liable for each debt of the corporation that is created or incurred in Texas after the date on which the report or payment of the franchise tax was due, and until the corporate privileges are reinstated. See Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 114,779 (Jan. 4, 2019) (holding an officer of a corporation personally liable for unpaid sales tax incurred while the corporation's corporate privileges were forfeited); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing Nos. 114,730, 114,731, 114,732, 114,733 (Feb. 6, 2018). Personal liability for fraudulent tax evasion must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §1.40, as repealed by 43 Tex. Reg. 50 (Dec. 14, 2018), and replaced with Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §1.26, effective Jan. 1, 2019. See, e.g., Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,233 (Sept. 9, 2016)(corporate officer held personally where she was involved in business operations and prepared and filed sales tax returns, and thus, was or should have been aware of gross underreporting of tax); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,790 (July 14, 2015); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 109,705 (Dec. 19, 2013). But see Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,486 (Oct. 31, 2016) (dismissing personal liability assessment against individual owner who relied on the advice of the company's bookkeeper); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 107,362 (Sept. 20, 2013) (personal liability dismissed because the record did not establish by clear and convincing evidence that the individual took an action or participated in a fraudulent scheme or plan to evade paying tax). Liability rests on showing an individual willfully failed to pay the tax owed. An individual acts willfully if they use collected sales tax funds to pay other creditors, or recklessly disregards the risk that the collected taxes may not be remitted to the government. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing Nos. 114,902, 114,903, 114,904 (Aug. 22, 2018) (placing sales tax funds into a bank account which serves as collateral for a loan and is subject to being seized by a lender is reckless) When a successor purchases a business or the stock of goods of a business, the successor must withhold any unpaid state taxes from the purchase price until the seller provides proof from the Comptroller that the tax has been paid. Otherwise, the successor purchaser will be liable for the unpaid tax up to the amount of the purchase price. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §111.020; see Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,237 (despite complex series of transactions involving multiple parties related to the sale of a convenience store, ultimate purchaser is held liable for prior owner's unpaid sales and use tax, penalty and interest up to the value paid for the business) (May 10, 2016); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,845 (Nov. 2, 2017) (the comptroller looks at the entire transaction to determine whether the business has been sold). When corporate privileges have been revoked according to Tex. Tax Code Ann. §171.251, a corporate officer or director will not be liable for the corporation's debt if the debt was created or incurred over the director's objections or without his or her knowledge if the exercise of reasonable diligence would not have revealed an intention to create the debt. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §171.255. BNA-SUTN TX 31.3.3.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Forms and Returns

Provided The Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts makes forms available to all persons who are required to file returns. However, the failure of the taxpayer to obtain the forms does not relieve that taxpayer from the requirement to file and remit the tax timely. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(g)(1). Returns and Forms The following are few of the sales and use tax returns and forms that Texas makes available:• Texas Form 01-114: Sales and Use Tax Return; • Texas Form 01-115: Sales and Use Tax Return—Outlet Supplement; • Texas Form 01-116-A: Sales and Use Tax Return—List Supplement; • Texas Form 01-117: Sales and Use Tax Return—Short Form; • Texas Form 01-118: Sales and Use Tax Prepayment Report; • Texas Form 01-119: Direct Payment Return; • Texas Form 01-148: Sales and Use Tax Return—Credits and Customs Broker Schedule; • Texas Form 01-149: Direct Pay Tax Return Credits Schedule; • Texas Form 01-156: Use Tax Return; • Texas Form 01-339: Sales and Use Tax Resale Certificate/Exemption Certificate. For a complete list of sales and use tax forms, see Bloomberg Tax's Sales and Use Tax Interactive Forms. The failure of the taxpayer to obtain the forms does not relieve that taxpayer from the requirement to file and remit the tax timely. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(g)(1). Voluntary Electronic Filing The Comptroller of Public Accounts may authorize a taxpayer to file reports or returns electronically if:• the taxpayer or its authorized agent has registered with the comptroller to use an approved reporting method (e.g., WebFile), or the taxpayer is filing a return or report other than a return showing a tax liability; Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.9(a)(1). and • each return or report's electronic transmission method is made in a manner compatible with the comptroller's equipment and facilities. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.9(a)(2). BNA-SUTN TX 31.4.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Due Date Filing

20th of the Month Generally, Texas requires sales and use tax returns to be filed on or before the 20th day of the month following the period ending date. If this date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the due date is the next business day. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(f)(1). However, Texas provides alternative filing schedules for taxpayers depending on the amount of the taxpayer's tax liability. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(g)(2); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(g)(1) Monthly Reporting Sellers, as well as purchasers who owe tax that was not collected by sellers, who have $1,500 or more in state tax per quarter to report must file monthly returns except for sellers who prepay the tax. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(g)(3). The returns must be filed on or before the 20th day of the month following the period ending date. If this date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the due date is the next business day. Extensions of up to 90 days are available for taxpayers located in areas designated as disaster or emergency areas by either the state or federal executive branch. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(f). Quarterly Reporting Sellers, as well as purchasers who owe tax that was not collected by sellers, who have less than$1,500 in state tax per quarter to report may file returns quarterly. The quarterly reporting periods end on March 31, June 30, Sept. 30, and Dec. 31. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(g)(1). Yearly Reporting Sellers (and purchasers who owe uncollected use tax) with less than $1,000 of state tax to report during a calendar year may file yearly returns upon authorization from the Comptroller. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(g)(2). The return and payment are due on or before Jan. 20 of the next calendar year. If this date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the due date is the next business day. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(g)(2)(F). Authorization to file returns on a yearly basis is conditioned upon the correct and timely filing of prior returns. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(g)(2)(A). A taxpayer who files on a yearly basis without authorization is liable for applicable penalty and interest on any previously unreported quarter. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(g)(2)(C). The taxpayer must file a return for that month or quarter, depending on the amount, in which the tax remittance or liability is greater than $1,000. On that report, the taxpayer must report all taxes that are collected and all accrued liability for the year, and must file monthly or quarterly, as appropriate, so long as the yearly tax liability is greater than $1,000. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(g)(2)(D). BNA-SUTN TX 31.5.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Due Date Payment

Due with Filing Sales and use tax returns and remittances are due no later than the 20th day of the month following each reporting period end date unless otherwise provided. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(f). On or before the 20th day of the month that follows the quarter or month for which a prepayment was made, the taxpayer must file a return showing the actual liability and remit any tax due that exceeds the prepayment. If the normal due date for prepayment or return filing falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the due date is the next business day. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(h)(2)(D). Prepayments may be made by taxpayers who file monthly or quarterly returns. The amount of the prepayment must be a reasonable estimate of the state and local tax liability for the entire reporting period. “Reasonable estimate”means at least 90 percent of the total amount due or an amount equal to the actual net tax liability due and paid for the same reporting period of the preceding year. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(h)(2). A taxpayer who makes a timely prepayment based upon a reasonable estimate of tax liability may retain an additional discount of 1.25 percent of the amount due. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(h)(2)(A). The monthly prepayment is due on or before the 15th day of the month for which the prepayment is made. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(h)(2)(B). The quarterly prepayment is due on or before the 15th day of the second month of the quarter for which the tax is due. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(h)(2)(C). If there is an additional amount due after prepayment is applied, the taxpayer may retain the 0.5-percent reimbursement provided that both the return and the additional amount due are timely filed. If the prepayment exceeded the actual liability, the taxpayer will be mailed an overpayment notice or refund warrant. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(h)(2)(D). The Comptroller will not allow the 1.25-percent discount if a prepayment is less than 90 percent of the tax due or 100 percent of the amount due for the same reporting period of the previous year. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.286(h)(2)(E). BNA-SUTN TX 31.5.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Due Date Extensions Extensions for Good Cause

Available The comptroller may grant a reasonable extension of time, not to exceed 45 days, for the filing of a report. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §111.057(a). To qualify for an extension of time, the person required to file a report must make a request for the extension and remit no less than 90 percent of the amount of the tax estimated to be due on or before the filing date. The request must be in writing and include the reason an extension is needed. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §111.057(b). BNA-SUTN TX 31.5.3.1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Due Date Extensions Extensions for Disaster Relief

Allowed. In Texas, the comptroller may grant an extension of time to file a return or pay a tax of up to 90 days to any taxpayer that is a victim of a natural disaster. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §111.058(a); Texas Tax Publication 94-182. Specifically, when the governor of Texas or the president of the United States declares a location in Texas to be a disaster area, taxpayers in the affected area are eligible for filing extensions for their taxes. Taxpayers in Texas counties declared disaster areas can request an extension to file their taxes. The Texas Comptroller's office allows temporary filing extensions on a case-by-case basis. Our office will notify taxpayers when we grant or deny their extension requests. Tex.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Payment Methods Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)

Required for Certain Taxpayers Taxpayers who will likely pay over $10,000 in sales and use tax liability in a fiscal year must pay using electronic funds transfer and taxpayers who will likely pay over $100,000 in a fiscal year must pay using TexNet. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.9(b). Required TexNet Payment for Amounts Over $100,000 If a taxpayer has paid$100,000 or more in sales and use taxes during the preceding state fiscal year (i.e., Sept. 1 to Aug. 31), and if the Comptroller reasonably anticipates that the taxpayer will pay at least that amount during the current fiscal year, then the taxpayer must remit all payment amounts in that category using the State of Texas Financial Network(TexNet). Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.9(b)(1); Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts Aug. 2016 Fiscal Notes Newsletter (Aug. 1, 2016). Required EFT Payment for Amounts Between $10,000 and $100,000 If a taxpayer has paid at least $10,000—but less than $100,000—in sales and use taxes during the preceding state fiscal year (i.e., Sept. 1 to Aug. 31), and if the Comptroller reasonably anticipates that the taxpayer will pay at least that amount during the current fiscal year, then the taxpayer must remit all payment amounts in that category using a comptroller-approved electronic funds transfer method (EFT method). Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.9(b)(2); see also Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.9(b)(2)(A)(i) (identifying state and local sales and use tax as a tax category to which the rule applies). Approved EFT methods include, but are not limited to, TexNet, electronic check (WebEFT), and electronically transmitted credit card information. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.9(b)(2)(C). If a taxpayer cannot comply due to hardship, impracticality, or another valid reason, then the taxpayer can submit a written request to the comptroller asking that the comptroller waive the requirement. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.9(b)(2)(D). EFT Payment Date Pursuant to Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §15.33, a taxpayer that pays using TexNet may choose either to accept the TexNet-offered settlement date or to enter a settlement date up to 30 days from the business day that follows the payment date. TexNet offers the business day following the day on which payment information is entered into TexNet if the information is entered before 6:00 p.m. central time. If the taxpayer files combined tax returns and pays using the electronic data interchange (EDI) system, then the taxpayer must submit the payment information to the comptroller by 2:30 p.m. central time to meet the 6:00 p.m. central time requirement. A taxpayer that pays using a non-TexNet, non-EDI EFT system must submit payment information by 11:59 p.m. central time on the date payment is due. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.9(c).

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Resale Exemption Certificates

Required All gross receipts of a seller are presumed to have been subject to the sales tax unless a properly completed resale or exemption certificate is accepted by the seller. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.054(a). A purchaser may provide a resale certificate to the seller in order to avoid paying sales and use tax if the purchaser plans on reselling the item. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.285(c)(2)(A). The resale certificate must show:• the name and address of the purchaser; Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.285(g)(1). • the number from the sales tax permit held by the purchaser or a statement that an application for a permit is pending before the Comptroller with the date the application for a permit was made. If the application is pending, the resale certificate is valid for only 60 days, after which time the resale certificate must be renewed to show the permanent permit number. If the purchaser holds a Texas sales and use tax permit, the number must consist of 11 digits that begin with a 1 or 3. Federal Employer's Identification (FEI) numbers or Social Security numbers are not acceptable evidence of resale. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.285(g)(2). • a description of the taxable items generally sold, leased, or rented by the purchaser in the regular course of business and a description of the taxable items to be purchased tax free by use of the certificate. The item to be purchased may be generally described on the certificate or itemized in an order or invoice attached to the certificate; Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.285(g)(3). See Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 110,666 (Aug. 15, 2016) (blanket exemption certificate invalid because it did not include a description of the nature of goods purchased). • the signature of the purchaser or an electronic form of the purchaser's signature authorized by the Comptroller and the date; Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.285(g)(4). and • the name and address of the seller. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.285(g)(5). All gross receipts of a seller are presumed to have been subject to the sales tax unless a properly completed resale or exemption certificate is accepted by the seller. However, a purchaser may claim an exemption even without issuance of a certificate if the purchaser can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that payments were made for items that qualified for the resale exemption. For items with serial numbers or other unique identifying features, tracking the identifier through inventory and sale is one way to demonstrate that the items were held for resale. If items are not tracked by a unique number, or if the items at issue do not have such identifying characteristics, a purchaser may provide other evidence to support a finding that items purchased were placed in an inventory and that 100% of that inventory were resold. For example, books and records reflecting the source of all of the purchases at issue and the receipt of all of the identified purchases in a documented inventory, and evidence demonstrating that all of the items held in the inventory were resold to U.S. purchasers may suffice to support a resale exemption. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 114,343 (Jan. 10, 2018). Generally, resale certificates are the only acceptable form of proof for the resale exemption, and failure to secure and produce completed resale certificates can result in the seller being held liable even if the customer does resell the items in question. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing Nos. 110,332 (May 4, 2016); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing Nos. 113,172, 113,173 (March 16, 2018) (affirming an audit assessment where the taxpayer could not produce resale certificates within the 60-day reconciliation period as required by the Comptroller).

The blanket exemption certificate covers all future sales of taxable items to the permit-holder and relieves the seller of the obligation of collecting the taxes imposed from the permit-holder. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.417(a). A blanket exemption certificate given must contain the direct payment permit number and the statement that the direct payment permit-holder agrees to accrue and pay to the state of Texas all taxes that are or may become due on the taxable items sold under the exemption certificate to the permit-holder. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.417(b). All applicants for a direct payment permit must comply with the following conditions, prerequisites, and qualifications:• The applicant must annually purchase at least $800,000 worth of taxable items for the person's own use and not for resale. A statement to this effect must be submitted to the Comptroller, and adequate records must be available to support this statement. The statement must accompany the application for a direct payment permit. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.288(b)(1). • The applicant must be able to establish to the satisfaction of the Comptroller that the applicant is a responsible person and that the applicant's accounting methods clearly distinguish between taxable and nontaxable purchases. A clear statement of the accounting method intended to be used must accompany the application for a direct payment permit. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.288(b)(2). • The applicant must agree to accrue and pay all taxes on the direct payment return for items not specifically exempted and to make the payments to the state of Texas on or before the 20th day of the month following each monthly period in which the items become subject to the tax by reason of use or consumption in Texas.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Refunds

Vendor A sales and use tax permit-holder who has paid tax in error directly to the Comptroller may request a refund of the tax paid in error. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, § 3.325(a)(2). A sales and use tax permit-holder who has paid tax in error to another permitted seller may request from the Comptroller or the seller a refund of tax paid in error. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.325(a)(3). When a taxpayer requests a refund, it must establish by preponderance of evidence that the tax was erroneously collected or paid. However, if the claimant relies on an exemption to establish the error, then it must provide evidence that is clear and convincing. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §§1.40(2)(A) and (2)(B), as repealed by 43 Tex. Reg. 50 (Dec. 14, 2018), and replaced with Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §1.26, effective Jan. 1, 2019. See Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,376 (Dec. 12, 2016) (claimant failed to present any evidence to support a refund request); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 110,957 (Jan. 20, 2017) (taxpayer requested refund based on a claim of exemption; however, taxpayer failed to prove exemption by clear and convincing evidence); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,697 (Nov. 15, 2017). A permitted purchaser who requests a refund from the Comptroller must submit to the Comptroller a written request that states the basis for the refund and includes:• the seller's name, address, and either the sales tax permit number or information that will enable the Comptroller to identify the seller's sales tax permit number; • the invoice number, if applicable; • the date of purchase; • a description of the item purchased; • the specific basis for the refund; • information that identifies the local taxing authorities for which tax was paid;and • a statement or reasonable estimate of the amount of the tax refund requested. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.325(a)(4). A seller must first refund any taxes to the person from whom the taxes were collected before receiving a refund from the state. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §111.104(f); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 114,831 (Oct. 28, 2018) (denying a refund request for interest payments because the seller did not refund interest to its customers). The Comptroller may require a person to submit additional information to verify the refund claim. The person must show to the satisfaction of the Comptroller that the refund is due and make available to the Comptroller any documentation that the Comptroller requires to process the refund. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.325(b)(2)(B); see Hegar v. Ryan, LLC, 03-13-00400-CV, 2015 BL 158178, (Tex. App. May 20, 2015) (The Court of Appeals affirmed the finding that certain provisions in a Texas sales tax refund rule requiring transactional detail and supporting documentation were declared illegal because they imposed additional burdens, conditions, and restrictions on tax refund claims in excess of the provisions in Texas Stat. §111.104); see also Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 107,047 (Sept. 21, 2015) (taxpayer's documentation did not support all the refund claims that were submitted or that the taxpayer paid tax erroneously; thus, except as provided, the taxpayer's claims for refunds were denied); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 133,677 (Nov. 20, 2017) (a refund claim must be related to an audit assessment). Taxpayers claiming a refund may be required to provide documentation with transaction-level detail indicating that they have not claimed any credits from the date of the claimed tax overpayment.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Statute of Limitations Refund Requests

4 Years A claim for refund must be made within four years from the date on which the tax was due and payable. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.325(b)(1)-(3). A refund claim pursuant to a deficiency determination must be made by the later of four years from the date on which the tax was due and payable, or six months after the date on which the deficiency determination for the periods becomes final. A refund claim made within six months after the deficiency determination's date of finality, is within the limitations period for only those items included in the determination. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.325(b)(1)-(3); see Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,985 (March 8, 2018) (refund request denied because the statute of limitations had tolled; taxpayer's lawsuit filed in state trial court did not reset the statute of limitations). If the Comptroller and a taxpayer have agreed in writing to extend the limitations period, then a claim for refund must be made before the expiration of the extended period in the agreement. An extension of the statute of limitations applies only to the periods that are specified in the agreement. An expired agreement to extend the statute of limitations has no effect, and the statute of limitations for subsequent assessments and refund requests is determined as if no extension had been authorized. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.325(b)(4). BNA-SUTN TX 31.11.1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Statute of Limitations Assessment of Additional Tax

4 Years The Comptroller has four years from the date the tax becomes due and payable to assess the liability. Before the expiration of the statute of limitations, the Comptroller and a taxpayer may agree in writing to an extension. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.339(a)(1). In cases of fraud, or in situations where sales tax returns have not been filed, the statute of limitations does not apply and the Comptroller may assess and collect taxes, penalties, and interest at any time. Furthermore, the statute of limitations does not apply when information contained in the report of a taxpayer contains a gross error and the amount of tax due and payable after correction of the error is 25-percent or more than the amount initially reported. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.339(a)(3). An extension applies only to the periods specifically mentioned in the agreement. Any assessment or refund request pertaining to periods for which limitations have been extended must be made prior to the expiration date of the agreement. Following expiration of the agreement, the statute of limitations applies to subsequent assessments and refund requests as if no extension had been authorized. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.339(a)(2). Successor Liability In the case of successor liability, the Comptroller has four years in which to issue a notice of deficiency or jeopardy determination to the purchaser of the business or stock of goods. The four-year period in which the Comptroller may assess begins to run for the purchaser from the date of the sale to the purchaser or from the date a determination issued to the seller becomes final, whichever event occurs later. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.339(b). It is the Comptroller's burden to establish that imposition of successor liability is appropriate. The Comptroller must establish that the predecessor business sold a business or a stock of goods and that some amount of consideration was passed from the new owner to the predecessor. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.7; Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 109,480 (March 6, 2017); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,845 (Nov. 2, 2017) (the Comptroller will look at the whole transaction to determine the parties' intent). However, in cases involving fraudulent or sham transactions, the burden shifts to the taxpayer to show assessment error. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §111.024; Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §1.40, as repealed by 43 Tex. Reg. 50 (Dec. 14, 2018), and replaced with Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §1.26, effective Jan. 1, 2019; see Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 104,533 (Aug. 7, 2012) (successor business held liable for previous business's unpaid sales tax liability because the new owner failed to mention the predecessor business on its sales tax application, demonstrating concealment. Also, there was no evidence presented that the transfer was a bona fide sale, and thus, the transaction to acquire the business was deemed a fraudulent or sham transaction designed to avoid tax); but see Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,071 (Sept. 14, 2016) (successor business not held liable for previous business's unpaid sales tax liability because new business did not purchase predecessor's fixed assets, capital assets, realty, name, goodwill, or inventory;and new business operated with a new phone number, new utility accounts and new sales tax and tobacco permits); and see Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 108,899 (Feb. 8, 2016) (successor liability would not have been imposed, except that the transfer of the business was done with the intent to evade tax; the taxpayer could not satisfy his burden showing that the assessment was erroneous); but see Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing Nos. 113,737, 113,738 (Aug. 31, 2017) (successor business held liable for previous business's unpaid sales tax liability because the new owner failed to mention the purchase of predecessor business on its sales application. Additionally, evidence demonstrated that successor was predecessor's father, successor's acquisition of the business assets occurred after predecessor's sales tax liabilities became final, and successor's operation of the business was under the same d/b/a and at the same location as predecessor). Suit for Collection The Comptroller has three years from the date that a deficiency determination becomes due and payable, a jeopardy determination becomes final, or after the last recording of a lien, to file suit for collection of the taxes, penalties, and interest. If the taxpayer requests a redetermination hearing, the determination will not become final until the Comptroller issues a redetermination decision and the decision becomes final. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.339(c). Notice of Delinquency The Comptroller has three years from the date that a deficiency determination becomes due and payable, a jeopardy determination becomes final, the last recording of a lien, or the redetermination decision becomes final to give notice of delinquency to all persons who have in their possession or under their control any credits or other personal property belonging to the delinquent, or who owe any debts to the delinquent. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.339(d). Seizure The Comptroller has three years from the date that the deficiency determination becomes due and payable, the jeopardy determination becomes final, or the redetermination decision becomes final to seize any property of the delinquent and sell the property, or a sufficient part of it, at public auction to pay the taxes, penalties, and interest due. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.339(e). Remedies are Cumulative The remedies of the state are cumulative and no action taken by the Comptroller or the Attorney General constitutes an election by the state to pursue any remedy to the exclusion of any other remedy.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Civil Penalties

Yes If a taxpayer fails to file or pay tax when it is due, then Texas subjects the taxpayer to a 5-percent penalty. Also, if the taxpayer fails to file or pay within 30 days after the due date, then they must pay an additional 5-percent penalty (10-percent penalty total). Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.703(a). Permit-holders must file sales and use tax returns. A permit-holder must file a sales and use tax return even if the permit-holder has no sales or use tax to report for the reporting period. The 5-percent penalty is due regardless of whether the taxpayer subsequently files the report or whether no taxes are due for the reporting period. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.703(d). Fraud Penalty If the Comptroller determines that a taxpayer committed fraud or had the intent to evade tax, the Comptroller is authorized to assess an additional 50 percent penalty to the taxpayer. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §111.061(b). In determining whether to impose the penalty, the Comptroller may impute to the taxpayer the acts or omissions of any officer, director, manager, or governing authority of the taxpayer and any agent with actual or apparent authority to prepare or submit information to the comptroller. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.15, added effective Sept. 4, 2018. The Comptroller staff has the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that the fraud penalty applies. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34 §1.40(1)(B), as repealed by 43 Tex. Reg. 50 (Dec. 14, 2018), and replaced with Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §1.26, effective Jan. 1, 2019. If assessed against a corporation, the Comptroller must also present facts that support attributing the fraudulent actions to the company. See Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,621 (Feb. 14, 2018). When a corporate officer is proven to have been directly involved in the fraudulent activities, the additional penalty against a corporation will be upheld because a corporate officer's fraudulent actions can be attributed to the corporation. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing Nos. 113,163 (March 14, 2018). Gross underreporting of taxable sales, defined as an error rate of 25 percent or greater, along with other factors or no plausible explanation, is sufficiently indicative of intent to evade the tax to warrant the assessment of the fraud penalty. See Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing Nos. 114,973, 114,994 (Jan. 14, 2019) (fraud penalty affirmed against owner-officer who was in a position to know of the gross underreporting of taxable sales); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 115,556 (Jan. 16, 2019) (fraud penalty affirmed where a taxpayer operating a convenience store was found to have underreported by more than 40 percent, the convenience store records were incomplete, and the taxpayer's alcohol and tobacco purchases exceeded taxable sales); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 114,705 (Nov. 14, 2018) (fraud penalty affirmed where a taxpayer operating a convenience store was found to have underreported by more than 49 percent, the convenience store records were incomplete, and the taxpayer's alcohol and tobacco purchases exceeded taxable sales by over 30 percent); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 114,542 (Jan. 19, 2018) (fraud penalty imposed due to a high error rate of 41.77 percent and a failure to provide complete records for an audit); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,358 (March 3, 2018) (fraud penalty imposed due to a high error rate of 71.92 percent and a failure to provide complete records for an audit); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,340 (June 2, 2017)(imposition of fraud penalty on taxpayer with an overall audit error rate of 100 percent was warranted); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,000 (Dec. 8, 2016)(liquor store's gross underreporting of sales and an audit error rate of 80.76 percent warranted imposition of fraud penalty); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 110,600 (Dec. 5, 2016) (taxpayer, a commercial construction contractor, created business records to conceal the fact that it was collecting sales tax without remitting it to the Comptroller); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,825 (Nov. 23, 2016)(upholding fraud penalty against sole proprietor in silk screening and embroidery business where audit error rate due to underreporting was 99.37 percent); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,028 (Nov. 22, 2016)(affirming fraud penalty where convenient store underreported taxable tobacco product sales by $63,000 and audit error rate was 75.57 percent); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 110,679 (Nov. 17, 2016)(upholding fraud penalty where liquor/convenience store inventory purchases exceeded reported taxable sales by $800,000, and audit error rate was 52.60 percent); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,433 (Oct. 24, 2016)(fraud penalty upheld against convenient store where audit error rate was over 51 percent and taxable sales of tobacco products were underreported by $95,859); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,792 (Dec. 11, 2015) (the audit error rate was over 50, indicating an intent to evade tax; thus a fraud penalty was warranted); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,744 (Sept. 9, 2015) (taxpayer could not provide a plausible explanation for why there was an error when taxes were grossly underreported); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,710 (Aug. 6, 2015) (taxpayer could not plausibly explain why there was a “gross” error, defined as the amount of tax due and payable exceeds the amount reported by at least 25-percent, which resulted in underreporting; thus, the fraud penalty was warranted). But see Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 114,495 (Dec. 28, 2017) (fraud penalty deleted where 25 percent or greater error rate could be explained by taxpayer's general confusion regarding sales tax); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 114,236 (Oct. 30, 2017) (fraud penalty deleted where taxpayer was not sufficiently involved in the operation of the business to attribute fraudulent tax reporting to the taxpayer); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,558 (Jan. 1, 2018) (fraud penalty deleted where Comptroller could not sufficiently demonstrate that underreporting was a result of fraud or intent to evade the tax, or erroneously backing tax because of negligence). “Plausible” is defined as conceivably true, possibly correct or even likely, reasonable, and reasonably convincing and seemingly truthful. See Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 114,236 (Oct. 30, 2017). However, gross underreporting is not sufficient, in and of itself, to warrant the assessment of the fraud penalty on corporate taxpayers, whose requisite intent is determined from the actions of officers and directors. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §111.061(b). See Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,523 (Aug. 30, 2018) (not imposing the fraud penalty, even with a 65.73% error rate, because there was no evidence of intentionally evading the payment of tax); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 114,345 (Jan. 3, 2018) (fraud penalty upheld where director and officer was aware or should have been aware of the gross underreporting of tax); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,486 (Oct. 31, 2016) (50 percent fraud penalty removed; gross underreporting was not due to fraud, but due to taxpayer's reliance on its bookkeeper's advice that services provided by taxpayer were not subject to sales tax); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,905 (Dec. 12, 2016) (fraud penalty removed because case against the taxpayer failed to include evidence regarding the identity of officers or directors of taxpayer or their role in the operation of the business); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,486, 111,624 (March 10, 2017) (petitioner was found not to be personally liable for the underreporting of the company and the fraud penalty was removed because petitioner relied on an individual with his books and sales tax reporting for more than 10 years at the time the advice was given and had no reason to doubt her); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 108,883 (June 11, 2015); see also Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 114,236 (Oct. 30, 2017) (fraudulent intent not found because owner of a bar was not involved in its operations due to ongoing treatment for alcohol addiction); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,911 (Sept. 9, 2016)(upholding fraud penalty against corporation, attributing fraudulent activity of corporate officer/owner to the corporate entity; officer was personally involved in business operations and in preparing and filing sales tax returns, and thus, was or should have been aware of gross underreporting of tax). Indeed, there must be facts that support attributing the fraudulent actions to the corporation. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 114,535 (Dec. 5, 2017). In determining whether there was a fraudulent scheme or fraudulent plan to evade the payment of taxes, the Comptroller considers:• the filing, or causing to be filed, a fraudulent tax return or report with the Comptroller on behalf of the business entity; • intentionally failing to file a tax return, report, or other required document with the Comptroller when the business entity is under a legal obligation to file; • filing, or causing to be filed, a tax return or report with the Comptroller on behalf of the business entity that contains an intentionally false statement that results in the amount of the tax due exceeding the amount of tax reported by 25- or more; and • altering, destroying, or concealing any record, document, or thing, presenting to the Comptroller any altered or fraudulent record, document, or thing, or otherwise engaging in fraudulent conduct with the intent to affect the course or outcome of a Comptroller audit or investigation, a redetermination hearing, or another proceeding involving the Comptroller.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Waiver of Penalties

Permitted The Comptroller has discretion to settle penalty or interest on a tax liability if the Comptroller determines that the taxpayer exercised reasonable diligence to comply with the tax laws. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §111.103. See Texas Interest on Credits and Refunds Due. The Comptroller has the authority to waive late payment penalties if a taxpayer exercised reasonable diligence to comply with tax laws. In making a determination of whether the taxpayer exercised reasonable diligence, the Comptroller may consider the taxpayer's audit history, whether any changes in law or Comptroller policy took effect during the audit period, the tax issues involved, the size and sophistication of the taxpayer, whether the tax was collected but not remitted, whether returns were timely filed, the completeness of the taxpayer's records, the taxpayer's efforts to comply with recordkeeping requirements, delinquencies in other taxes, reliance on advice provided by the Comptroller, and the error rate in the current audit. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §111.103; Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34 §3.5; see Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,418 (July 3, 2018) (finding reasonable diligence to justify penalty waiver for periods following a taxpayer's correction of its non-compliance with collection and remittance obligations); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 114,536 (May 22, 2018) (penalty waiver is justified where audit error rate is small); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,216 (April 9, 2018) (waiving penalty where the audit involved a complex series of legal issues, and the taxpayer had accurate and complete records); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 114,197 (April 5, 2018) (taxpayer did not exercise reasonable diligence when it collected but did not remit sales tax, and the audit found an error rate of 28.72 percent); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,460 (Jan. 8, 2018)(where a taxpayer did not propose how it demonstrated reasonable diligence to comply with the tax law, the taxpayer is not entitled to a late-payment penalty waiver); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 114,411 (Dec. 19, 2017) (taxpayer did not exercise reasonable diligence to comply where it failed to provide any records and had a high overall error rate that increased from a prior audit); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,428 (Nov. 28, 2017) (taxpayer did not demonstrate reasonable diligence to comply with tax laws where it had collected but not remitted sales tax); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 114,023 (Sept. 12, 2017) (penalty waived despite mixed audit history because there were no late-filed periods, no tax delinquencies, and no tax collected but not remitted); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,117 (Sept. 14, 2016)(reasonable due diligence to comply with tax laws shown and penalty waived where taxpayer filed just one late return during audit period and error rate was only about 10 percent); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,322 (Aug. 24, 2017)(taxpayer provided complete records, there were no other tax deficiencies, no late-filed reports, taxes were collected without remitting it, and the overall error rate improved significantly from the prior audit, therefore the penalty was waived). But see Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,071 (Oct. 17, 2017) (taxpayer's request for waiver denied because the high percentage of errors showed that it did not act with reasonable diligence); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,841 (May 3, 2017) (rejecting a petitioner's claim of detrimental reliance on advice provided on the Comptroller's website because the petitioner did not identify the specific publication source). Taxpayers asserting that they detrimentally relied on the advice of the Comptroller's office such that penalties should be waived, must satisfy the following elements:• the taxpayer was given incorrect advice, when the taxpayer had provided sufficient information to a Comptroller employee and the employee should have given correct advice; • the substance of the advice is satisfactorily established; • the taxpayer followed the advice; and • the taxpayer will suffer harm unless the Comptroller adheres to the advice. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §1.40(2)(B), as repealed by 43 Tex. Reg. 50 (Dec. 14, 2018), and replaced with Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §1.26, effective Jan. 1, 2019.

The Texas Comptroller will generally not waive penalties related to late-filing because late filing indicates a “fundamental lack of reasonable diligence.” See Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,844 (Jan. 17, 2018); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 110,070 (Aug. 27, 2015) (citing Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 107,606 (July 28, 2014)). Waiver of late penalties is generally not granted in cases where the 50-percent fraud penalty is imposed. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,621 (Feb. 14, 2018). The Comptroller may also waive interest assessments if there was undue delay caused by Comptroller personnel, reliance on advice provided by the Comptroller's office, or a natural disaster. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34 §3.5. See Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 110,666 (March 13, 2017) (interest was partially waived where an undue delay was found to be on the part of the Comptroller when the Petitioner submitted a timely reply to a the Comptroller's Position Letter and the Comptroller did not issue a reply until a year had passed, a time period well beyond the 45-days set out by Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34 §1.10); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,322 (Aug. 24, 2017) (interest waived where the taxpayer's efforts to resolve the contested issues were encumbered by the unavailability of the auditor's work papers for review). Petitioners requesting a waiver of interest must demonstrate that the waiver is warranted, based on a preponderance of the evidence. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34 §1.40, as repealed by 43 Tex. Reg. 50 (Dec. 14, 2018), and replaced with Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §1.26, effective Jan. 1, 2019. See Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 114,668 (Dec. 14, 2017) (where a relatively new, small, family-run business relied on an outside accountant who did not file sales and use tax reports, penalty waiver is warranted); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,057 (April 28, 2016) (a payroll subsidiary successfully testified that it had no sales or revenue during an audit period and therefore was not a Texas seller or retailer required to file sales tax returns or remit sales tax). But see Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 107,728 (Nov. 8, 2016)(waiver of interest not warranted despite taxpayer claim that records were destroyed in hurricane). Having an audit error rate that is higher than the error rate of a prior audit period does not indicate reasonable diligence. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,522 (Nov. 12, 2015); see also Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 108,455 (June 28, 2016) (despite ALJ's partial adjustment of audit assessment in favor of taxpayer, taxpayer's audit error rate remained high, thus, 10 percent late penalty was not waived). However, having a lower error rate in a subsequent audit is not enough, by itself, to justify a penalty waiver, if the error rate remains high. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,964 (Dec. 8, 2015) (error rate was approximately 65-percent, compared to an earlier error rate of about 96-percent, but the rate remained high; combined with the taxpayer's uncooperative behavior, penalties were not waived).

Yes In 2012, Texas held an amnesty program from June 12, 2012, to Aug. 17, 2012. 2012 Tex. H.B. 1. The Texas Legislature authorized the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts to launch an amnesty program designed to encourage voluntary reporting by delinquent taxpayers who did not hold a permit, or were otherwise not registered for a tax or fee administered by the Comptroller, or those permitted taxpayers that may have underreported or owed additional taxes or fees. 2012 Tex. H.B. 1. Under this authority, the Comptroller launched Project Fresh Start, an amnesty program that ran from June 12, 2012, to Aug. 17, 2012. During this time, taxpayers could pay past due taxes in full and receive waiver of penalty and interest charges normally assessed. Amnesty applied to taxes that were due any time before April 1, 2012. Taxpayers eligible for amnesty included those who did not file a return or report; misrepresented, understated, or omitted any tax liability on a previously filed return; or erroneously claimed credits or deductions. Amnesty was not available for assessments already identified by the Comptroller, underpaid returns (i.e., tax that was reported but not paid), taxpayers currently under audit or review, or taxpayers already contacted by the Comptroller regarding an audit. Further, amnesty was not available for a taxpayer who had signed a settlement agreement or voluntary disclosure agreement before the beginning of the amnesty period. 2012 Tex. H.B. 1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Voluntary Disclosure Relief

Yes Texas provides a Voluntary Disclosure Agreement (VDA) process for taxpayers who want to become compliant with the sales and use tax laws. Texas Tax Publication 96-576. The state adheres to the following general guidelines:• Liabilities due to failure to collect taxes and/or file the applicable reports are limited to reports due four years from the initial taxpayer contact date. • All taxes that were actually collected by the seller need to be remitted (there is no four year limitation on taxes actually collected but not remitted). • Statutory penalties may be waived. • Interest may be waived on taxes voluntarily disclosed and paid that were not previously collected. • Agreements may be offered only to taxpayers who have not been contacted regarding an audit or investigation either verbally or in writing. Texas Tax Publication 96-576. A company representative may initiate the process on behalf of an anonymous client by contacting the Business Activity Research Team (BART). The following information must be provided to begin the process:• the type of entity (corporation, partnership); • a brief description of the company's business including specific activities in Texas; • date the company began business and the date company began business activities in Texas; • whether the company has been contacted by the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts; • whether the company has collected but not remitted any Texas tax; • an estimate of taxes due; • any additional information or extenuating circumstances to support the request. Texas Tax Publication 96-576. Once a determination is made that a taxpayer has complied with the requirements as listed above, preliminary approval will be obtained from the Deputy Comptroller to enter into a VDA. A VDA will be prepared and sent to the company representative with the appropriate tax applications and Texas Nexus Questionnaire for completion and return within 30 days. When the state receives a signed VDA, a package of the appropriate tax applications, and a completed Texas Nexus Questionnaire from the taxpayer, BART will perform an initial review process to determine if the taxpayer has been contacted regarding an audit or investigation that might disqualify them from the process. After eligibility is verified, the VDA is signed and executed by the Manager of Audit. The executed VDA is returned to the taxpayer with the applicable reporting forms and tax data as well as a notice that payment of the disclosed taxes are due to BART within 60 days. Texas Tax Publication 96-576. The Comptroller has the right to deny the waiver of penalty and/or interest or to void the agreement if the taxpayer does not comply with the appropriate policies and procedures. It is also important to note that the disclosure period remains open to future audit. Additionally, any potential issues with full payment of the disclosed taxes must be disclosed in the initial request for a VDA. These policies and procedures may be changed by the Comptroller at any time. Texas Tax Publication 96-576. BNA-SUTN TX 31.15.1.

The MVDP allows taxpayers with outstanding tax liabilities in multiple states to negotiate settlements via a process coordinated by the National Nexus Program (NNP) staff of the MTC. Multistate Tax Commission, Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program. To participate in the MVDP, the taxpayer must:• have a minimum good-faith tax liability estimate of $500 or more; • not have been contacted by a state or commission regarding taxes due;and • submit a completed Voluntary Disclosure Agreement (VDA) including taxpayer's contact information, tax year, list of states to receive the proposed VDA, description of taxpayer's activities in each state, and estimate of taxes due. Multistate Tax Commission, Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program. Texas may have additional requirements for participation in the MVDP. The program is intended to incentivize taxpayers to begin filing and paying taxes in all of the states in which they have substantial nexus. Upon entering into a voluntary disclosure agreement with a state, taxpayers will be required to file returns, pay the tax due and accrued interest on the returns, and register with the state in exchange for waiver of penalties for the entire look-back period. Taxpayers are not charged to participate in the MVDP. Online Marketplace Seller Voluntary Disclosure Initiative—Special MTC Program From Aug. 17, 2017, through Nov. 1, 2017, Texas is participating in the MTC's special limited-time voluntary disclosure initiative in which back sales and use tax liability may be waived for eligible online marketplace sellers that timely register and begin to collect the state's sales and use tax.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Audits

Authorized The Comptroller of Public Accounts may audit a taxpayer's accounts and records at any time during regular business hours. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.282(b). Both sellers and purchasers are subject to audit and assessment of tax on any transactions on which tax was due but has not been paid. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.282(m). The comptroller may proceed against either the seller or purchaser, or both, until the tax, penalty, and interest have been paid. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.282(n). An audit based on a taxpayer's books and other records that is conducted pursuant to established audit methodologies is entitled to a presumption of correctness, and the taxpayer bears the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the audit's results are incorrect. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §1.40(2)(B), as repealed by 43 Tex. Reg. 50 (Dec. 14, 2018), and replaced with Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §1.26, effective Jan. 1, 2019. See Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 114,483 (April 9, 2018) (where taxpayer does not provide any documentary evidence that audit is erroneous, assessment will be upheld); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,970 (Nov. 5, 2015) (taxpayer did not provide evidence showing that an audit's results were incorrect when the audit was based on taxpayer's cash register sales tapes and monthly bank statements for the entire audit period); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,016 (Dec. 16, 2016) (finding that taxpayer's cash disbursement journal numbers, unsupported by any business records, are insufficient to demonstrate error in tax liability estimate); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,820 (Dec. 16, 2016) (taxpayer's deposits determined based on bank records were treated as 100 percent taxable since exemption certificates were not produced to reduce taxable amount). When determining tax due, the Comptroller may use overpayments (including interest) from one or more periods to offset underpayment (including penalties and interest). Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.508; see also Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 107,883 (taxpayer that manufactures and repairs above-ground tanks was entitled to have overpayments for certain periods used to offset underpayments for other periods). The Comptroller may use a detailed auditing procedure or a sample and projection auditing method to determine tax liability. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.282(c). Sampling procedures may include manual sampling techniques and computer-assisted audit techniques, whichever produce the most accurate results in the most efficient manner. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.282(c). A sample and projection auditing method is appropriate if the:• taxpayer's records are so detailed, complex, or voluminous that an audit of all detailed records would be unreasonable or impractical; • taxpayer's records are so inadequate or insufficient that a competent audit would not otherwise be possible; or • cost to audit all detailed records would be unreasonable to the taxpayer or state in relation to the benefits derived, and sampling procedures would produce a reasonable result. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.282(d). A sample and projection audit is appropriate if the taxpayer cannot prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the auditor's sampling method was not in accordance with generally accepted sampling techniques. See, e.g., Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,651 (Sept. 26, 2017) (it was appropriate to use records of supplies and industry standard markup rates where taxpayer failed to show by a preponderance of evidence that the method was in error); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 108,550 (May 23, 2014) (it was appropriate to apply product markup rates to purchase information obtained from a convenience store's vendors when the taxpayer failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the method was incorrect). But see Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,358 (Feb. 1, 2018) (where auditor did not calculate a weighted average pour amount to account for multiple drink services or use calculation methods as prescribed by the audit manual, assessment should be adjusted). In determining tax due, the Comptroller may use the best information available to estimate a taxpayer's liability when records are incomplete or unreliable. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §111.0042(d); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.281(c); see, e.g., Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 115,148 (Feb. 14, 2019) (estimating liability based on a calculated error ratio from taxpayer's prior audit); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 114,498 (May 2, 2018) (estimating sales based on vendor-supplied records and average retail mark up percentages from the National Association of Convenience Stores); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 114,491 (March 16, 2018) (estimating liability based on the gross receipts of other similar local businesses after the taxpayer did not provide any documentation for the audit); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,044 (March 12, 2018) (estimating liability based on the taxpayer's reported gross sales listed on franchise tax returns); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,483 (Jan. 17, 2018); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,442 (Jan. 11, 2018) (using records of taxpayer's suppliers); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,846 (Nov. 3, 2017) (estimate based on vendor-reported purchase data was used because taxpayer provided incomplete records and did not provide sale summaries or register tapes to the auditors). Taxpayers must deliver any exemption certificates to the Comptroller with 60 days after written notice, if not in the taxpayer's possession during the audit. Incomplete or tardy certificates will not be accepted. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 109,946 (Aug. 3, 2018) Taxpayers may not rely on an audit's results as a basis for a future detrimental reliance claim. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 109,946 (Aug. 3, 2018). The Comptroller may authorize taxpayers that meet certain requirements to perform managed audits, Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.282(f). participate in the CPA Audit Program, Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.282(g). or (for direct payment permit-holders)use a percentage-based reporting method. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.282(h). An independent audit review (IAR) is not mandated by the Texas Tax Code or administrative rules, and the opportunity to participate in one does not present a justiciable issue for an administrative law judge to consider. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,483 (March 16, 2018). Settlement in Cases of Insolvency The Texas Comptroller may settle tax, penalties, and interest if collection of the total amount due would make a taxpayer insolvent or if the taxpayer is already insolvent, is in liquidation and has ceased to do business, if the taxpayer has no property that may be seized by the courts or the value of the taxpayer's property is less than the total amount due and the amount of debts against the property. Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 111.102. See Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 107,713 (Feb. 2, 2018) (denying insolvency settlement where the records supplied by taxpayer suggested that the taxpayer had access to additional funds); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,303 (May 8, 2017) (taxpayer had access to other sources of income and capital, via accounts receivable and ownership interests in other entities, that could keep the company solvent; accordingly, taxpayer did not meet the statutory requirement for proof of insolvency). Taxpayers must satisfy certain statutory requirements to qualify for relief. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §1.2, as repealed by 43 Tex. Reg. 50 (Dec. 14, 2018), and replaced with Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §1.30, effective Jan. 1, 2019. See Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,460 (Dec. 12, 2015) (taxpayer did not qualify for insolvency relief because the request did not fully comply with the requirements of Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §1.2(e)); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,545 (Dec. 5, 2016) (taxpayer did not qualify for insolvency relief because supporting documentation, such as tax returns, was not provided in accordance with Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §1.2). For example, a taxpayer must provide financial documentation that supports its insolvency settlement request in order to qualify. See Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,621 (Feb. 14, 2018). A taxpayer will be denied insolvency relief when it has the capacity to generate the funds to pay its full tax liability, by decreasing or eliminating cash distributions to its sole member and renegotiating over-market lease payments to its sole member. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,636 (Nov. 14, 2017). Additionally, where a taxpayer has already paid an assessment and is requesting a refund, the taxpayer will not be granted insolvency relief because the taxpayer cannot claim that it is unable to pay the assessment because of financial hardship. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 115,310 (Sept. 28, 2018). The Texas Comptroller has an established policy to deny insolvency relief when an assessment includes a 50-percent additional penalty. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,621 (Feb. 14, 2018); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,880 (Feb. 28, 2017) (taxpayer provides no evidence to support deviation from policy of denying insolvency settlement requests of taxpayers assessed a 50 percent additional penalty); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,996 (Dec. 12, 2016); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,911 and Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,233 (Sept. 9, 2016)(denying insolvency relief to both corporation and its corporate officer held personally liable for tax delinquency, penalties, and interest); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 106,059 (Apr. 9, 2014). Texas may offer insolvency relief to taxpayers no longer in business, even though the general policy is not to grant insolvency in these types of cases. The Comptroller will make this decision when it is in the state's best interest to offer a settlement. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,728, 112,729 (Feb. 13, 2018) (refusing taxpayer's request on redetermination for an insolvency settlement in order to be consistent with existing Comptroller policy and because Comptroller has the authority to collect taxes owed from successors or corporate officers and directors); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,002 (Aug. 10, 2017) (where the Comptroller has the authority to collect taxes owed from successors, it may deny insolvency settlement to a taxpayer); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,303 (Feb. 23, 2017) (the Comptroller may deny insolvency relief when a Petitioner has access to other sources of income and capital, and when ownership interests in other related entities would derive income); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 107,468 (Nov. 5, 2015). A taxpayer that is unable to demonstrate that its tax liability would render it insolvent cannot qualify for this settlement option. See, e.g., Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 113,428 (Nov. 28, 2017) (insolvency relief denied because taxpayer did not provide the requested documentation to prove insolvency); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,699 (Aug. 6, 2015); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,744 (Sept. 9, 2015); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 111,690 (Sept. 25, 2015); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 107,864 (Mar. 22, 2016) (taxpayer bears the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it qualifies for insolvency relief). An insolvency settlement request must include:copies of the taxpayer's federal income tax returns for the three years immediately prior to the date of the insolvency settlement request; financial statements for the three years immediately prior to the date of the insolvency settlement request and year-to-date financial statements for the period following the taxpayer's last federal income tax return filing; bank statements for the six months immediately prior to the date of the insolvency settlement request; and documentation of assets (including inventory of all property owned, wherever located), liabilities, ongoing financial obligations of the taxpayer, and proof of any claimed insolvency, liquidation, or business cessation. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §1.2(e), as repealed by 43 Tex. Reg. 50 (Dec. 14, 2018), and replaced with Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §1.30, effective Jan. 1, 2019; Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 114,545 (June 11, 2018). BNA-SUTN TX 31.16.
