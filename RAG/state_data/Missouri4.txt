Depends Missouri imposes sales and use tax on sales of aircraft, as aircraft is tangible personal property. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.020. Light Aircraft All sales of new light aircraft, light aircraft kits, and parts manufactured in Missouri that are sold to a qualified purchaser are exempt from tax. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.043.2. “Light aircraft” is defined as a light airplane that seats no more than four persons, with a gross weight of 3,000 pounds or less, that is primarily used for recreational flying or flight training. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.043.1(1). Sales to Nonresidents In addition, aircraft sold to nonresidents of Missouri or corporations that are not incorporated in Missouri are exempt from state and local sales and use tax. In order to qualify for this exemption, the aircraft cannot be based in the state and must be removed from the state within 10 business days of the later of the transfer of title or the return to service for any maintenance, repairs, or installations associated with the transfer of title. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.030.2(44), as amended by 2015 Mo. H.B. 517, effective Aug. 28, 2015. Fractional Ownership The Missouri Supreme Court held in Fall Creek Construction Co. v. Missouri Dir. of Rev., that the purchase of a fractional ownership in an aircraft constituted the purchase of tangible personal property and therefore was subject to tax. Sufficient nexus was found as the plane was used and came to rest in Missouri 42 times. Further, the plane remained overnight in Missouri 24 times during the tax period. Fall Creek Constr. Co. v. Missouri Dir. of Rev., 109 S.W.3d 165 (Mo. 2003). Temporary Presence in State Aircraft sold to nonresidents of Missouri or corporations that are not incorporated in Missouri are exempt from state and local sales and use tax. In order to qualify for this exemption, the aircraft cannot be based in the state and must be removed from the state within 10 business days of the later of the transfer of title or the return to service for any maintenance, repairs, or installations associated with the transfer of title.

Missouri Dir. of Rev., 918 S.W.2d 244 (Mo. 1996)(company that services and repairs industrial equipment does not have to pay sales tax on purchases of parts that it uses as replacements due to installation errors or damage). Sellers of maintenance agreements in which the seller agrees to provide repair services for a lump sum must pay sales tax on all repair parts and other items consumed in the fulfillment of the contract. In Missouri Letter Ruling LR9661, the Missouri Department of Revenue advised that the tax on parts delivered under maintenance contracts applies even when the buyer of the contract is a tax exempt entity such as a not-for-profit hospital.

Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Motor Vehicles, Intrastate or Non-Commercial Use Purchase, Lease, or Rental Transactions

Taxable Missouri imposes sales and use tax on new and used motor vehicles and trailers that are required to be titled in Missouri and purchased for use on Missouri highways. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.020(1)(9); see Missouri Dept. of Rev., Form 4298A:Motor Vehicle Exemptions and Requirements (Oct. 30, 2017). The tax is imposed on the buyer at the time of titling the motor vehicle or trailer, and the seller is not required to collect the tax at the time of the sale. See, e.g., Missouri Letter Ruling LR7859 (July 19, 2017) (seller not responsible for collecting tax on sales of titled motor vehicles or trailers); Missouri Letter Ruling LR7332 (Dec. 12, 2013) (portable sawmills treated as vehicles, requiring sales tax at the time of titling, rather than at the point of sale by the vendor). The tax is imposed on the purchase price, less trade-in allowance. If a vehicle is purchased from an out-of-state dealer and the buyer has a trade-in, the buyer must present proof of the trade-in to receive a tax credit when he or she titles the vehicle in Missouri. Buying a Vehicle: A Guide to Missouri Title and Registration. “Motor vehicle”is defined as “any vehicle, truck, truck-tractor, motor bus, or any self-propelled vehicle and trailers or semi-trailers used upon the highways of the state in transportation of property or passengers.” Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-110.300(2)(D). This motor vehicle sales tax does not apply to:• motor vehicles, trailers, boats, or outboard motors brought into Missouri from another state which were registered and operated in the other state at least 90 days prior to registration in Missouri; • motor vehicles, trailers, boats, or outboard motors acquired by registered dealers for resale; • motor vehicles, trailers, boats, or outboard motors purchased, owned or used by any religious, charitable, eleemosynary institution for use in the conduct of regular religious, charitable or eleemosynary functions and activities; • motor vehicles owned and used by religious organizations in transferring pupils to and from schools supported by such organizations; • motor vehicles, trailers, or boats which have been acquired for a certificate of title by gift or under a will or by inheritance, and the 4 percent sales tax has already been paid by the donor or decedent; • any motor vehicle, trailer, boat, or outboard motor owned or used by Missouri or any of its political subdivisions, or by an educational institution supported by public funds; • farm tractors; • motor vehicles, trailers, boats, or outboard motors owned and used by not-for-profit civic, social, service, or fraternal organizations in their civic or charitable functions and activities; • motor vehicles, trailers, boats, or outboard motors owned and used by any private, not-for-profit elementary school, secondary school, or institution of higher education in the conduct of their educational functions and activities; • motor vehicles, trailers, boats or outboard motors owned and used by any elementary school, secondary school, or institution of higher education in the conduct of their educational functions and activities that are supported by public funds; or • any transfer of motor vehicles, trailers, boats, or outboard motors between corporations and shareholders as set forth in Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.617. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.050; as amended by 2015 Mo. H.B. 869, effective Aug. 28, 2015. However, semi-trailer trucks registered and capable of hauling more than 54,000 pounds are exempt from sales tax. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.030.2(4); Missouri Letter Ruling LR7933 (April 4, 2018); Missouri Letter Ruling LR7324. Street sweepers are special mobile equipment and are not required to be registered or titled in Missouri. Therefore, a street sweeper purchaser should pay sales tax directly to a dealership at the time of purchase. If the purchaser buys a street sweeper from a private third party or from a dealership located outside Missouri, the purchaser should self-accrue and pay use tax. Missouri Letter Ruling LR7906 (Jan. 4, 2018); Missouri Letter Ruling LR7439 (Nov. 17, 2014). Trade-In Credit The trade-in provision applies to motor vehicles sold by the owner, if the seller purchases or contracts to purchase a subsequent motor vehicle within 180 days before or after the date of the original article's sale. The taxable purchase price of the motor vehicle, trailer, boat, or outboard motor purchased or contracted to be purchased may only be reduced by the amount for which the purchaser sells one other such article, even if the purchaser sells multiple such articles within 180 days of his purchase. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.025.1; Kehlenbrink v. Missouri Dir. of Rev., No. SC97287, 2019 BL 237909 (Mo. June 25, 2019); Missouri Administrative Decision 12-2234-RV; Missouri Administrative Decision 13-1022-RV (taxpayer could not take an additional sales tax credit for the sale of a motor vehicle against the purchase of a new motor vehicle where the taxpayer had already claimed a sales tax credit against the purchase for a previous motor vehicle sale); Missouri Letter Ruling LR7173 (Nov. 29, 2012) (construction equipment does not qualify for credit because an excavator is not considered a motor vehicle). Farm Products Used as Trade-In Tax Credit Missouri provides a sales tax credit when grain or livestock raised or produced by the purchaser is traded for a vehicle purchased from a dealer for agricultural use. To receive this credit, the following criteria must be met:• the grain or livestock must be traded to the dealer within one week of the actual purchase date of the vehicle; • the vehicle being purchased must be used for agricultural use; • the purchaser of the vehicle must have either raised or produced the agricultural product; and • the purchaser must submit a Bill of Transfer (Farm Products Only) (Form 4606), in which the purchaser certifies the information noted above. Missouri Motor Vehicle and Marinecraft Titling Manual. Replacement Vehicle The seller of a motor vehicle, trailer, vessel(watercraft), or outboard motor who purchases or contracts to purchase a subsequent unit may receive a tax credit if the subsequent unit is purchased or contracted to purchase within 180 days before or after the date the original unit is sold. The actual sale price of the unit will be deducted from the purchase price of the new unit for the purposes of calculating tax. The applicant must submit a bill of sale or notice of sale with the application for title to receive the tax credit. Missouri does not restrict the tax credit to “exact or like”replacement units, i.e., a motor vehicle for a motor vehicle, trailer for trailer, etc. Accordingly, an individual can sell a boat and buy a motor vehicle or trailer or vice versa and still qualify for the tax credit. The unit being purchased or contracted to purchase must be titled in at least one of the owners’ names as the unit being replaced (or sold) to qualify for a tax credit. Missouri Motor Vehicle and Marinecraft Titling Manual. Total Loss Credit The purchaser of a motor vehicle, trailer, vessel, or outboard motor may deduct the amount of a total loss claim settlement received from an insurance company plus the owner's deductible from the purchase price of another like unit that is purchased or contracted to purchase after the total loss occurs, but within 180 days before or after the date of the total loss claim settlement. The total loss statement can be in anyone's name; however, at least one of the owners of the total loss vehicle must be the same on the application for title on the newly acquired vehicle. Missouri Motor Vehicle and Marinecraft Titling Manual. Temporary Presence in State If a person purchases a motor vehicle or trailer, and, before titling and registering it in Missouri, moves and titles it out-of-state within 30 days of the purchase, no Missouri tax is due. Further, motor vehicles, trailers, boats, or outboard motors brought into Missouri from another state which were registered and operated in the other state at least 90 days prior to registration in Missouri are exempt from tax. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-103.350. Rescission of Motor Vehicle Sale A purchaser who rescinds the sale of a motor vehicle, trailer, boat, or outboard motor will be refunded the sales or use tax paid if the return occurred within 60 calendar days from the date of the sale. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.071. Motor Vehicle Leases Generally The owner of any motor vehicle, trailer, boat, or outboard motor that is to be used exclusively for rental or lease purposes may pay the sales tax due at the time of registration or may pay tax on the proceeds from lease or rental contracts. A use tax must be charged and paid on the amount charged for each rental or lease agreement while the motor vehicle, trailer, boat, or outboard motor is domiciled in the state. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.440(5). Sales tax will not be assessed on a vehicle acquired for lease or rental by registered Missouri motor vehicle or marinecraft leasing companies. Missouri Motor Vehicle and Marinecraft Titling Manual. If a leasing company that rents or leases motor vehicles, trailers, boats, or outboard motors chooses to collect a use tax, all of its lease receipts are subject to the use tax, regardless of whether or not the leasing company previously paid a sales tax when the vehicle, trailer, boat, or outboard motor was originally purchased. The rental receipts or purchase price (depending on the sales tax option the leasing company selected) for leases of 60 days or more must be based on the lessee's address. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.440.6; Missouri Motor Vehicle and Marinecraft Titling Manual. Taxability of Fees Related to Motor Vehicle Leases The taxability of fees for a service is determined by whether the parties intend for the service to be part of the transaction, regardless of whether the fee is separately stated. Fees for mechanical breakdown coverage agreements, extended service agreements, and pre-paid maintenance plans are considered to be part of a motor vehicle lease and are subject to tax. Alberici Constructors, Inc. v. Dir. of Rev., 452 S.W.3d 632, 2015 BL 7099 (Mo. 2015) (noting a regulation which determined taxability of services based on whether the charge was separately stated was “at odds” with the intent of the legislature); Missouri Letter Ruling LR7939 (April 18, 2018). An audible alarm system, a navigation system, and theft deterrent and recovery products are subject to sales tax because they become part of the leased vehicle. A documentation fee is also subject to sales tax because it is a fee that must be paid when the dealer sells a motor vehicle to a lessee. In addition, administration/acquisition fees, excess mileage fees, excess wear and tear fees, financed sales tax fees, lien fees, and titling fees, if paid, are subject to sales tax. Insurance proceeds are taxable if any lease balance remains as the insurance proceeds are used to reduce the lease balance due. BNA-SUTN MO 29.3.1.

Missouri does not provide an exception for fuel used by motor vehicle common carriers, however, in general, fuel or special fuel that is subject to a motor fuel or special fuel tax is not subject to the sales tax. If the special fuel has no special fuel tax imposed or if the special fuel tax is refunded, the special fuel is subject to sales tax, unless otherwise exempted. Mo. Rev. Stat. §142.803(1); Mo. Rev.

Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-110.300(2)(F). Sales tax is due on new and used boats and outboard motors that are required to be titled in Missouri and purchased for use on Missouri waters. The tax is imposed on the buyer at the time of titling boat or outboard motor. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.020(1)(9); Missouri Letter Ruling LR7332 (portable sawmills treated as vehicles, requiring sales tax at the time of titling, rather than at the point of sale by the vendor). This tax does not apply to:• boats or outboard motors brought into Missouri from another state which were registered and operated in the other state at least 90 days prior to registration in Missouri; • boats or outboard motors acquired by registered dealers for resale; • boats or outboard motors purchased, owned or used by any religious, charitable, eleemosynary institution for use in the conduct of regular religious, charitable or eleemosynary functions and activities; • motor vehicles owned and used by religious organizations in transferring pupils to and from schools supported by such organizations; • boats which have been acquired for a certificate of title by gift or under a will or by inheritance, and the 4 percent sales tax has already been paid by the donor or decedent; • any boat or outboard motor owned or used by Missouri or any of its political subdivisions, or by an educational institution supported by public funds; • boats or outboard motors owned and used by not-for-profit civic, social, service, or fraternal organizations in their civic or charitable functions and activities; • boats or outboard motors owned and used by any private, not-for-profit elementary school, secondary school, or institution of higher education in the conduct of their educational functions and activities; • boats or outboard motors owned and used by any elementary school, secondary school, or institution of higher education in the conduct of their educational functions and activities that are supported by public funds; or • any transfer of boats or outboard motors between corporations and shareholders as set forth in Mo.

If a leasing company that rents or leases motor vehicles, trailers, boats, or outboard motors elects to collect a use tax, all of its lease receipts are subject to the use tax, regardless of whether or not the leasing company previously paid a sales tax when the vehicle, trailer, boat, or outboard motor was originally purchased. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.440.6. Boats and Outboard Motor Rentals Missouri does not impose sales and use tax on rentals and leases of boats and outboard motors in places of amusement, entertainment, or recreation. Those transactions are not considered to be sales. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.020.1(8).
