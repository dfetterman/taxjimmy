Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Real Property

Nontaxable Real property is not subject to the retailers' occupation tax, use tax, service occupation tax, and service use tax because those taxes only apply to tangible personal property. 35 ILCS 120/2; 35 ILCS 105/3; 35 ILCS 115/3; 35 ILCS 110/3. A permanent improvement to realty made by a seller/contractor of the tangible personal property which is incorporated into the realty by that seller or contractor is not subject to Illinois’ retailers’ occupation tax or use tax. Illinois General Information Letter ST 09-0145-GIL (Nov. 3, 2009); see also Klein Town Builders, Inc. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 36 Ill. 2d 301 (1967); Craftmaster, Inc. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 269 Ill. App. 3d 934 (4th Dist. 1995); Spurgeon v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 52 Ill. App. 3d 29 (3rd Dist. 1977). Real Property Compared to Tangible Personal Property The Retailers' Occupation Tax Act does not expressly define the terms “real property”or “tangible personal property.” Courts in Illinois have interpreted tangible personal property to mean “corporeal property either real or personal.” Illinois defines the term “corporeal”as “of the nature of, consisting of, or pertaining to, matter or a material body; physical; bodily; material—opposed to spiritual or immaterial . . . tangible or palpable.” Farrand Coal Co. v. Halpin, 10 Ill. 2d 507, 140 N.E.2d 698 (Ill. 1957); see also Exelon Corp. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 234 Ill. 2d 266, 917 N.E.2d 899 (Ill. 2009) (holding under this definition that electricity constitutes tangible personal property), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 1699 (2010). “Structure”is defined as any building, house, edifice, tunnel, sewer, highway, road, bridge or any other type of structure, or any part thereof (including any system of plumbing, heating, ventilating, refrigerating, air conditioning, or any part thereof), or any other improvement to real estate. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.1940(a)(4). BNA-SUTN IL 28.1.

Taxable Sales of fixtures and other tangible personal property to contractors, builders or developers for conversion into real estate are subject to sales and use tax. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2075(a)(1); Illinois General Information Letter ST 14-0007-GIL (March 7, 2014). When a construction contractor permanently affixes tangible personal property to real property, the contractor incurs use tax liability as the end user of the property but not retailers' occupation tax liability. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.1940(c); Illinois General Information Letter ST 18-0006-GIL (March 27, 2018); Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0063-GIL (Oct. 29. 2015). For an item to be considered “incorporated”into real estate, it must be permanently affixed, and there must be an intent for the item to remain with the real estate. One indication of such an intent is that damage to the real estate would result if a permanently affixed item were removed. Illinois Private Letter Ruling ST 13-0002-PLR (July 31, 2013); Illinois General Information Letter ST 95-0144-GIL (March 15, 1995);Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0063-GIL (Oct. 29, 2015) (stating that if an item is attached to a wall using only an anti-tip bracket attached with two screws, it seems likely that item could be removed without damaging the item or the real estate and therefore not a permanently affixed as to become a part of the realty). Persons who engage in selling building materials, fixtures, plants and other tangible personal property to construction contractors, speculative builders or real estate developers, who convert the items into real estate, incur retailers' occupation tax liability when making these sales. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2075(a)(1). Custom built floor-based closet products that are not permanently affixed to real property also are generally subject to the retailers' occupation tax. Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0063-GIL (Oct. 29. 2015).

Code tit. 86, §130.2140(b)(1); Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0063-GIL (Oct. 29. 2015). Installation charges for such items are deductible from total receipts in computing retailers’ occupation tax liability if the charges are contracted for by the seller and the purchaser separately from the selling price of the finished tangible personal property, but are taxable if included in a lump sum price. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2140(b)(2); Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0063-GIL (Oct. 29. 2015).

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Construction Materials and Contracts Construction Materials and Contracts, Generally

Nontaxable Charges for construction labor billed to a contractee are not subject to Illinois'retailers' occupation or service occupation tax. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.1940(c); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §140.125(j). However, when a construction contractor permanently affixes tangible personal property to real property, the contractor is deemed the end user of that tangible personal property. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.1940(c); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2075(a)(1); Illinois General Information Letter ST 17-0017-GIL (June 2, 2017) (out-of-state subcontractor owes use tax on counter top installed in Illinois residence;credit available for tax paid to another state). It is immaterial whether the contract is a time-and-material or lump-sum contract. Illinois General Information Letter ST 09-0053-GIL (April 1, 2009). As the end user, the contractor incurs use tax on the cost price of that tangible personal property. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.1940(c). For example, a contractor does not incur retailers' occupation tax liability when he sells and installs doors and windows; weather stripping; insulation material;awnings; Venetian blinds or window shades; cabinets built into the structure; floor coverings that are permanently affixed to the structure;and most items associated with the plumbing or electrical systems of the structure. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.1940(c)(1). By contrast, items such as drapes, floor coverings that are not permanently affixed to the structure, refrigerators, stoves, washing machines or any other portable equipment are considered to remain personal property when installed and do not become part of the finished structure. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 130.1940(b)(2). A contractor may not charge use tax to the customer. However, the contractor may pass the tax along in the overall price for the services provided or include a contract provision that requires the customer to “reimburse”the construction contractor for tax liability. This reimbursement must be listed on the customer's bill as a reimbursement of tax. Illinois General Information Letter ST 13-0066-GIL (Oct. 7, 2013); Illinois General Information Letter ST 14-0007-GIL (March 7, 2014). Construction contractors incur retailers' occupation tax liability when they engage in selling any kind of tangible personal property without installation to purchasers for use or consumption. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.1940(b)(1). Sales of materials to construction contractors are not taxable if the contractor resells the property to customers as tangible personal property. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.1940(c); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §150.1201. If it is unknown at the time of purchase whether or not the property will be resold, the contractor may certify to the seller that the purchase is for resale and the contractor will subsequently be liable for the sales tax on items as they are sold at retail. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2075(b). Use Tax Materials bought by a contractor outside of Illinois which are then brought into and used in Illinois for building purposes are subject to the use tax. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2075(c). The contractor does not have to pay use tax if sales tax was paid in the other state at a rate that is equal to or greater than that of Illinois. If the contractor has already paid a tax in another state regarding the purchase or use of such property, the contractor is entitled to a credit against Illinois use tax liability to the extent that she has paid tax that was properly due to another state. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §150.310; Illinois General Information Letter ST 14-0007-GIL (March 7, 2014). General contractors that make purchases of materials and then subcontract the installation owe use tax on the installed materials. Illinois General Information Letter ST 14-0003-GIL (March 3, 2014). If a contractor does not pay the use tax liability to his/her suppliers, the contractor must self-assess use tax liability and pay it directly to the department. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §150.310; Illinois General Information Letter ST 14-0007-GIL (March 7, 2014). If subcontractors are utilized and are acting as construction contractors, the transaction between the general contractors and the subcontractors is not a taxable transaction. The subcontractors incur use tax liability on any tangible personal property that they purchase for incorporation into real estate. If, however, general contractors make purchases and then contract to have subcontractors do the installation, the general contractors incur use tax liability because they are making the purchases of such tangible personal property. Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0032-GIL (June 18, 2015). Sales of Building Materials to a High Impact Business Illinois exempts sales of building materials that will be incorporated into a High Impact Business (HIB) location. 35 ILCS 120/5l; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 130.1952(a).

Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 130.1952(e). Ineligible Sales Items that are not physically incorporated into an HIB location cannot qualify for the exemption. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 130.1952(f). Sales of Building Materials Incorporated into Real Estate within River Edge Redevelopment Zones Illinois exempts qualified sales of building materials to be incorporated into real estate within a River Edge Redevelopment Zone by remodeling, rehabilitating, or new construction. 35 ILCS 120/2-54; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 130.1954(a)(1). A “qualified sale” means a sale of building materials that will be incorporated into real estate as part of an industrial or commercial project for which a Certificate of Eligibility for Sales Tax Exemption has been issued by the corporate authorities of the municipality in which the building project is located before July 1, 2013, and for which a River Edge Building Materials Exemption Certificate has been issued by the department on or after July 1, 2013. 35 ILCS 120/2-54; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 130.1954(a)(2); see also Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 130.1954(a)(3) (defining the phrase “industrial project”); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 130.1954(a)(4) (defining the phrase “commercial project”); Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0071-GIL (Oct. 15, 2015) (exemption is limited to building materials incorporated into real estate as part of an industrial or commercial project, and does not include materials incorporated as part of a residential project). To qualify for the deduction, the materials being purchased must be building materials, meaning that they must be purchased for physical incorporation into real estate. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 130.1954(b)(1). Ineligible Sales Items that are not physically incorporated into the real estate cannot qualify for the exemption. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 130.1954(b)(2). Further, building materials incorporated into stand-alone residential homes, residential apartments, residential condominiums, residential townhouses, residential duplexes, residential buildings or residential structures do not qualify for the exemption. Building materials physically incorporated into a commercial project, a portion of which is dedicated for residential purposes, shall be allocated on a square-footage basis for common building materials(e.g., lumber, cement, bricks, insulation, air conditioning and heating equipment serving an entire project and roofing materials)and directly allocated to either the commercial portion or residential portion when direct allocation of the building materials is possible(e.g., bathtubs, sinks, lavatories, cabinets, built-in appliances and air conditioning and heating equipment serving individually owned or leased units or space). Only the building materials allocated to the commercial portion of the project can qualify for the exemption. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 130.1954(b)(3); see Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0071-GIL (Oct. 15, 2015) (River Edge Development Zone exemption limited to building materials incorporated into real estate as part of an industrial or commercial project, and does not include materials incorporated as part of a residential project;exemption allowed for commercial portion of a multi-use development project that also includes residential units).
