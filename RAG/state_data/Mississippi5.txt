Taxable Mississippi generally imposes a contractor's tax of 3.5 percent on the total consideration received by a contractor under a non-residential real property contract providing for payment exceeding $10,000. Miss. Code Ann. §27-65-21(1)(a); Miss. Code Ann. §27-65-21(1)(b). However, the following receipts are not subject to the contractor's tax:• the portion of a contract price attributable to design or engineering services if the total contract price for the project exceeds one hundred million dollars; and • amounts received to restore, repair, or replace a utility distribution or transmission system that has been damaged due to a natural disaster, provided that such restoration, repair, or replacement is performed by the contractor at cost. Miss. Code Ann. §27-65-21(1)(b). For contracts exceeding$75,000, either the contractor's tax must be prepaid before work begins or the contractor must file a surety bond with the Department of Revenue. Mississippi Sales and Use Fact Sheet - Swimming Pools. More information on the taxation of construction contractors is available at 1840 T.M., State Taxation of Construction Contractors. A person constructing buildings on property that the person owns is not a contractor and is liable for the retail sales or use tax on all materials or services purchased even though the person may enter into a contract to sell the building and lot before construction is completed. Miss. Regs. §35.IV.10.01.701. Purchases by contractors and subcontractors of work equipment, tools, building forms, repair parts for work equipment and similar tangible personal property that do not become a component part of the structure being erected are taxed at the regular retail rate of sales or use tax. When property of this type has been previously used in another state and is imported into Mississippi for use, the use tax is due on the fair market value of the property at the time of importation. At no time shall the value be less than 20 percent of original cost. Credit for sales or use tax paid to another state in which the property was acquired or used may be taken in computing the amount of use tax due Mississippi. The credit must be computed by applying the rate of sales or use tax paid to another state to the value of the property at the time it enters Mississippi. Miss. Regs. §35.IV.10.01.901. Subcontractors Subcontractors performing work on a qualified prime contract owe no tax on the subcontract unless the prime contractor fails to pay the tax due. Miss. Regs. §35.IV.10.01.205. Contracts with Exempt Entities Construction contracts with the United States Government, the State of Mississippi, or any other political subdivision, or any other exempt agency are subject to Mississippi's 3.5-percent contractor's tax the same as construction contracts generally.
