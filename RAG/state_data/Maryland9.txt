Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

Predominant Purpose Test Maryland applies the “predominant purpose test” as its version of the true object test in determining the taxability of transactions involving tangible personal property and a nontaxable service or intangible property. Quotron Sys., Inc. v. Maryland Comp. of Treas., 411 A.2d 439 (Md. 1980). If the dominant purpose in entering into the transaction is to obtain a nontaxable service or intangible property, the transaction is not taxable. Quotron Sys., Inc. v. Maryland Comp. of Treas., 411 A.2d 439 (Md. 1980). The Maryland Court of Appeals held that the dominant purpose test should be used to determine whether a transaction of both tangible personal property and nontaxable property or services is subject to the state's sales tax. Quotron Sys., Inc. v. Maryland Comp. of Treas., 411 A.2d 439 (Md. 1980). If the dominant purpose of the transaction is a sale of tangible personal property, then the transaction is taxable. However, if the dominant purpose of the transaction is the sale of a nontaxable service or nontaxable property then the transaction is not subject to sales tax. Quotron Sys., Inc. v. Maryland Comp. of Treas., 411 A.2d 439 (Md. 1980). In Quotron Systems, Inc. v. Maryland Comp. of Treas., the taxpayer made computer hardware available to its subscribers to access its services. At issue was whether Quotron provided hardware that is taxable tangible personal property or nontaxable services. Quotron Sys., Inc. v. Maryland Comp. of Treas., 411 A.2d 439 (Md. 1980). The court applied the dominant purpose of the contract to determine the taxability. Quotron's hardware was provided solely for its customers to use the financial information services provided by Quotron. Quotron Sys., Inc. v. Maryland Comp. of Treas., 411 A.2d 439 (Md. 1980). The court was persuaded that the dominant purpose of the contract was services because the hardware provided could be used by clients to receive information only without the ability to exercise much control over the hardware. Quotron Sys., Inc. v. Maryland Comp. of Treas., 411 A.2d 439 (Md. 1980). Moreover, the services offered by Quotron required the use of the hardware and was not available without it, therefore, the dominant purpose intended by the parties was to render a service and not to rent hardware. Quotron Sys., Inc. v. Maryland Comp. of Treas., 411 A.2d 439 (Md. 1980). BNA-SUTN MD 9.3.1.

Taxable Typically bundled transactions are a retail sale involving two or more items sold for one non-itemized price. Md. Code Ann. Tax-Gen. §11-102. However, the examples below represent the bundled transactional treatment in different contexts: Bundled Software and Services: In Maryland Comp. of Treas. v. Equitable Trust. Co., the court dealt with a bundled transaction involving the licensing of canned computer programs. Maryland Comp. of Treas. v. Equitable Trust Co., 464 A.2d 248 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1983). Equitable Trust and Auxton Computer Enterprises entered into a license agreement, in which Auxton Computer Enterprises granted Equitable the nontransferable and nonexclusive right to use their computer program, which was delivered on magnetic tape. Maryland Comp. of Treas. v. Equitable Trust Co., 464 A.2d 248 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1983). At issue was whether the dominant purpose of the transaction was the taxable tangible personal property or the nontaxable intangible computer program. Maryland Comp. of Treas. v. Equitable Trust Co., 464 A.2d 248, 249 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1983). The court acknowledged that the dominant purpose of the transaction was the intangible program; however, the court would not sever the information from the tangible medium and therefore the sale was a taxable transaction. Mobile Telecommunications: The bundled sale of mobile telecommunications and services are taxable if the nontaxable services are not separately stated and identifiable. Md. Regs. Code §03.06.01.40. Internet Access: The bundled sale of exempt internet access with taxable charges of communication services is taxable if not separately stated from charges for telecommunication services. Md. Regs. Code §03.06.01.40. BNA-SUTN MD 9.3.2.
