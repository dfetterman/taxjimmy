Accepted An exempt purchaser who holds an exemption certificates and who regularly makes tax exempt purchases of the kind and nature for which the exemption certificate has been made may provide a seller with a blanket exemption certificate. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-517(d); Ark. Regs. GR-79(F)(1)(c). A blanket certificate is valid as long as there is not a period greater than 12 months between transactions. A blanket certificate specifies that all tangible personal property subsequently purchased will be for the purpose shown on the certificate, such as a purchase for resale. This relieves the purchaser of providing a separate exemption certificate for each qualifying tax exempt purchase, as long as there is no change in the character of their operations. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-517(d); Ark. Regs. GR-79(F)(1)(c). Other types of blank certificates include:• Commercial Farm Exemption Certificate (Arkansas Form ST-403); • Farm Utility Exemption (Arkansas Form ET-1441 A); and • Grain Drying and Storage Exemption (Arkansas Form ET-1401 A).

Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-509(a). Instead, the purchaser is required to remit the applicable use tax directly to the Department of Finance and Administration. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-509(a)(1)(A), as amended by 2015 Ark. S.B. 332, effective April 6, 2015. Further, the Director of the Department of Finance and Administration may issue limited direct pay permits that allow the user or consumer to accrue and remit sales and use taxes on eligible purchases. “Eligible purchases”includes property or services subject to a tax refund for partial replacement and repair of certain machinery and equipment under Ark.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Record-Keeping Requirements

6 Years Arkansas requires individuals and businesses making taxable sales to keep and preserve suitable records of the proceeds of sales or gross receipts of sales. Ark. Code Ann. §26-18-506(a); Ark. Regs. GR-80. This includes any books or other accounts that may be necessary to determine the amount of tax for which he or she is liable. Ark. Code Ann. §26-18-506(a); Ark. Regs. GR-80(C)(1). Records must be retained for at least six years from the date a return is filed, unless the Director has provided in writing that the records are no longer required. Ark. Code Ann. §26-18-506(b); Ark. Regs. GR-80(J). If a taxpayer's records do not adequately reflect sales and use tax liability, the director may make an estimated assessment based on available information. Ark. Code Ann. §26-18-506(d); see Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 17-220 (March 28, 2017) (upholding sales tax assessment due to inadequate records); see also Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-265 (May 25, 2018) (assessment upheld where taxpayer failed to submit requested records, and submitted only portions of its bookkeeping records, which conflicted with other records available to the department). Additionally, taxpayers using cash-basis returns must keep accurate records that reflect the amount of cash sales and credit sales. Ark. Regs. GR-78. Out-of-State Records Taxpayers that choose to store necessary records outside the state of Arkansas must produce the records within 15 days after receipt of demand by the director of the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration. However, if the taxpayer believes that producing the required records within Arkansas is impractical, the taxpayer may request permission from the director to have an audit conducted where the records are located. Ark. Code Ann. §26-18-506(c). Rebates to Businesses for Additional Local Taxes Paid on Purchases Businesses may claim a rebate or refund of local sales taxes paid for “business expenses,” where the invoice exceeds $2,500. Ark.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Refunds

Vendor For sales tax, only the vendor who collected and remitted the erroneously paid sales tax or the vendor's assignee may file a refund claim with the Department of Finance and Administration. Ark. Regs. GR-81.1(C); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 17-084 (June 15, 2017). A request for a refund of taxes paid under a direct pay permit must be made by the holder of the permit. For use tax, the taxpayer who remitted the tax to the department is the only person eligible to request a refund. Ark. Regs. GR-81.1(C); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 17-084 (June 15, 2017). Taxpayers who have paid sales or use tax, and who believe an overpayment has occurred, may file a petition for a refund with the department within the normal three year statute of limitations period. Ark. Regs. GR-83(B). However, if a final assessment has been issued by the department, the taxpayer may only submit the petition for refund if all taxes plus interest have been repaid to the customers, or has obtained the consent of such persons to receive the refund. Taxpayers who believe they are due a refund because of an overpayment must file an amended return or verified claim for refund. The refund claim must specify the name of the taxpayer, the period for which the tax was paid, the amount of the overpayment, and the grounds upon which a refund is claimed. The Director will make a written response concerning the refund within 6 months of the claim. If a refund is granted the interest on overpayments is 10 percent, however, if refunded within 90 days after filing the return there is no interest applied to the overpayment. Ark. Regs. GR-83(A), (B). The Arkansas State Claims Commission does not have any jurisdiction for claims for state refunds or challenges to tax assessments. Ark. Code Ann. §19-10-204(b)(8), as amended by 2019 Ark. H.B. 1661, effective April 8, 2019.

In addition, if a responsible party understates the total amount of sales tax due on a sales tax return by 25 percent or more, then the Department of Finance and Administration can make an assessment within six years after the due date of the return, or the date the return was filed, whichever is later. Ark. Code Ann. §26-18-306(e). The limitations period for assessing tax also applies to the recovery of an erroneous refund issued to a taxpayer. However, if the refund was paid due to fraud or misrepresentation by the taxpayer, Arkansas can make an assessment of tax that seeks recovery of the refund at any time. Ark. Code Ann. § 26-18-306(n), as added by 2017 Ark. H.B. 1681, effective July 30, 2017. Waiving the Statute of Limitations If no return is filed, or if a fraudulent return is filed, then the Department of Finance and Administration may make an assessment at any time.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Waiver of Penalties

Yes Penalties may be abated for reasonable cause. However, lack of knowledge of Arkansas' tax regulations or statutes is not reasonable cause, and is not sufficient to support the abatement of a penalty otherwise due. Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 17-198 (March 27, 2017). The Arkansas Director of the Department of Finance and Administration must either publish a list of the Universal Product Codes for candy and soda or waive penalties imposed on certain retailers that collect sales tax at the reduced rate imposed on food generally.

The program is intended to incentivize taxpayers to begin filing and paying taxes in all of the states in which they have substantial nexus. Upon entering into a voluntary disclosure agreement with a state, taxpayers will be required to file returns, pay the tax due and accrued interest on the returns, and register with the state in exchange for waiver of penalties for the entire look-back period. Taxpayers are not charged to participate in the MVDP.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Audits

Authorized For the purpose of determining the correct amount of sales and use tax due, the Department of Revenue has the authority to examine and audit the records, books, or other relevant information that taxpayers are required to maintain relating to sales and use tax. Ark. Code Ann. §26-18-301; Ark. Code Ann. §26-18-305; Ark. Regs. GR-78(D). Also, the Department of Revenue has the authority to summon records, books, and witnesses to give testimony necessary to determine the correct sales and use tax owed. Ark. Code Ann. §26-18-305. The taxpayer bears the burden of refuting the Department of Finance and Administration's estimated assessment by providing sufficient credible evidence to establish that the audit results are unreasonable. Ark. Code Ann. §26-18-506(d). See also Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-141 (Feb. 27, 2018) (self-serving testimony, standing alone, is insufficient to refute an estimated assessment); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 16-256 (June 15, 2016) (taxpayer did not provide evidence refuting an assessment's results when the taxpayer offered no physical evidence or witness testimony). The department and the taxpayer may agree to audit a sample period for use in extrapolating the taxpayer's tax liability; such an agreement is binding on the parties. Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-160 (Feb. 14, 2018); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-166 (Feb. 14, 2018). Statute of Limitations Under most circumstances, the Department of Finance and Administration may make an assessment of unpaid sales or use taxes for three years following the due date of the return or the date the return was filed, whichever is later. Ark. Code Ann. §26-18-306(a)(1). However, records must be retained for at least six years from the date a return is filed, and the department may examine records at any reasonable time. Ark. Code Ann. §26-18-506(b). Audit Expenses A taxpayer that requests a summons must bear the expense of producing records of a third party. However, if the Director initiates the summons for third-party records, the state bears the cost of reasonable expenses for producing the records. The Director may later assess record reproduction costs against the delinquent or deficient taxpayer. Ark. Code Ann. §26-18-305(h). BNA-SUTN AR 31.16.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Appeals

Permitted If a taxpayer disagrees with any proposed assessment of taxes or denial of a claim for refund by the Director of the Department of Finance and Administration, the taxpayer may request a hearing with the Director to review documents furnished by the taxpayer or the taxpayer may file a written protest with the Director within 60 days of the notice date. Ark. Code Ann. §26-18-404. The Director, in his or her discretion, may extend the time to file a protest for any period of time not to exceed an additional 90 days. Ark. Code Ann. §26-18-405. At the hearing, the hearing officer will review all written protests and make written findings regarding the proposed assessment or the denial of a claim for refund. The hearing officer's decision is final unless revised by the Director. Ark. Code Ann. §26-18-405. After the issuance and service of the final assessment of a deficiency of tax or a final determination by the hearing officer or Director, a taxpayer may:• file suit for judicial relief within 180 days of the date of the final assessment or determination; • pay the entire amount of state tax due within one year of the date of the final assessment or determination and file suit to recover that amount within one year of the date of payment; or • file suit to recover assessed tax, penalty, and interest paid prior to the issuance of the final assessment within one year of the final determination of the hearing officer or the Director. Ark. Code Ann. §26-18-406(a). The burden of proof applied to matters of fact and evidence, whether placed on the taxpayer or the state in controversies regarding the application of a state tax law is by the preponderance of the evidence. Ark. Code Ann. §26-18-313(c); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-269 (April 30, 2018). Reliance on Legal Opinions In Arkansas, a legal opinion issued by the department may only be relied upon by a seller if it is addressed to that seller or tendered to the seller by a customer to whom it is addressed, and only to the extent that all material facts related to the transaction at issue are addressed by both the legal opinion request and the legal opinion. Also, opinions may only be relied upon for up to three years from the date of issuance; however, they may be renewed upon request. Ark. Regs. GR-75. Estoppel Defense In Russellville, Ark. v. Hodges, the Arkansas Supreme Court set forth the following four elements needed to establish estoppel:1) The party to be estopped must know the facts. 2) The party to be estopped must intend that the conduct be acted on or must act so that the party asserting the estoppel had a right to believe it was so intended. 3)The party asserting the estoppel must be ignorant of the facts. 4)The party asserting the estoppel must rely on the other's conduct and be injured by that reliance. Russellville, Ark. v. Hodges, 957 S.W.2d 690, 330 Ark. 716 (Ark. 1997); see Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-159 (May 24, 2018) (elements of estoppel not met because taxpayer was unable to show that the Department of Revenue employee knew the full facts of the case when he communicated with the taxpayer). Estoppel should only be applied against the state where there is substantial proof and a compelling reason. Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-121 (Feb. 12, 2018) (citing Everett v. Jones, 277 Ark. 162, 639 S.W.2d 739 (1982)) (declining to apply estoppel to the state for not previously notifying the taxpayers that they should collect sales tax for the services they provide); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-237 (Feb. 28, 2018) (declining to apply estoppel where the taxpayer chose to not have the revenue office employees testify); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 18-211 (March 12, 2018) (declining to apply estoppel where the taxpayer had failed to receive written guidance).
