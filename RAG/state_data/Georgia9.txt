Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Taxation of Property

Taxable Georgia imposes a sales or use tax on the retail purchase, retail sale, rental, storage, use, or consumption of tangible personal property and certain enumerated services. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-30(a). Tangible personal property is defined as personal property that can be seen, weighed, measured, felt, or touched or that is in any other manner perceptible to the senses. Tangible personal property includes electricity, water, gas, steam, and prewritten computer software. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-2(37); Georgia Letter Ruling SUT-2016-14 (July 11, 2016) (a charge by a multi-level marketer to distributors for the right to sell products and receive discounts is not the sale of tangible personal property). BNA-SUTN GA 9.1.

Depends With exception of certain services, Georgia excludes the sale of services from its sales and use tax. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-30(f)(1); Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-2(31). BNA-SUTN GA 9.2.

Depends The definition of “sales price” includes any services that are part of the sale. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-2(34)(A). The definition, however, specifically exempts interest, financing, carrying charges, and installation charges, if they are separately stated on the invoice, billing, or similar document given to the purchaser. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-2(34)(B)(iii)–Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-2(34)(B)(iv). Furthermore, when a professional, insurance, or personal service transaction involves a sale of tangible personal property as an inconsequential element for which no separate charge is made, the transaction is exempt. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-3(22); Hawes v. Dimension Inc., 176 S.E.2d 602 (Ga. App. 1970) (holding that no tax applied to a service provider's transfer of architectural renderings); Georgia Letter Ruling SUT-2015-02-Service Provider-Educational Training (April 6, 2015) (ruling that the true object of taxpayer's customers is the purchase of nontaxable educational training services; taxpayer's provision of t-shirts and training materials to students for no separate charge is an inconsequential element of the service transaction). The test to determine whether tangible personal property is inconsequential is whether the customer is paying more for the professional skill or for the materials, labor and overhead used in fabrication. See Craig-Tourial Leather Co. v. Reynolds, 87 Ga. App. 360, 365(Ct. App. 1952)(in which the court states, ”we think the main consideration should be the purpose of the customer”); Georgia Letter Ruling SUT-2015-02-Service (April 6, 2015)(the test is whether customer is primarily interested in buying services rather than tangible personal property transferred in conjunction with performance of services).

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Bundled Transactions

Taxable Georgia imposes sales or use tax upon the total amount of consideration received by a vendor in connection with the sale of a bundled transaction. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-30(a). The term bundled transaction means the retail sale of two or more products, except real property and services to real property, where the products are otherwise distinct and identifiable, and the products are sold for one non-itemized price. A bundled transaction does not include the sale of any products in which the sales price varies, or is negotiable, based on the selection by the purchaser of the products included in the transaction. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-2(3). Distinct and identifiable products do not include packaging such as containers, boxes, sacks, bags, and bottles or other materials such as wrapping, labels, tags, and instruction guides that accompany the retail sale of the products and are incidental or immaterial to the retail sale. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-2(3)(A)(i). Packaging that is incidental or immaterial includes grocery sacks, shoeboxes, dry cleaning garment bags, and express delivery envelopes and boxes. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-2(3)(B)(i). A product provided free of charge with the required purchase of another product is also not a distinct and identifiable product. A product is provided free of charge if the sales price of the product purchased does not vary depending on the inclusion of the product provided free of charge. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-2(3)(B)(ii). The phrase “one non-itemized price”does not include a price that is separately identified by product on binding sales or other supporting sales-related documentation made available to the customer in paper or electronic form, including an invoice, bill of sale, receipt, contract, service agreement, lease agreement, periodic notice of rates and services, rate card, or price list. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-2(3)(C). Transactions Not Considered Bundled Transactions A transaction that otherwise meets the definition of a bundled transaction as defined in this section is not a bundled transaction if the transaction is described by any one of the following statements:• The retail sale of tangible personal property and a service where the tangible personal property is essential to the use of the service, and is provided exclusively in connection with the service, and the true object of the transaction is the service. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-2(3)(D)(i). • The retail sale of services where one service is provided that is essential to the use or receipt of a second service and the first service is provided exclusively in connection with the second service and the true object of the transaction is the second service. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-2(3)(D)(ii). • A transaction that includes taxable products and nontaxable products and the purchase price or sales price of the taxable products is de minimis. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-2(3)(D)(iii)(I). o De minimis means the seller's purchase price or sales price of the taxable products is 10 percent or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled products. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-2(3)(D)(iii)(I). o Sellers must use either the purchase price or the sales price of the products to determine if the taxable products are de minimis. Sellers may not use a combination of the purchase price and sales price of the products to determine if the taxable products are de minimis. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-2(3)(D)(iii)(II). o Sellers must use the full term of a service contract to determine if the taxable products are de minimis. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-2(3)(D)(iii)(II). • The retail sale of exempt tangible personal property and taxable tangible personal property where: Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-2(3)(D)(iv). o The transaction includes food and food ingredients, drugs, durable medical equipment, mobility-enhancing equipment, over-the-counter drugs, prosthetic devices, or medical supplies; and Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-2(3)(D)(iv)(I). o If the seller's purchase price or sales price of the taxable tangible personal property is 50 percent or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled tangible personal property. Sellers may not use a combination of the purchase price and sales price of the tangible personal property when making the fifty percent determination for a transaction. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-2(3)(D)(iv)(II). Bundled Telecommunications Charges If a telephone service is not subject to tax, and if the amount charged for such telephone service is aggregated with and not separately stated from the amount paid or charged for any service that is subject to such tax, then the nontaxable telephone service is treated as being subject to such tax unless the telephone service provider can reasonably identify the amount paid or charged for the telephone service not subject to such tax.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Local Jurisdictions, Taxability Distinctions

Differs from State The state exemption provided for food and food ingredients does not apply to most local sales and use tax imposed. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-3(57)(A). With certain exceptions, local sales and use taxes apply to the same base as the state sales and use tax. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-110.1(c); Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-4-.03(1); Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-5-.03(1); Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-7-.03(1); Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-7-.04(1)(a). The sale of food and food ingredients, while exempt from Georgia's state sales and use tax, is subject to local sales and use tax, with the exception of the local equalized homestead option sales tax which exempts food and food ingredients. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-3(57)(D)(i), as amended by 2017 Ga. S.B. 156, §1, effective May 8, 2017. Additionally, the exemption for state sales and use tax for energy purchased by a manufacturer that is primarily engaged in producing electricity for resale does not extend to local sales and use taxes. Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-2-.64(3)(b); Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-2-.64(4)(c). Georgia publishes the local sales and use tax rates that apply to sales of energy to manufacturers. Georgia Dept. of Rev., Georgia Sales and Use Tax Rates Energy Sold to Manufacturers (effective April 1, 2019). Also, unlike the other local sales and use taxes, the special district transportation sales and use tax does not apply to certain fuels. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-241(d). For more information on the special district transportation sales and use tax, see the Sales and Use Tax, Navigator, at Georgia 1.1.3. BNA-SUTN GA 9.4.
