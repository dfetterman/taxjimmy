Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Taxation of Services

Exempt Services in Virginia are generally not subject to tax. However, charges for certain services are expressly subject to tax. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-603(5). Taxable services include:• services included in or with a tangible personal property sale; Va. Regs. §10-210-4040(B)(1). See, e.g., Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 16-64 (April 22, 2016) (providing services in connection with sales of meals, prepared food, or catering does not change the character of the sales transactions, and the sales remain sales of tangible personal property rather than sales of a service). • services to fabricate tangible personal property, whether or not the customer furnishes (directly or indirectly) the fabrication materials; Va. Regs. §10-210-4040(B)(2); see also Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 11-9 (Jan. 21, 2011) (long-arm quilting constitutes fabrication); Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 11-77 (May 26, 2011) (cutting bricks used by masonry contractors constitutes fabrication). • services to furnish, prepare, or serve meals or other tangible personal property by a person for consideration; Va. Regs. §10-210-4040(B)(3). and • rooms, lodgings, or accommodations furnished to transients by any hotel, motel, inn, tourist camp or cabin, camping grounds, club, or any other similar place furnished for fewer than 90 continuous days. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-603; Va. Regs. §10-210-4040(B)(4); Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 15-114 (June 16, 2015) (parking charges associated with the sale of accommodations are deemed to be a part of the room charge and are subject to retail sales tax); Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 12-209 (Dec. 13, 2012) (no sales tax on campsites leased for seven months). Tax-exempt services include:• personal, professional, or insurance transactions that involve sales as inconsequential elements for which no separate charge is made; • separately stated services performed by repairmen; • separately stated labor or service charges for the repair, installation, application, or remodeling of tangible personal property; • separately stated transportation charges; • separately stated charges for alterations to apparel, clothing, and garments; • charges for gift wrapping services performed by a nonprofit organization; • separately stated charges for labor or services rendered to modify prewritten programs as defined in Va. Code Ann. §58.1-602; • computer programs that are “custom programs” as defined by Va. Code §58.1-602; Va. Regs. §10-210-4040(C). and • hotel charges for parking only (i.e., not associated with accommodations). Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 15-114 (June 16, 2015). Complications arise when a transaction consists of both a service and a transfer of tangible personal property. Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 04-166 (Oct. 2, 2004) (waste disposal provided solely as a service to customers is not subject to tax, but waste disposal fee is taxable if charged in connection with the sale of tangible personal property). Va. Code §58.1-609.5(1) provides an exemption for professional, insurance, or personal services as long as related sales of tangible personal property are “inconsequential elements” of the transaction. To satisfy this requirement, the sales of tangible personal property must not be separately stated, and the “true object” of the transaction must be to provide the service. Va. Code §58.1-609.5(1); Va. Regs. §10-210-4040. See Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 98-51 (March 12, 1998) (advertising agencies were improperly assessed sales and use tax on mailing services where printing services were performed on stock provided by customers and the true object of the transaction was the performance of exempt advertising services); Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 05-11 (Feb. 4, 2005) (fees charged in conjunction with prepaid credit card services are not subject to sales and use tax). Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 12-62 (April 30, 2012) (a taxpayer's nutritional consulting, business management, and food preparation services to healthcare and long term care facilities are exempt from sales tax as professional services); see also Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 12-63 (April 30, 2012) (taxpayers' monthly flat fees it pays to a management company for the operation of dietary departments in its continuing care retirement facilities for senior citizens are exempt from sales tax as professional services without the transfer of tangible personal property because the taxpayers never take possession of, or title to, the food). Transactions involving both the sale of tangible personal property and the furnishing of services generally are either taxable or exempt on the full amount charged, regardless whether separately stated. Va. Regs. §10-210-4040(A). BNA-SUTN VA 9.2.

True Object Test Complications arise when a transaction consists of both a service and a transfer of tangible personal property. Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 04-166 (Oct. 2, 2004) (waste disposal provided solely as a service to customers is not subject to tax, but waste disposal fee is taxable if charged in connection with the sale of tangible personal property). Virginia uses the “true object test” to determine whether a particular transaction that involves both the rendering of a service and the provision of tangible personal property constitutes an exempt service or a taxable retail sale. If the object of the transaction is to secure a service and the tangible personal property that is transferred to the customer is not critical to the transaction, then the transaction may constitute an exempt service. However, if the object of the transaction is to secure the property that it produces, then the entire charge, including the charge for any services provided, is taxable. Va. Regs. §10-210-4040(D). If both the services rendered and the property transferred are critical elements of a transaction, the degree of customization, uniqueness, or specific services provided in connection with the product must be considered in determining its appropriate tax status. Va. Regs. §10-210-4040(D). The following are examples of taxable transactions in which the tax status is based on the above factors, where the object of the taxable transaction is to obtain the tangible personal property provided by the seller because no special or customized services are involved in providing the tangible property, that subject the transactions to tax:• standard data lists or reports; Va. Regs. §10-210-4040(D)(1)(a). • extra copies of reports or letters; Va. Regs. §10-210-4040(D)(1)(b). • equipment rentals; Va. Regs. §10-210-4040(D)(1)(c); see also Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 16-72 (May 6, 2016) (concluding that a nonprofit organization engaged in a taxable transaction when it leased two copier/printer/scanner machines in a lease contract that also provided for staffing services). and • data communications equipment. Va. Regs. §10-210-4040(D)(1)(d). The following are examples of tax-exempt transactions in which the tax status is based on the above factors when the object of the exempt transactions is to obtain a service from the seller, which is why they are not subject to tax:• customized data lists, reports; Va. Regs. §10-210-4040(D)(2)(a). • original letters or reports; Va. Regs. §10-210-4040(D)(2)(b). • equipment rentals with operators; Va. Regs. §10-210-4040(D)(2)(c). • data communications services, including equipment. Va. Regs. §10-210-4040(D)(2)(d). The object of any transaction that includes the transmittal of information through electronic means(e.g., current stock market quotations via a terminal)is deemed to be a service because the object of the transaction is to obtain the service of electronic information transmittal and the tangible personal property included serves only as the medium for securing the service. However, the sale or lease of tangible personal property that transmits or receives electronic information not in connection with the provision of information services is taxable. Va. Regs. §10-210-4040(D). In a package transaction that involves an exempt admissions charge and taxable prepared food, the transaction is not taxed based on the true object of the transaction. Rather, when the package is sold for one non-itemized charge, the entire charge is subject to tax. The provision of food as a part of the package is the determining factor. Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 14-41 (March 20, 2014); Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 17-12 (March 3, 2017) (upholding assessment of sales tax on party packages including charges for laser tag games and other services together with food and beverages; charges for services billed in conjunction with provision of tangible personal property are subject to tax). BNA-SUTN VA 9.3.1.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Bundled Transactions

Taxable Virginia provides specific provisions for bundled transactions of communication services which consist of distinct and identifiable properties, services, or both, sold for one nonitemized charge for which the tax treatment of the distinct properties and services are different. Va. Code §58.1-650. If the charge is attributable to services that are taxable and services that are not taxable, the portion of the charge attributable to the nontaxable services will be subject to tax unless the communications service provider can reasonably identify the nontaxable portion from its books and records. Va. Code §58.1-650. BNA-SUTN VA 9.3.2.
