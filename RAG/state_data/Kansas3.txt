Topic: Utilities, Fuel, Mining and Natural Resource Extraction, Production, Sale Mining, Timber, Natural Resource Extraction Mining

Depends Kansas offers several sales and use tax exemptions that are relevant to the mining industry. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(n); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(m); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(kk); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(pp). The first three are general manufacturing exemptions that could apply in a mining context, and the fourth is a mining-specific exemption. Namely, Kansas exempts:• sales of tangible personal property that is consumed in production; Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(n). • sales of tangible personal property that becomes an ingredient or component part of tangible personal property or services produced, manufactured or compounded; Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(m). • sales of machinery and equipment used as an integral or essential part of an integrated production operation by a manufacturing or processing plant or facility; See Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(kk). This exemption also includes relevant installation, repair, and maintenance services to the machinery and equipment. It also includes sales of repair and replacement parts for the machinery and equipment. and • sales of drill bits and explosives actually utilized to explore for and produce oil or gas. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(pp). Also, Kansas regulations address the state's tax treatment of drilling materials and other property. The regulations explain that Kansas imposes sales and use tax on sales to contractors of drilling materials or other property incorporated into an oil, gas or water well. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-79(a). However, Kansas exempts the service of installing or applying tangible personal property in connection with original construction that is the first or initial construction of a new oil, gas, or water well. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-79(f). “Consumed in Production”Exemption Kansas exempts from sales and use tax purchases of tangible personal property that manufacturers consume to produce, manufacture, process, mine, drill, refine, or compound tangible personal property. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(n); Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-53(a). Kansas uses a three-part test to determine whether a manufacturer consumes property in the production process. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3602(dd); Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-53(a). For more information about that three-part test and the “consumed in production” exemption generally, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Kansas 27.1.4.4. Additionally, although businesses engaged in oil drilling are generally considered contractors, whose purchases do not qualify for the machinery and equipment exemption, Kansas extends the exemption to “items consumed” in drilling. Kan. Stat. Ann. § 79-3606(n). The exemption applies to items consumed “within one year,” which generally includes drilling muds and chemicals. See Kansas Private Letter Ruling P-2004-027(June 24, 2004) (diesel fuel used by a contract earth mover is exempt); Kansas Private Letter Ruling P-2005-026(Oct. 18, 2005) (equipment used in recycling operations is not “an integral or essential part of an integrated production operation”). “Ingredient or Component Part” Exemption Kansas exempts from sales and use tax a manufacturer's use of tangible personal property that becomes an ingredient or component of manufactured tangible personal property. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(m); Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-54(a). Kansas regulations use a four-part test to determine whether tangible personal property qualifies as an ingredient or component part of manufactured property. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-54(a). For more information about that four-part test and the “ingredient or component part” exemption generally, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Kansas 27.1.4.2. Machinery and Equipment Used as an “Integral or Essential Part” of an “Integrated Production Operation” Kansas exempts from sales and use tax all sales of machinery and equipment used in Kansas as part of an “integrated production operation” by a “manufacturing or processing plant or facility.” Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(kk)(1)(A). However, the exemption does not extend to all oil and gas operations. See, e.g., In re Edmiston Oil Company Inc., 2012 BL 12794, 269 P.3d 833, No. 104,950 (Kan. Ct. App. Jan. 13, 2012) (denying an exemption for machinery and equipment used to extract oil and gas from the ground because the equipment was not used as an integral part of an integrated production or processing operation). See also Kansas Information Guide:Oil and Gas Well Services Self-Audit Fact Sheet (identifying taxable and exempt purchases by and sales from oil and gas well services). Kansas defines the phrase “manufacturing or processing business” as a business that utilizes an integrated production operation to manufacture, process, fabricate, finish, or assemble items for wholesale and retail distribution as part of what is commonly regarded by the general public as an industrial manufacturing or processing operation or an agricultural commodity processing operation. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(kk)(2)(D). The statute provides many examples of operations that qualify or do not qualify as manufacturing. See Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(kk)(2)(D)(i)–(D)(iii). One such example explains that the manufacturing exemption extends to operations at an oil well, gas well, mine or other excavation site where the oil, gas, minerals, coal, clay, stone, sand or gravel that has been extracted from the earth is cleaned, separated, crushed, ground, milled, screened, washed, or otherwise treated or prepared before its transmission to a refinery or before any other wholesale or retail distribution. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(kk)(2)(D)(i). Similarly, Kansas defines the phrase “manufacturing or processing plant or facility” as a single, fixed location owned or controlled by a manufacturing or processing business that consists of one or more structures or buildings in a contiguous area where integrated production operations are conducted to manufacture or process tangible personal property to be ultimately sold at retail. The statute explains that this definition does not include any facility primarily (i.e., more than 50 percent) operated for the purpose of conveying or assisting in the conveyance of natural gas, electricity, oil or water. However, a business may operate one or more manufacturing or processing plants or facilities at different locations to manufacture or process a single product of tangible personal property to be ultimately sold at retail. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(kk)(2)(C). See also Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(kk)(2) (defining several terms relevant to the manufacturing exemption). In 2005, the Kansas Department of Revenue issued a Private Letter Ruling that addressed the defined phrase “manufacturing or processing plant or facility” (and Kansas' manufacturing exemption generally) with respect to natural gas producers. The taxpayer in that ruling was a licensed natural gas producer that also operated natural gas gathering systems. The taxpayer had asked how the manufacturing exemption applied to its machinery and equipment. Specifically, the taxpayer had asked whether Kansas' manufacturing exemption (i.e., Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(kk))exempted processing equipment in a natural gas compressor station located in a gathering system or other pipeline. The department responded in the negative, stating that the manufacturing exemption's scope was limited to production equipment located at a manufacturing or processing plant or facility. The department explained that Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(kk)(2)(C) expressly excludes “any facility primarily operated for the purpose of conveying or assisting in conveyance of natural gas, electricity, oil, or water.” The department explained further that Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(kk)(5)(C) expressly excludes “transportation, transmission and distribution equipment. . . including the means of conveyance of natural gas, electricity, or water.” That second restriction meant that the manufacturing exemption does not extend to power lines, pipelines, gathering systems, distribution systems, waterlines, gas lines, or any associated equipment(e.g., transformers, compressors, pumps, scrubbers, separators, strainers, condensers, contractors, or absorption towers). For both reasons, the department concluded that the taxpayer's compressor was not a processing plant or facility and therefore that none of the processing or transportation equipment located there qualified for the manufacturing exemption. Kansas Private Letter Ruling P-2005-025 (Oct. 12, 2005). See also Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(kk)(2)(C) (defining the phrase “manufacturing or processing plant or facility”); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(kk)(5)(C) (listing examples of machinery and equipment that do not qualify for the manufacturing exemption). The letter ruling also reviewed more generally Kansas' sales tax treatment of natural gas operations. It explained that Kansas imposes sales and use tax on sales of construction materials used to build, maintain, and repair pipelines, as well as machinery and equipment that is part of a pipeline or that is located at a pipeline compressor facility. Kansas Private Letter Ruling P-2005-025 (Oct. 12, 2005), citing Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of Am. v. Kansas Comn. of Rev. & Taxn., 183 P.2d 234 (Kan. 1947). It also explained that Kansas taxes labor services performed to install new pipelines and pipeline equipment, as well as the services of maintaining, repairing, servicing, and altering pipelines and pipeline equipment. Kansas Private Letter Ruling P-2005-025 (Oct. 12, 2005), citing Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3603(p); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3603(q). It also explained that Kansas's manufacturing exemption has “never extended to sales of pipeline materials or equipment, [n]or to services performed on pipeline or pipeline equipment,” but rather that the exemption “is intended to benefit businesses that build and operate what are ‘commonly regarded by the general public as an industrial manufacturing or processesing operation.'” Kansas Private Letter Ruling P-2005-025 (Oct. 12, 2005), citing Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(kk). The ruling stated that “Kansans understand that . . . pipelines are built and primarily operated”to transport gas and are “not operated as manufacturing or processing businesses.” Kansas Private Letter Ruling P-2005-025 (Oct. 12, 2005). Lastly, the ruling explained that “natural gas pipelines do not become [manufacturing operations]simply because they operate equipment that cleans and separates liquids from the natural gas stream” by pointing to extensive statutory guidance to the contrary. Kansas Private Letter Ruling P-2005-025 (Oct. 12, 2005), citing Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(kk)(2)(C) (a facility used to convey or assist in conveying natural gas does not qualify); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(kk)(5)(C) (machinery and equipment that provides natural gas' means of conveyance outside a plant or facility does not qualify); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(kk)(3)(I) (transportation equipment is exempt only if it is located at a manufacturing plant or facility). However, the department acknowledged that Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(kk)(2)(D)(i) exempts operations at a “gas well . . . where the . . . gas . . . that has been extracted from the earth is cleaned, separated . . . or otherwise treated or prepared before its transmission to a refinery.” Kansas Private Letter Ruling P-2005-025 (Oct. 12, 2005). See also Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(kk)(2)(C) (defining the phrase “manufacturing or processing plant or facility”); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(kk)(5)(C) (listing examples of machinery and equipment that do not qualify for the manufacturing exemption). For more information about the manufacturing machinery and equipment exemption in Kansas generally, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Kansas 27.1. Drill Bits and Explosives Kansas exempts from sales and use tax sales of drill bits and explosives actually utilized to explore for and produce oil or gas. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(pp). Drilling Materials Kansas imposes sales and use tax on sales of drilling materials or other property incorporated into an oil, gas, or water well to contractors, subcontractors, or repairmen for use by them in original construction projects. Kansas considers each contractor to be the final user or consumer of materials used by them in the construction projects. Kansas requires that a contractor, subcontractor, or repairman must not give—nor must retailers accept—a resale exemption certificate to purchase the materials without sales tax. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-79(a). Examples of original construction project include drilling, equipping, furnishing, repairing, servicing, altering, maintaining, enlarging or redrilling. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-79(a). Further, the regulations explain that each contractor, subcontractor, or repairman is responsible for paying sales tax on all materials and supplies that he or she purchases for in drilling, redrilling, altering, or repairing oil, gas, or water wells for others. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-79(b). Likewise, each contractor, subcontractor, or repairman is responsible for collecting sales tax on taxable services performed for others, including taxable services performed for other contractors. A contractor, subcontractor, or repairman may not purchase or sell services exempt from sales tax under a resale exemption certificate. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-79(c). The regulations explain how Kansas defines the tax base for all relevant contracts involving the application or installation of tangible personal property in these situations. The tax base is the difference between the contract price and the cost of material, supplies, and payments to subcontractors. This includes sales and use tax paid by the contractor on the materials, supplies, and subcontractor charges to complete the contract. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-79(d). The regulations also address situations in which the contractor, subcontractors, or repairman does not separately state the amount of sales tax for their services in the contract, bid estimate, or customer billing. In that situation, the regulations require a statement in the document in substantially the following form: “All applicable sales taxes are included in the selling price.” If that statement does not appear in the contract, bid estimate, billing, or other evidence of the transaction, then Kansas presumes that sales tax was not charged. Further, if a statement does not appear on the document, then the retailer carries the burden of proving that sales tax was charged to the consumer and properly remitted to Kansas. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-79(e). Lastly, the regulations explain that Kansas does not impose sales or use tax on the service of installing or applying tangible personal property in connection with original construction that is the first or initial construction of a new oil, gas or water well. In that context, Kansas defines the phrase “original construction“as all contractor-performed services through the well's completion date. Also, the regulations state that any other service performed in or on oil, gas, or water wells is subject to sales tax. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-79(f). BNA-SUTN KS 30.3.1.

Exempt Sales of machinery and equipment used as an integral or essential part of an integrated oil and gas operation are exempt. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(pp). Sales of machinery and equipment used as an integral or essential part of an integrated production operation by a manufacturing or processing plant, including those engaged in oil and gas production, are exempt from sales and use tax. Also, Kansas regulations address the state's tax treatment of drilling materials and other property. The regulations explain that Kansas imposes sales and use tax on sales to contractors of drilling materials or other property incorporated into an oil, gas or water well. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-79(a). However, Kansas exempts the service of installing or applying tangible personal property in connection with original construction that is the first or initial construction of a new oil, gas, or water well. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-79(f). Kansas exempts from sales and use tax all sales of machinery and equipment used in Kansas as part of an “integrated production operation” by a “manufacturing or processing plant or facility.” Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(kk)(1)(A). However, the exemption does not extend to all oil and gas operations. See, e.g., In re Edmiston Oil Company Inc., 2012 BL 12794, 269 P.3d 833, No. 104,950 (Kan. Ct. App. Jan. 13, 2012) (denying an exemption for machinery and equipment used to extract oil and gas from the ground because the equipment was not used as an integral part of an integrated production or processing operation). See also Kansas Information Guide:Oil and Gas Well Services Self-Audit Fact Sheet (identifying taxable and exempt purchases by and sales from oil and gas well services). The manufacturing exemption extends to operations at an oil well, gas well, where the oil and gas, that has been extracted from the earth is cleaned, separated, screened, washed, or otherwise treated or prepared before its transmission to a refinery or before any other wholesale or retail distribution. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(kk)(2)(D)(i). Kansas imposes sales and use tax on sales of construction materials used to build, maintain, and repair pipelines, as well as machinery and equipment that is part of a pipeline or that is located at a pipeline compressor facility. Kansas Private Letter Ruling P-2005-025 (Oct. 12, 2005), citing Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of Am. v. Kansas Comn. of Rev. & Taxn., 183 P.2d 234 (Kan. 1947). Kansas's manufacturing exemption has “never extended to sales of pipeline materials or equipment, [n]or to services performed on pipeline or pipeline equipment,” but rather that the exemption “is intended to benefit businesses that build and operate what are ‘commonly regarded by the general public as an industrial manufacturing or processsing operation.'” Kansas Private Letter Ruling P-2005-025 (Oct. 12, 2005), citing Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(kk). The ruling stated that “Kansans understand that . . . pipelines are built and primarily operated”to transport gas and are “not operated as manufacturing or processing businesses.” Kansas Private Letter Ruling P-2005-025 (Oct. 12, 2005). Lastly, the ruling explained that “natural gas pipelines do not become [manufacturing operations]simply because they operate equipment that cleans and separates liquids from the natural gas stream” by pointing to extensive statutory guidance to the contrary. Kansas Private Letter Ruling P-2005-025 (Oct. 12, 2005), citing Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(kk)(2)(C) (a facility used to convey or assist in conveying natural gas does not qualify); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(kk)(5)(C) (machinery and equipment that provides natural gas a means of conveyance outside a plant or facility does not qualify); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606(kk)(3)(I) (transportation equipment is exempt only if it is located at a manufacturing plant or facility). BNA-SUTN KS 30.3.2.1.
