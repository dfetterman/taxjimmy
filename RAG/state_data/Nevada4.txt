Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §360.753, as amended by 2017 Nev. S.B. 442, effective July 1, 2017. Prior to June 8, 2015, Nevada exempted from state sales and use tax sales of aircraft and major components to an air carrier certified under federal law that maintained its central office in Nevada and based a majority of its aircraft in Nevada. The requirement that the air carrier maintain its central office in Nevada was declared unconstitutional by the Nevada Supreme Court in Worldcorp v. Nevada Dept. of Taxn. The court concluded that Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.317 “must be stricken from our statutory scheme because it runs afoul of the Commerce Clause.” In 1995, the Nevada legislature passed Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.726, which provided that any requirement of the aircraft exemption held unconstitutional should not be enforced by the Department of Taxation. See Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.317, §12, as repealed by 2015 Nev. A.B. 161, §12, effective June 8, 2015; Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.726, §12, as repealed by 2015 Nev. A.B. 161, §12, effective June 8, 2015.
