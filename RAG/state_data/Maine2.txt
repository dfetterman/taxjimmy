Topic: Administration and Procedure Vendor/Seller Registration

Required Editors' Note: For analysis of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. and its impact on state tax nexus standards, see Wayfair Watch. Persons making sales of tangible personal property or taxable services, which are not casual sales, are required to register with the State Tax Assessor if such persons have some form of physical presence or substantial nexus with in the State. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1754-B(1);Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §2553(1); Maine Reference Guide to the Sales and Use Tax Law (October 2018). Planning Point: On June 21, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. which involved a South Dakota statute establishing nexus for remote retailers. The Court concluded that, under the Commerce Clause, a retailer must have substantial nexus with a state in order for the state to impose sales tax collection requirements on the retailer. Substantial nexus does not require physical presence. South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., No. 17-494, 2018 BL 219995 (U.S. June 21, 2018) (citing Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U.S. 274 (1977)). The following persons are required to register with the State Tax Assessor if they are not casual sellers:• every seller of tangible personal property or taxable services that maintains an office, manufacturing facility, distribution facility, warehouse, storage facility, sales or sample room, or other place of business in the state of Maine; • every seller of tangible personal property or taxable services that does not maintain a place of business, but makes retail sales in Maine or solicits orders through the use of one or more salespersons within the state; • every lessor engaged in leasing tangible personal property located in Maine; • every person that makes retail sales in Maine on behalf of a principal, if the principal is not the holder of a valid registration certificate; • every agent, representative, salesperson, solicitor, or distributor that receives compensation by reason of sales of tangible personal property or taxable services made outside Maine by a principal for use, storage, or other consumption within the state; • every person that manages or operates a hotel, rooming house, or tourist or trailer camp in Maine; • every seller of tangible personal property or services with substantial physical presence; however, the following do not establish substantial physical presence: ○ solicitation of business in Maine with catalogs, flyers, or electronic media when delivery of goods is accomplished through the U.S. mail or a third-party common carrier; ○ attending trade shows, seminars, or conventions in Maine; ○ holding a corporate or company meeting in Maine; ○ maintaining a bank account or banking relationship in Maine; or ○ using a Maine vendor for printing, drop shipping, or telemarketing services. • every person that makes retail sales in Maine of tangible personal property or taxable services on behalf of the owner of that property or the provider of those services; • every person not otherwise required to be registered that sells tangible personal property to the state and is required to register as a condition of doing business with the state; and • every person that holds a wine direct shipper license. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1754-B(1); Maine Business Guide to Sales, Use, and Service Provider Tax (revised Nov. 1, 2017). For sales occurring on or after Oct. 1, 2018, every person engaged in the facilitation of the rental of living quarters by means of operating a transient rental platform and every room remarketer are required to register with the State Tax Assessor. Additionally, any person that collects or receives rents on behalf of a hotel, rooming house or tourist or trailer camp in Maine is required to register. Me. Rev. Stat.

S.P. 676, effective July 17, 2018; Maine Reference Guide to Sales and Use Tax Law (October 2018);Maine Revenue Services, Enacted Tax Legislation - 2018 Session. Remote Sellers Beginning Nov. 1, 2017, persons who sell tangible personal property, products transferred electronically, or services for delivery into Maine must collect and remit the sales tax in the same manner as retailers with a physical presence in the state if:• the seller earned gross revenue exceeding $100,000 from the sale and delivery of taxable tangible personal property, products transferred electronically, and services into Maine in either the current or previous calendar year;or • the seller completed at least 200 separate transactions through which it sold taxable tangible personal property, products transferred electronically, or services that were delivered into Maine in either the current or previous calendar year. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1951-B(3); see Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 43; Maine Business Guide to Sales, Use, and Service Provider Tax (revised Nov. 1, 2017); Maine Reference Guide to the Sales and Use Tax Law (October 2018). Tax Payment Requirement A person attempting to register tangible personal property for use within the state must pay the sales and use tax in order to register, or prove that the tax is not due. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1755. Voluntary Registration Any person not required to register with the State Tax Assessor may elect to do so. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1757. Upon voluntary registration, a person has the same rights and duties as a person who is a required registrant and is subject to the same penalties. However, a voluntary registrant may elect to cancel the registration at any time. The State Tax Assessor will cancel a voluntary registration upon receipt of such a request. Once a seller's certificate of registration has been cancelled, the seller must cease to collect any Maine sales and use tax. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1757. Registration Certificates A registration certificate will be granted for each properly completed application. Registration certificates are nontransferable and a separate registration certificate is required for each place of business.

Registered retailers must inform the State Tax Assessor in writing of any changes to the type or types of items intended to be purchased for resale. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1754-B(2). In Maine, a retailer's registration certificated must be conspicuously displayed at the place of business. If the taxpayer does not have a fixed place of business, an automobile that is used for business purposes is considered a place of business where a registration certificate may be affixed. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1754-B(2). Provisional Resale Certificates Applicants that state an expected annual gross sale of $3,000 or more on their registration application will receive a retail certificate upon initial registration. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1754-B(2-B), as amended by 2019 Me. H.P. 1279, effective Sept. 19, 2019. Provisional certificates that are granted between January 1st and September 30th are effective for the remainder of the calendar year in which they are granted as well as for the following three years. Certificates that are granted between October 1st and December 31st are effective until the close of the fourth subsequent calendar year following granting of the certificate. Provisional certificates must contain the:• name of the retailer; • address of the retailer; • certificate expiration date; and • certificate number. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1754-B(2-B), as amended by 2019 Me. H.P. 1279, effective Sept. 19, 2019 (extending the duration from two to three years). Issuance and Renewal of Resale Certificates Except for resale certificates expiring after December 31st, the assessor must review the returns filed by every registered retailer on November 1st of each year. If the retailer reports gross sales of $3,000 or more for the previous 12 months, the assessor must issue the retailer a resale certificate that is effective for five years. If the gross sales of the retailer are under $3,000 for the previous 12 months, the retailer must petition for the renewal of the resale certificate. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1754-B(2-C), as amended by 2013 Me. S.P. 333, enacted June 21, 2013. Revocation of Registration A registration certificate may be revoked if a registrant fails to file a required bond or deposit, or for cause within 15 days after receipt of notice. When a registration certificate is revoked the revocation is reviewable. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1757. Effective August 1, 2018, the statute allowing the State Tax Assessor to require a bond for a retailer as a condition for issuance of a registration certificate or subsequent to the issuance of a registration certificate is amended to apply to all registered retailers. Maine General Information Bulletin No. 108. Failure to Register Failure to register in a situation where registration is required is a Class E crime that is subject to a strict liability standard. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1754-B(3). BNA-SUTN ME 31.2.

Taxpayers required to file electronically will be notified by Maine Revenue Services. Code Me. R. §18-125-102.02. See Maine Reference Guide to the Sales and Use Tax Law (October 2018). Taxpayers may make a request in writing to Maine Revenue Services for a waiver of mandatory EFT participation with a showing of good cause. Code Me. R. §18-125-102.06. Any of the following circumstances will generally be considered to constitute good cause:• The taxpayer's bank does not participate in ACH in any form. The taxpayer must provide a letter from its financial institution. • The taxpayer's current tax liability and reporting trend shows a decline in the amount of reported tax liability. If projected into the future, the tax liability will not meet or exceed the applicable mandatory threshold amount. • The taxpayer's tax liability meets or exceeds the applicable mandatory threshold amount only because of uncharacteristically high tax amounts reported in 3 or fewer months of the look-back period. However, good cause does not exist under this paragraph in the case of a person reporting withholding tax on a quarterly basis. • The taxpayer is under the payroll administration of the federal government. Code Me. R. §18-125-102.06. Payments made by EFT are due the same date as if the taxpayer did not use EFT; however, taxpayers using ACH credit or debit method must initiate payments at least one business day before the payment due date.

If the State Tax Assessor denies the application, the applicant is entitled to a petition for reconsideration. Code Me. R. §18-125-302.02; Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 36. Certificate-holders must present the certificate to sellers when making purchases. Exemption certificates contain a permit number, the entity's name, and the entity's address. An entity may use the certificate only for activities specifically identified by the particular exemption granted. Without presentation of an exemption certificate, sales that would otherwise qualify for an exemption will be deemed taxable. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1760-C; Code Me. R. §18-125-302.02; Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 36.

Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1760-C; Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 36. The seller bears the burden of proving that a sale is to an exempt organization. Code Me. R. §18-125-302.02(1). A retailer must maintain a copy of the exemption certificate issued to any exempt organization to which it made a tax-exempt sale. Code Me. R. §18-125-302.02(3). Separate invoices of all tax-exempt sales must be retained by the retailer.

Ann. tit. 36, §1754-B(2-B),(2-C); Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 1; Maine Instructional Bulletin No.54; Maine Reference Guide to the Sales and Use Tax Law (October 2018). The certificate will enable the retailer to purchase tangible personal property for resale without payment of sales tax. Only one certificate need be furnished to each supplier to cover subsequent purchases by that retailer. On subsequent purchases, the retailer must inform the supplier whether or not the purchase is covered by the resale certificate on file and will be held responsible for the tax on any item purchased for resale but subsequently used by the retailer. Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 1 A “Resale Certificate” will only be issued by Maine Revenue Services on initial application if the applicant meets the qualifications to receive one. Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 54 Issuance of a Provisional Resale Certificate When a retailer first applies for a sales tax registration, the retailer will be issued a provisional resale certificate provided the applicant expects to receive $3,000 or more in gross sales proceeds over the next year. This certificate is valid from the date of issuance to December 31st of the third year from the date of issuance. If the certificate is issued between October 1st and December 31st, the certificate will be valid until December 31st of the fourth year from the date of issuance. Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 54 Renewal of Resale Certificate Maine Revenue Services conducts an annual review of all active registered retailers to determine whether they qualify to receive a renewal of their “Resale Certificate” for the next period. “Resale Certificates” are automatically renewed to retailers that have reported $3,000 or more in gross sales during the previous 12 months. Retailers that do not meet the $3,000 threshold may make a written request for an earlier review of their account and renewal of a resale certificate in the following situations:1. The retailer has reported gross sales exceeding $3,000 during a more recent 12 month period, or 2.

Manufacturers and utilities that routinely procure large amounts of tangible personal property under conditions that make it difficult to conclude the manner in which the property will be used may obtain direct pay permits since it is impractical to determine the taxability of the property at the time of sale. Code Me. R. §18-125-308.01; Maine Revenue Services Amendment to Rule Concerning Direct Pay Permits (Nov. 3, 2016). In order to receive a direct pay permit, a taxpayer must:• be a utility or manufacturer; • file a permit application with the Bureau of Revenue Service; • hold a valid Maine Retailer Certificate; • routinely purchase large amounts of tangible personal property that make it impractical to conclude, at the time of sale, the taxability of the property; • establish that its accounting methods clearly reflects the proper tax due to the satisfaction of the State Tax Assessor; • establish that direct reporting of sales and use tax will not jeopardize the payment of the sales and use tax; and • purchase enough tangible personal property to justify the expense of regular audits by the state. Code Me. R. §18-125-308.02; Maine Revenue Services Amendment to Rule Concerning Direct Pay Permits (Nov. 3, 2016). Each direct pay permit holder must file a copy of the permit with each of its vendors, and affix the direct pay permit number on all purchase orders and contracts for the purchase of tangible personal property.

R. §18-125-308.04. Holders of direct pay permits may not authorize lessors or contractors to use their direct pay permits to:• purchase tangible personal property tax-free for incorporation into real estate before the passage of title. Title does not pass before incorporation into the real estate unless a construction contract specifically states that title does pass prior; or • enter into a lease for tangible personal property with a holder of a direct pay permit if it would infer that the tangible personal property purchased by the lessor for lease to the permit holder may be purchased tax-free under a direct pay permit. Code Me. R. §18-125-308.04. Revocation Direct pay permit holders must obtain written permission from the State Tax Assessor in order to voluntarily surrender the permit. Code Me. R. §18-125-308.05. Failure to comply with the conditions of the permit or misuse of direct pay permit authority may lead to revocation of the direct pay permit by the State Tax Assessor. Code Me. R. §18-125-308.05.

Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §141(1). See Maine Reference Guide to the Sales and Use Tax Law (October 2018). The State Tax Assessor may make an assessment within six years from the actual filing date shown on the return if the tax liability on the return after necessary adjustments is less than 50 percent of the tax liability. The State Tax Assessor may not consider understated tax liability for which the taxpayer has substantial supporting authority in determining the 50 percent threshold. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §141(2). An assessment may be made by the State Tax Assessor at any time if a fraudulent return was filed. Additionally, as long as a past due return remains unfiled, an assessment can be made anytime. The State Tax Assessor may assess an estimated tax liability based on information available if the taxpayer refuses to produce information subsequent to receiving a 30-day notice by the assessor. The State Tax Assessor's estimate constitutes prime facie evidence of the tax liability. The 30-day period after may be increased to 90 days if the taxpayer files a written request. The time for assessment may be extended to any later date that the State Tax Assessor and liable taxpayer agree to. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §141(2). Sales, use, and service provider taxes declared in a return and filed with the State Tax Assessor are due and payable on or before the prescribed filing due date without reference to any granted extensions.

Upon entering into a voluntary disclosure agreement with a state, taxpayers will be required to file returns, pay the tax due and accrued interest on the returns, and register with the state in exchange for waiver of penalties for the entire look-back period. Taxpayers are not charged to participate in the MVDP. BNA-SUTN ME 31.15.3.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Audits

Authorized The state tax assessor has the power to conduct audits whenever necessary. The assessor may examine the place of business, books and other documents, and any other relevant personal property of any person who the assessor has reason to believe is liable for sales and use tax. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §112(4); Maine Reference Guide to the Sales and Use Tax Law (October 2018). Audits have a general look-back period of three years. However certain situations would extend the look-back period, as follows:• If the tax liability shown on the return is less than half of the tax liability determined by the assessor, the look-back period is six years. • If a fraudulent return is filed, an audit or assessment can be made at any time. • If a return for a certain tax period was required but not filed, an audit or assessment can be made at any time. • A look-back period may be extended past three years to a date agreed upon, in writing, by the assessor and the taxpayer. • If the assessor determines that taxes declared are in jeopardy, any tax due may be collected immediately. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §141; Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §145; Maine Reference Guide to the Sales and Use Tax Law (October 2018). The assessor may summon and examine under oath any person whose testimony is considered necessary. In addition, the assessor may require the production of all books or other documents in control of the person summoned in order to conduct an accurate investigation and make a tax assessment. Any justice of the Superior Court or probate judge, upon application of the assessor, may compel the attendance of witnesses and the giving of testimony before the assessor in the same manner, to the same extent, and subject to the same penalties as if before the court over which that justice or judge presides. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §112(3). BNA-SUTN ME 31.16.
