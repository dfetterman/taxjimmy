Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §526.11; see In re Henrie, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 825871 (July 14, 2016); In re Boissiere, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision Nos. 824467, 824937, and 824938 (July 28, 2015) (upholding per se liability of members for limited liability company's unpaid sales and use taxes). Sales tax must be collected at the point of sale based on the selling price. If a discount or rebate is applied to the purchase subsequent to the sale, the sales tax must still be collected based on the original selling price. In re Apple Inc. New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 827287 (Nov. 1, 2018) )(holding that Apple Inc. did not properly collect and remit sales tax because it computed the sales tax on the price of the qualifying device less a discount equal to the value of the gift card received by the customer instead of the entire price paid by the customer;the gift card issued by Apple Inc. was not a discount); Matter of Prima Asphalt Concrete, Inc. v New York Tax Appeals Tribunal, 2018 NY Slip Op 04411, 2018 BL 210833 (N.Y.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Purchaser Liability

Yes If a purchaser fails to pay a tax to the person required to collect the tax, then the purchaser must pay the tax directly to the Department of Taxation and Finance. N.Y. Tax Law §1133(b). BNA-SUTN NY 31.3.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Business Owners, Operators

Yes A person can be held liable for a corporation's unpaid taxes if that person had sufficient authority and control over the affairs of the corporation to be considered a responsible officer or employee. See, e.g., In re Constantino, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 802335 (Sept. 27, 1990). Further, if multiple individuals are found to have sufficient authority and control over the affairs of the corporation to be considered a responsible officer or employee, those individuals are jointly and severally liable for the unpaid taxes, including penalties and interest. The state has no responsibility to pursue all responsible officers or employees for the unpaid tax in order to pursue one. N.Y. Tax Law §1133(a); see In re Bitton, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 827185 (Feb. 8, 2018); see also In re Reuben, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 827340 (Feb. 15, 2018). A person is under a duty to collect and remit sales tax if he or she is authorized to sign a corporation's tax returns, is responsible for maintaining the corporate books, or is responsible for the corporation's management. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §526.11(b)(2); In re Pappas, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision Nos. 822124 and 822125 (Dec. 11, 2005), aff'g in part New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination Nos. 822124 and 822125 (Aug. 21, 2014) (finding that an investor who was not involved in a donut franchise's day-to-day operations was a responsible party because he signed the franchise agreement, was listed as the LLC's president, had signature authority over the bank accounts, and had the authority to sign checks or tax returns; but investor was not a responsible party for the entire period at issue because he had been “locked out” of the business); In re Tak Wing Tam, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination Nos. 817213 and 817214 (July 26, 2001), citing In re Constantino, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 802335 (Sept. 27, 1990); see also In re Marchello, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 821443 (April 14, 2011). Merely holding corporate office does not, per se, impose tax liability on a person. Rather, New York determines whether the person must collect and remit tax on a case-by-case basis. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §526.11(b)(2); see In re Bitton, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 827185 (Feb. 8, 2018). The pivotal question is whether the individual has or could have sufficient authority and control over the corporation's affairs. See In re Sidote, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 825772 (Aug. 13, 2015), citing Ianniello v. New York Tax Appeals Trib., 209 A.D.2d 740, 617 N.Y.S.2d 973 (N.Y. App. Div. Nov. 3, 1994); see also In re Hopwood, Jr., New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision Nos. 825756 and 825757 (Feb. 9, 2017) (finding petitioner as the person responsible to collect and pay the sales and use tax based his duties within the corporation during tax years at issue). In determining whether an individual has sufficient authority and control over the corporation's affairs, the following criteria are considered:• the individual's status as an officer, director, or shareholder; • whether the individual has authority to write checks on behalf of the corporation; • the individual's knowledge of and control over the financial affairs of the corporation; • whether the individual has authorization to hire and fire employees; • whether the individual signed tax returns for the corporation; and • the individual's economic interest in the corporation. In re Bitton, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 827185 (Feb. 8, 2018) (quoting In re Constantino, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 802335 (Sept. 27, 1990)). A person cannot absolve him or herself of liability for sales tax by delegating the responsibility to another responsible person or to an employee. Responsible persons must act with reasonable care and attention in confirming that delegated duties have been carried out. In re Reuben, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 827340 (Feb. 15, 2018) (owner of business did not act with reasonable care in entirely delegating all financial matters to an employee). If a person claims that he or she is not a “person required to collect tax,” then that person bears the burden of proof. The person must support this claim using clear and convincing evidence. In re Sacher, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 824107 (Jan. 16, 2014). Liability of LLC or Partnership's Members Unlike in the case of a corporate officer, New York imposes per se liability for unpaid sales tax on a limited liability company or partnership's members. In In re Santo, the New York Tax Appeals Tribunal ruled that a member of a restaurant LLC who was in charge of running the day-to-day operations was personally liable for the entity's unpaid sales tax debts. The tribunal found that the member was personally liable for the entity's unpaid sales taxes even though he held a minority interest and delegated responsibility for filing tax returns to another member. At the initial hearing, the ALJ ruled that the member was not personally liable for the sales tax debt because he was a minority investor who lacked the power to exercise tax collection responsibilities on behalf of the LLC. Reversing the ALJ's determination, the tribunal found that as an LLC member he was strictly liable for the LLC's tax debt, and it was an error to treat him as if he were an officer or employee of a corporation. In re Santo, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 821797 (Dec. 23, 2009); see also In re Reuben, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 827340 (Feb. 15, 2018) (imposing per se liability for unpaid sales tax on member of LLC). Effective April 12, 2018, New York provides relief from responsible persons liability for certain minority members of a limited liability company (LLC) and limited partners of a limited partnership. An LLC member or limited partner must submit an application for this relief to the Commissioner and meet specific requirements to be eligible for this relief. N.Y. Tax Law §1131(1), as amended by 2017 N.Y. S.B. 7509, Part X, effective April 12, 2018; New York TSB-M-18(1)S (May 25, 2018). Specifically if a partner of a limited liability partnership or a member of a limited liability company demonstrates to the satisfaction of the commissioner that such limited partner's or member's ownership interest and the percentage of the distributive share of the profits and losses of such limited partnership or limited liability company are each less than fifty percent, and such limited partner or member was not under a duty to act for such limited partnership or limited liability company in complying with any tax requirements, they may be relieved from liability. N.Y. Tax Law §1131(1), as amended by 2017 N.Y. S.B. 7509, Part X, effective April 12, 2018; New York TSB-M-18(1)S (May 25, 2018). Prior to April 12, 2018, the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance has issued guidance stating that certain members of limited liability companies and certain limited partners in partnerships may not be responsible persons. New York TSB-M-11(17)S (Sept. 19, 2011) Sale or Transfer of a Business or Business Assets Purchasers in a sale or transfer of a business or business assets must notify the department of the transfer at least 10 days before taking possession or making payment for the assets. N.Y. Tax Law §1141(c). Purchasers must also withhold funds from the seller for payment of sales and use taxes due. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, § 537.4. The notification must be sent to the department via registered mail and must include:• the assets included in the proposed sale; • the proposed price; • whether or not the seller as represented to the buyer that taxes are owed on the assets; • whether or not the buyer has any knowledge that taxes are owed on the assets; and • whether any taxes are in fact owed on the assets. N.Y. Tax Law §1141(c). If the purchaser fails to notify the department and fails to withhold taxes due, the purchaser becomes personally liable for all unpaid taxes. N.Y. Tax Law §1141(c); Mission Cantina v. Pan Asian Bistro Les, Inc., No. 653581, 2016 BL 273539 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Aug. 17, 2016); see In re Kayumi, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 825953 (July 14, 2017), aff'g New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 825953 (April 21, 2016)(taxpayer did not withhold the amount of tax due from the seller, despite being reminded by the department that he had an obligation to do so; thus, he became personally liable for the payment).

A certificate or other document is accepted in good faith when a vendor has no knowledge that the exemption certificate issued by the purchaser is false or fraudulently presented. If reasonable ordinary due care is exercised, knowledge will not be imputed to the seller required to collect the tax. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &Regs. tit. 20, §532.4(b)(2)(ii). See New York TSB-A-16(28)S (advising that vendor who timely, and in good faith, accepts a properly completed exemption certificate from a customer does not have a duty to investigate the customer's representations on the certificate). But see New York TSB-A-18(2)S (June 5, 2018) (vendor could not have accepted in good faith an exemption certificate for the rental of a truck for a construction project;the exemption is only for items which become a component part of a building, structure, or real property).

Tax Law §1147(b); see In re Garitta, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 827065 (Feb. 4, 2016), aff'd, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 827065 (Feb. 21, 2017) (taxpayer's raising a statute of limitations defense must demonstrate that notices of deficiency are not received or mailed during the three-year period;the notices in this case were sent during the three-year period, even though they were sent to an old address because the address was the address of record; therefore, the assessments were upheld). Once a notice of deficiency is mailed, the statute of limitations is suspended with respect to the amount of additional tax asserted in the notice until the expiration of the time for filing a petition contesting the notice. If a petition with respect to the amount asserted in the notice of deficiency is timely filed with the Division of Tax Appeals, the statute of limitations is suspended until the determination of the administrative law judge or the decision of the Tax Appeals Tribunal has become final. N.Y. Tax Law §1147(d). Where a taxpayer has signed and consented to an extension of the statute of limitations, failure to affix the New York Division of Taxation's seal to the executed consent does not render the extension invalid.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Civil Penalties

Yes Any person who fails to file a return, pay, or pay over any tax to the department within the time required is subject to a penalty of 10 percent of the amount of tax due, if such failure is for not more than one month. N.Y. Tax Law §1145(a)(1). There is an additional 1-percent penalty for each additional month or fraction thereof during which the failure to file or pay continues. The additional percentage will not exceed 30 percent in the aggregate. N.Y. Tax Law §1145(a)(1). The penalty imposed for the failure to file a return within 60 days of the filing deadline is the lesser of $100 or 100 percent of the amount required to be shown as tax on the return. N.Y. Tax Law §1145(a)(1)(i). The amount of tax required to be shown on the return is reduced by the amount of tax paid on or before the date prescribed for payment, and by the amount of any credit against the tax. The penalty for the failure to file a return by a person required to register with the department is not less than $50. N.Y. Tax Law §1145(a)(1)(i). A person who omits from his return an amount in excess of 25 percent of the amount of such taxes required to be shown on the return is subject to a penalty of 10 percent of the amount of such omission. N.Y. Tax Law §1145(a)(1)(vi). The amount of the omission is reduced by the portion of the omission which is attributable to the tax treatment of any item where there is substantial authority for such treatment, or for any item in which relevant facts affecting the item's tax treatment are adequately disclosed in the return. N.Y. Tax Law §1145(a)(1)(vi). If the department determines that the omission was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, it will remit all of the penalty. N.Y. Tax §1145(a)(1)(vi); In re Crown Sec., LLC, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision Nos. 824873 and 824957 (July 2, 2015), aff'g New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination Nos. 824873 and 824957 (May 1, 2014). If a failure to pay or pay over any tax to the department is due to fraud, in lieu of penalties and interest there is added to the tax a penalty of two times the amount of tax due plus interest at the rate of 14.5 percent per year or the underpayment rate, whichever is higher. N.Y. Tax §1145(a)(2); In re Express Fleet Service, Inc., New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 828056 (Feb. 14, 2019). Whenever a customer fails to pay any tax, penalty, or interest, the Attorney General may bring an action, upon request by the commissioner, to enforce the payment on behalf of New York in a New York court, any other state court, or a U.S. federal court. N.Y. Tax Law §1141(a). When past due tax liabilities equal or exceed$10,000, the department may suspend the driver's licenses of individual(s)liable for the debt. Certain exceptions from the program are available. N.Y. Tax Law §171-v; see In re Stanilewicz, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination Nos. 827121 and 827122 (Feb. 11, 2016) (a pending offer in compromise will not forestall a 60-day notice to suspend a license; only statutorily enumerated exceptions will disqualify taxpayers from the program; In re Faupel, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 826255 (Dec. 23, 2015) (taxpayer was properly notified that his license would be suspended and didn't qualify for an exception). When there is a dispute about whether there are past due tax liabilities, a taxpayer is not eligible for the license suspension program. In re Munjal, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 827123 (Jan. 14, 2016) (the department did not provide sufficient evidence demonstrating that the assessment at issue was for past due liabilities, so taxpayer's driver's license could not be suspended under N.Y. Tax Law §171-v); In re Khan, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 827003 (Sept. 15, 2016)(the taxpayer did not provide sufficient evidence demonstrating relief from the notice of proposed driver license suspension referral for past due tax assessments, so taxpayer's driver's license was suspended under N.Y. Tax Law §171-v); In re Borukhov, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 827358 (Dec. 15, 2016) (New York's Division of Tax Appeals sustained the Division of Taxation's notice to suspend a license as a result of taxpayer's failure to respond to the Divisions Motion for Summary Judgment); In re Demartino, No. 826652,(N.Y. Tax App. Trib. Dec. 16, 2016). (Division of Taxation's notice to suspend license sustained). BNA-SUTN NY 31.12.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Criminal Penalties

Yes If a taxpayer fails to make, render, sign, certify, or file any return or report, criminal penalties may be imposed. N.Y. Tax Law §1801(a)(1); New York TB-ST-805. If a taxpayer willfully fails to remit the state and local taxes collected, criminal penalties may also be imposed. N.Y. Tax Law §1801(a)(5); New York TB-ST-805. A taxpayer who is convicted or pleads guilty to fraudulently reporting or remitting sales tax may also have civil penalties imposed, and would be collaterally estopped from challenging the intent requirements of the civil fraud penalty. In re Express Fleet Service, Inc., New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 828056 (Feb. 14, 2019). BNA-SUTN NY 31.12.2.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Waiver of Penalties

Yes New York may waive penalties and interest imposed due to reasonable cause in certain circumstances. N.Y. Tax Law §1145. However, abatements will not be granted when the taxpayer cannot show reasonable cause for the failure to remit tax. Because the taxpayer bears the burden of proving reasonable cause, a business that was not registered with the state for sales tax purposes, did not file sales tax returns, and did not maintain adequate records as required by law, was denied a penalty abatement by the Division of Tax Appeals. In re Capital One Constr., Inc., New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision Nos. 825142 and 825208 (Feb. 16, 2016). But see In re Flair Beverages Corp., New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 826110 (Sept. 29, 2016)(maximum penalty imposed on alcoholic beverage wholesaler for failing to file required annual information returns in five consecutive periods was reduced to the minimum penalty allowed because taxpayer put forth substantial effort to determine whether it could comply with the filing requirement given its existing manual system, ultimately determining that the cost was too great).

Set Quarterly If any amount of tax is not paid on or before the last date that payment is required, interest is charged on the unpaid amount at the rate specified by statute, currently, 14.5 percent. N.Y. Tax Law §1145(a)(1)(ii); New York Tax Department: Interest Rates -- Period 10/01/16 - 12/31/2016. If the commissioner determines that the failure to pay or the delay in payment is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, then the commissioner may instead impose interest at the corporation tax late payment and assessment rate. N.Y. Tax Law §1145(a)(1); see N.Y. Dept. of Taxn. and Fin., Interest Rates. Each quarter, the New York Department of Taxation and Finance establishes interest rates for sales and use tax overpayments and underpayments. The rates compound daily. N.Y. Tax Law §1142(9).

Topic: Administration and Procedure Amnesty Programs 2010

Yes In 2010, the Penalty and Interest Discount Program (“PAID”Program) was established to encourage taxpayers to pay off their outstanding liabilities that were at least three years old. New York TSB-M-09(20)S (Dec. 14, 2009). A taxpayer who participated in the program received a reduction in the accrued interest and penalty currently owed on eligible tax liabilities. The Department of Taxation and Finance identified taxpayers with final assessments and determinations, and then calculated a new reduced amount based on the outstanding tax, interest, and penalties for each liability owed. Notices were sent to each eligible taxpayer, stating the new tax liability calculated under the program in January 2010. The program ran from Jan. 15, 2010, to March 15, 2010. The taxpayer could choose to make full, partial, or zero payment for one or more of the eligible liabilities; however, full payment on an eligible liability had to be made by March 15, 2010, to qualify for the reduction in liability. New York TSB-M-09(20)S (Dec. 14, 2009). If the assessment or final determination was issued on or before Dec. 31, 2003, the amount due included the underlying tax liability and only 20 percent of the accrued interest and penalty. Accordingly, the savings was 80 percent of the accrued interest and penalty. New York TSB-M-09(20)S (Dec. 14, 2009). If the assessment or final determination was issued after Dec. 31, 2003, and on or before Dec. 31, 2006, the amount due included the underlying tax liability and only 50 percent of the accrued interest and penalty. As a result, the savings was 50 percent of the accrued interest and penalty. New York TSB-M-09(20)S (Dec. 14, 2009). BNA-SUTN NY 31.14.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Voluntary Disclosure Relief

Yes New York offers a Voluntary Disclosure and Compliance Program. N.Y. Tax Law §1700(3). Under this program, upon executing a voluntary disclosure and compliance agreement by the eligible taxpayer and commissioner, the commissioner waives any applicable penalties (including the additional rate of interest) for failure to pay any sales and use tax liability, failure to file a sales or use tax return or report, or failure to pay estimated tax. N.Y. Tax Law §1700(3). To qualify for the program, the taxpayer must be a person (e.g., individual, partnership, estate, trust, corporation, limited liability company, joint stock company, or any other company, trustee, receiver, assignee, referee, society, association, or business) who:• is not currently under audit by the department; • is one who is voluntarily disclosing a New York tax liability that the department has not determined, calculated, researched, or identified at the time of disclosure; • is not currently a party to any criminal investigation being conducted by an agency of New York or any political subdivision of New York;and • is not seeking to disclose participation in a tax avoidance transaction that is a federal or New York state reportable or listed transaction. N.Y. Tax Law §1700(2). To participate in the program, an eligible taxpayer must apply by submitting a disclosure statement. As long as all of the requirements of the voluntary disclosure and compliance program are met, no application will be denied solely because the taxpayer has admitted that the delinquency was the result of willful or fraudulent conduct. N.Y. Tax Law §1700(4). The New York State Department of Taxation and Finance has an online system for filing voluntary disclosures that requires identification of the delinquent taxpayer. New York Voluntary Disclosure and Compliance Program. The department will not use the taxpayer's disclosure as evidence in any proceeding brought against the taxpayer or reveal the contents of the disclosure to any law enforcement or other agency, except in situations where the taxpayer failed to comply with the terms of a voluntary disclosure and compliance agreement. However, disclosure of any returns or reports filed under this program with the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States or the proper tax officer of any state or city is permitted. N.Y. Tax Law §1700(4). A taxpayer must pay the tax and related interest that is the subject of the voluntary disclosure and compliance agreement when the agreement is executed or within the time stated on a bill issued to the taxpayer. The department may enter into an installment payment program with a taxpayer for the payment of tax and interest due when the commissioner is satisfied that the taxpayer cannot make immediate full payment of the disclosed tax liability. To qualify for the installment payment program the taxpayer may be required to submit a financial disclosure statement setting forth the taxpayer's current assets, liabilities, earnings, and other financial information before entering into an installment payment plan with the taxpayer. N.Y. Tax Law §1700(5)(a). If a taxpayer satisfies the requirements of a voluntary disclosure and compliance agreement, the taxpayer will not be subject to criminal prosecution in New York for his conduct. N.Y. Tax Law §1700(5)(a). If a taxpayer intentionally provides false material information or omits material information on his submission to the department, attempts to intentionally defeat or evade a tax due pursuant to the voluntary disclosure and compliance agreement, or intentionally fails to comply with the terms of the agreement, then the agreement will be rescinded. N.Y. Tax Law §1700(5)(b). BNA-SUTN NY 31.15.1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Voluntary Disclosure Look-Back Periods

Not Specified New York's voluntary disclosure and compliance program does not set a specific look-back period but allows taxpayers that owe for more than three years to request a limited look-back clause during the application process. N.Y. Tax Law § 1700;N.Y. Taxn. and Fin., Voluntary Disclosure and Compliance Program - Limited Look-Back. The department will consider adding the clause in specific circumstances. When the taxpayer has collected sales and withholding tax and not remitted them to the state, the look-back period could be limited to six years. In cases of tax fraud or evasion, not including trust taxes, the look-back period could be limited to six years. N.Y. Taxn. and Fin., Voluntary Disclosure and Compliance Program - Limited Look-Back. When the taxpayer claims mistake, confusion, ignorance of the law, inability to comply or some similar explanation in cases not involving collected trust taxes, the look-back period will likely be set at three years.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Voluntary Disclosure Multistate Tax Commission (MTC) Program

Does Not Participate New York does not participate in the Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program(MVDP). Multistate Tax Commission, Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program. The MVDP allows taxpayers with outstanding tax liabilities in multiple states to negotiate settlements via a process coordinated by the National Nexus Program (NNP) staff of the MTC. Multistate Tax Commission, Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program. To participate in the MVDP, the taxpayer must:• have a minimum good-faith tax liability estimate of $500 or more; • not have been contacted by a state or commission regarding taxes due;and • submit a completed Voluntary Disclosure Agreement (VDA) including taxpayer's contact information, tax year, list of states to receive the proposed VDA, description of taxpayer's activities in each state, and estimate of taxes due. Multistate Tax Commission, Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program. The program is intended to incentivize taxpayers to begin filing and paying taxes in all of the states in which they have substantial nexus. Upon entering into a voluntary disclosure agreement with a state, taxpayers will be required to file returns, pay the tax due and accrued interest on the returns, and register with the state in exchange for waiver of penalties for the entire look-back period. Taxpayers are not charged to participate in the MVDP. BNA-SUTN NY 31.15.3.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Audits

Authorized For the purpose of determining the correct amount of sale and use tax due, the Department of Taxation and Finance has the authority to examine and audit the records, books, or other relevant information that taxpayers are required to maintain relating to sales and use tax. N.Y. Tax Law §1138(a)(1). When the taxpayer fails to provide books and records of sales, the department can reasonably conclude that the taxpayer failed to maintain or retain books and records of sales. The department may then use the indirect method to determine taxpayer's sales tax liability. In re Sacher, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 824107 (Jan. 16, 2014); see also In re Edelweiss Catering, Inc., New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision Nos. 825911 and 825963 (Dec. 16, 2016) (tribunal affirmed the ALJ's determination that indirect method of determining tax liability was appropriate because taxpayer failed to maintain accurate records and conceded use of estimates to report sales tax). If necessary, the tax may be estimated on the basis of external indices, such as stock on hand, purchases, rental paid, number of rooms, location, scale of rents or charges, comparable rents or charges, type of accommodations and service, number of employees, or other factors. N.Y. Tax Law §1138(a)(1); In re J & L Donut Shop, Inc., New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 823143 (Sept. 13, 2012) (use of rent factor audit methodology to determine tax due by restaurant operator ruled proper); see, e.g., In re Institutional Inv'r, Inc., New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 826331 (June 23, 2016). The department can use any indirect method of audit that will reasonably calculate the amount of tax due. In re Edelweiss Catering, Inc., New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision Nos. 825911 and 825963 (Dec. 16, 2016) (department's use of a one-day observation test to determine tax liability was a proper audit method due to taxpayer's inadequate books and records); In re Laham, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 825802 (Dec. 3, 2015), aff'd, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 825802 (Oct. 27, 2016) (the estimated audit methodology utilizing the Almanac of Business and Financial Ratios to determine gross sales was proper in absence of any other records or books to determine taxable sales; the use of rent as a basis for projecting sales is an approved method); In re 4 U Convenience, Inc., New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision Nos. 824971 and 824972 (Feb. 12, 2016) (in the absence of complete or imprecise records, the department may contact suppliers in order to determine prepaid sales tax, in order to properly calculate prepaid sales tax credits claimed); Wolkowicki v. New York Tax Appeals Trib., 136 A.D.3d 1223, 2016 BL 55961 (N.Y. App. Div. 2016) (it is proper to use an audit method approved by the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade when calculating sales and use taxes for taxicab leases); In re Majestic Deli Grocery, Inc., New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision Nos. 825624 and 825625 (April 14, 2017) (various methods were used during an audit of a deli because the records were incomplete, incorrect, or were not provided during the audit); In re Grand Cent. JT VT, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 825201 (March 10, 2016) (taxable sales ratios from an earlier audit can be used in a subsequent audit); In re Henry St. Superior Deli Corp., New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision Nos. 826222 and 826223 (Feb. 21, 2017) (use of the National Restaurant Association's Restaurant Industry Operations Report (“RIOR”) to compute gross sales is proper when auditing taxpayers, such as a deli, without evidence that classification as a deli is improper). For example, using a “test period” is an acceptable audit method. See, e.g., In re Top Drawer Custom Cabinetry Corp., New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 825588 (Nov. 19, 2015); In re Crystal Clear Pool Serv., Inc., New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 826209 (March 17, 2016); In re CLM Assoc., LLC, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 826735 (Feb. 23, 2017) (rejecting all but one of taxpayer's requests for adjustments to audit utilizing a test period, a methodology agreed to by the taxpayer; taxpayer's presentation of an alternative methodology did not invalidate the Division of Taxation's audit), aff'd in part, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 826735 (Feb. 12, 2018). If an audit method is not reasonable, the audit results may be cancelled for lacking a rational basis. In re Majestic Deli Grocery, Inc., New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination Nos. 827533 (Nov. 15, 2018)(notices of determination for a taxpayer that made taxable and nontaxable food sales were cancelled because the presumption that all of taxpayer's non-food stamp sales were taxable was not reasonably calculated to reflect the taxes due). See In re Metro. Minimart Corp., New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination Nos. 826155 and 826156 (May 26, 2016) (notices of determination for a taxpayer were cancelled because the auditor treated the taxpayer's business as a limited service restaurant, instead of as a convenience store that does not sell gas, which was the more appropriate business classification). The department cannot, however, refuse to review books and records when the taxpayer makes the records readily available, especially if the audit report finds that the petitioner's records were adequate. The department must make a sufficient investigation of the records made available to it to justify a conclusion that the records were incapable of supporting a complete audit or provided an inadequate basis on which to determine the amount of tax due. The department cannot simply ignore a taxpayer's records and use an indirect method of estimating tax due. Expediency or inefficiency does not give the department the authority to ignore available records. In re Taveras, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 828051 (Feb. 7, 2019) (canceling the assessment because the division had not established that it examined the taxpayer's records or found them to be inadequate); In re Faldetta, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 823265 (Oct. 5, 2017) (cancelling a notice of determination based on an indirect audit method because the taxpayer had not been afforded a reasonable opportunity to produce its books and records); In re Helio, LLC, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 825010 (July 2, 2015), aff'g New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 825010 (June 12, 2014). The Department of Taxation and Finance also has the authority to summon records, books, and witnesses to give testimony necessary to determine the correct sales and use tax owed. N.Y. Tax Law §1143(a). A justice of the Supreme Court, either in court or at chambers, has the power summarily to enforce by property proceedings the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production and examination of books, papers, and documents called for by the subpoena of the department. N.Y. Tax Law §1143(b). Witnesses appearing in response to a summons or subpoena of the Department of Taxation and Finance are entitled to the same fees as allowed to witnesses in civil cases in courts of record. N.Y. Tax Law §1143(c). False Claims Act In addition to audits, individuals may bring claims against taxpayers that used a false record to avoid an obligation to pay the government. This is typically known as a “reverse false claim.” To allege a reverse false claim, a plaintiff must allege facts tending to show “(1) that the defendant made, used, or caused to be used a [material] record or statement to conceal, avoid, or decrease an obligation to [the government]; (2) that the statement or record was false; (3) that the defendant knew that the statement or record was false; and (4) that [the state] suffered damages as a result.” The damages pleaded in such an action must exceed$350,000. N.Y. State Fin. Law §189(1)(g); People ex rel. Hunter v. Starbucks Corp., 2018 NY Slip Op 28123, 2018 BL 146196 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2018). Plaintiffs must plead sufficient factual allegations for a Court to draw the reasonable inference that a taxpayer knowingly made or used false records to conceal, avoid, or decrease its obligation to pay sales tax, and that the State suffered substantial damages as a result. Allegations that demonstrate only negligence or carelessness on the part of some employees are insufficient to draw a reasonable inference that the failure to collect the full amount of taxes was designed to conceal, reduce, or avoid a taxpayer's obligation to pay sales tax. N.Y. State Fin. Law §189(1)(g); People ex rel. Hunter v. Starbucks Corp., 2018 NY Slip Op 28123, 2018 BL 146196 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2018). Additionally, if using a survey to demonstrate the statutory pleading requirement of $350,000, a plaintiff must use a scientifically valid sampling and survey to prove alleged damages. N.Y. State Fin. Law §189(1)(g); People ex rel. Hunter v. Starbucks Corp., 2018 NY Slip Op 28123, 2018 BL 146196 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2018). BNA-SUTN NY 31.16.

Permitted The issuance of a notice of determination of sales tax deficiency, interest, or penalty triggers a 90-day deadline for protesting such determination. N.Y. Tax Law §2000; In re Papaye Rest., Inc., New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 826418 (May 12, 2016). Taxpayers must generally file a protest of a notice of determination within 90 days of the mailing of such notice. N.Y. Tax Law §1138(a)(1); see In re Pan Steel, LLC., New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 828322 (May 24, 2018) (protest was rejected because the request was not timely filed); In re Bayside Food Corp., New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 828310 (May 17, 2018) (where timeliness is at issue, the initial burden is on the department to demonstrate the fact and date of the mailing to petitioner's last known address); In re Mr. Septic, LLC, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 828348 (April 19, 2018)(protest was rejected because the request was not timely filed); In re Ahmed, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 827803 (April 10, 2018) (where Division of Taxation established notice was properly mailed to representative and taxpayer, tracking information is insufficient to rebut presumption of receipt); In re Abramowitz, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 828023 (March 1, 2018) (noting that the 90 day limit is strictly enforced, and that a protest can be rejected even if one day late); New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 828214 (Feb. 22, 2018); In re Bitefood, Ltd., New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 828008 (July 6, 2017) (dismissing taxpayer's petition after the 90-day period expired when the Division of Taxation submitted proof that the notice of determination was mailed on the date indicated to both the taxpayer and its representatives and that standard mailing protocols had been followed); In re Montana, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 826728 (Feb. 11, 2016) (dismissing protest made several years after the statute of limitations had expired after Division of Taxation established proper mailing of notices to taxpayer's last known address); In re Garitta, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 827065 (Feb. 4, 2016), aff'd, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 827065 (Feb. 21, 2017) (dismissing protest made almost 20 years after notices of deficiency were mailed to the petitioner). But see In re Marin, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 826378 (Aug. 31, 2017) (tolling the statute of limitations where the paperwork submitted by the division to prove proper mailing was incomplete). As with mailed notices, where the Division of Taxation and Finance furnishes a notice to petitioner by means of electronic communication, proper issuance of the subject notices is presumptive evidence of a taxpayer's receipt of such notices. Accordingly, similar to a physical mailing situation, petitioner's mere denial of receipt of the notices is not sufficient to overcome this presumption. In re Urrego, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 827558 (July 12, 2018); In re Carlson, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 828491 (Dec. 13, 2018) (demonstrating petitioner created an online account, agreed to accept electronic communications, and was sent notices).

The DTA stated that the mailing of the order to an address where she never resided under that name raised a material issue of fact as to the proper mailing to Petitioner's last known address. The notice was withdrawn and the Division of Taxation was given 75 days from the date of the DTA's order to file an answer to Petitioner's petition); In re Reuben, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 827466 (April 19, 2018)(determination was properly sent to the address entered by the taxpayer in the Division's online system, even though the address was incorrect). A taxpayer's last known address is the address given in the last return filed by the taxpayer or if no return has been filed, then such address as may be obtainable. In re Sarmiento, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 828059 (Dec. 20, 2018). However, if the taxpayer is a responsible person for a corporate entity, the entity's timely appeal is deemed to be a timely protest by the taxpayer even if the taxpayer's appeal would otherwise be untimely. In re Peak Security Plus, Inc., New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination Nos. 828664, 828724 (April 25, 2019) (stating corporate officer did not lose his right to appeal, despite untimely responding, because the tax issues arose out of same audit as that of his company, and the incorrect address used for company's attorney when mailing the copy of the conciliation default order, which allowed company's appeal to be timely filed). If the notice was received but the exact date of mailing cannot be established, a petitioner is entitled to a hearing to challenge the assessment. In re Reuben, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 827466 (April 19, 2018)(citing In re Brager, New York Division of Tax Appeals, May 23, 1996). Where a notice was actually received, but the Division's proof fails to establish when it was mailed, the 90-day time period for filing a protest against that notice is not triggered until the date of petitioner's actual receipt of the notice is established. In re Khayer Kayumi, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 825953 (Nov. 20, 2018). If the taxpayer is dissatisfied with the result of the audit, he may file a petition for a hearing with the Division of Tax Appeals, or request an informal hearing with the Bureau of Conciliation and Mediation Services. N.Y. Tax Law §171(3-a). If the taxpayer consents to the result of the audit, they cannot subsequently challenge the propriety of the audit methodology or accuracy. In re Emerald Intl. Holdings, Ltd., New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 827189 (Aug. 10, 2017). Conciliation conferences are informal meetings conducted by a conciliation conferee with the purpose of resolving taxpayer disputes in a quick and inexpensive manner without resorting to a formal hearing.

If a dispute is not resolved on audit or through the conciliation process, the next step is requesting a hearing before the Division of Tax Appeals. The Division, which adjudicates disputes between the department and taxpayers, is managed and operated by the Tax Appeals Tribunal. N.Y. Tax Law §2000. Once the petition is filed, the office of counsel must serve an answer on the petitioner within 75 days from the date the supervising administrative judge acknowledges receipt of the petition in proper form.

The Tax Appeals Tribunal has certain requirements for what should be included with a proper petition. Where a petition is not in proper form, the supervising administrative law judge will provide petitioner with a statement indicating the requirements with which the petition does not comply, and allow the petitioner an additional 30 days to file a corrected petition with the supervising administrative law judge. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, § 3000.3(d)(1); New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 828868 (June 27, 2019). A petition that is found to not be in proper form and goes uncorrected once the taxpayer is informed of the need to correct, will be at risk for dismissal by the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). However, it is up to the ALJ's discretion to dismiss the case based on statutory guidance that the purpose of pleadings is to provide the parties and the division fair notice of the matters in controversy and the basis for the positions of said parties, while broadly analyzing the pleadings so as to do substantial justice. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, § 3000.3; N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, § 3000.4(a). See In re Taveras, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 828051 (July 20, 2017) (Taxpayer challenged a notice of determination, but failed to include a copy of the conciliation order in his petition. However, the taxpayer included in his notice, a copy of a letter from the Bureau of Conciliation and Mediation Services indicating that the conciliation order was sent, his case number, and taxpayer's address. The Division of Taxation moved to dismiss the appeal arguing the petition was not in a proper form because it did not include a copy of the conciliation order. The Board of Tax Appeals observed that ALJ's may exercise discretion in deciding whether to dismiss a case as a result of a petition lacking formality. Although the taxpayer's petition lacked a conciliation order, his petition still identified the subject notice of determination by number, and number and existence of the conciliation order. As such, the ALJ found that the Taxpayer's petition put the Division of Taxation on fair notice of the substance of the controversy. Therefore, the Division of Taxation's motion to dismiss was denied); In re Emerald International Holdings, LTD, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination Nos. 827663 and 827664 (Oct. 3, 2018) (Administrative Law Judge property granted default judgment because petitioner's conscious decision not to appear based on its president's dissatisfaction with the denial of his motion to recuse was not an acceptable excuse for failure to appear at the hearing, as well as petitioner failed to establish a meritorious case because of lack of evidence). The taxpayer generally bears the burden of proof at the hearing. However, on certain issues, the department has the burden of proof, including:• whether the taxpayer has been guilty of fraud with an intent to evade taxes; • whether the petitioner is liable as the transferee of property of a taxpayer; • whether the taxpayer is liable for an increase in a deficiency assessed after a notice of deficiency is mailed and a petition filed; • whether the taxpayer is liable for the civil penalty of filing a frivolous return; and • whether the taxpayer is liable for the civil penalty for aiding in the making of a fraudulent tax return. • whether a form of notice was mailed to the taxpayer, if the timeliness of a petition is at issue. N.Y. Tax Law §689(e). See In re Taveras, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 828051 (July 20, 2017). Either the taxpayer or the department may request a review Division of Tax Appeals' determination by the Tax Appeals Tribunal. The request must be made within 30 days. N.Y. Tax Law §2006(7); see, e.g., In re Jake Rest. Corp., New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 826645 (April 14, 2016) (the taxpayer's request for an exception was postmarked after the 30-day time period has expired; thus, the request was not granted). Extensions of time to file an exception for good cause shown can be made within the time period for filing the exception. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §3000.17. A determination issued by an administrative law judge in the Division of Tax Appeals will finally decide the matters in controversy, unless a party timely requests review by the Tax Appeals Tribunal. N.Y. Tax Law §1147(d); N.Y. Tax Law §2010.4; In re Taveras Sister, Inc., New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 828050 (where a taxpayer did not timely appeal a Division of Tax Appeals determination, a taxpayer may not file a second petition in protest of the same assessment); see also In re GRJH, Inc., New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 825192 (Jan. 15, 2015) (appeal was not timely filed). A decision of the Tax Appeals Tribunal will be final upon the expiration of the period specified in §1138(a)(4), if no application for review has been timely made, or if such application has been timely made, upon the expiration of the time for all further judicial review, or upon the issuance of a decision by the Tax Appeals Tribunal in accordance with the mandate of the court of review. N.Y. Tax Law §1147(d); see In re Good-Will Mech. Corp., New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 825952 (Sept. 3, 2015) (taxpayers have 30 days to file an exception to an administrative law judge determination in order to appeal the determination). Within four months following notice of the decision of the Tax Appeals Tribunal, the taxpayer may seek judicial review in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court by instituting an Article 78 proceeding. Importantly, the department may not seek judicial review of an adverse decision by the tribunal. Appeals from the tribunal are taken to the Appellate Division, Third Department, and from there to the New York Court of Appeals. Ultimately, taxpayers may petition for certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court. There are no extensions of time available for filing the Article 78 proceeding. N.Y. Tax Law §2016; see SunGard Capital Corp. v. New York State Dept. of Taxn. & Fin., 2018 N.Y. Slip Op 07539 (N.Y. App. Div., 2018) (court held that taxpayer should not have filed an appeal with the New York Appellate Division before audit is complete, taxpayer is assessed tax, and all administrative remedies exhausted. Thus, the case was dismissed since the case was not ripe). In certain circumstances, a taxpayer may not be limited to pursuing administrative remedies through the Tax Appeals Tribunal and appears by way of CPLR Article 78 review. When a tax statute is alleged to be unconstitutional (as applied or facially), or if the Department did not have jurisdiction over the taxpayer or the matter that was taxed, then the taxpayer may move directly to seek a declaratory judgment from a court if no factual issues are raised. Metro Enters. Corp. v. N.Y. State Dept. of Taxn. & Fin., No. 526657, 2019 BL 138305 (N.Y. App. Div. April 18, 2019) (citing Bankers Trust Corp. v. New York City Dept. of Fin., 805 N.E.2d 92 (N.Y. 2003) and Kallenberg Meat Prods., Inc. v. O'Cleireacain, 209 A.D.2d 381 (N.Y. App. Div. 1994)); R &G Outfitters, Inc. v. Bouchard, 101 A.D.2d 642, 475 N.Y.S.2d 549 (N.Y. App. Div. 1984). Confidentiality of Tax Returns Like most states, New York protects taxpayers'returns and reports from being disclosed to the public, unless disclosure is required by ”proper judicial order” or by law. Thus, state personnel who maintain custody of returns and reports cannot be required to produce such returns or reports, or the information contained therein, in a court action or proceeding except: 1) where the state or the tax commission is party to the action; or 2) on behalf of any party to a tax proceeding when the documents or information therein are directly involved in the action or proceeding. Additionally, with respect to a hearing, the tax commission may require the production of only that portion of such documents or information that is pertinent to the hearing and no more. N.Y. Tax Law §1146(a). Consequently, the motion of a telecommunications company who, during a sales tax proceeding, sought from the Department of Taxation and Finance the disclosure of documents “sufficient to identify every provider of mobile telecommunications voice services... that has paid sales tax related to those services,” was found to have been properly denied. However, the court granted the company's motion with respect to its request for documents evidencing other taxpayers' opinions about tax issues like, debundling, the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act, 2002 amendments to New York's tax law, a 2002 Technical Services Bureau Memorandum, and other information. The court found that such information was not protected return or report information and could not be withheld, and directed the Department to redact taxpayers' names from such disclosed documents. New York v. Sprint Commc'ns Inc., 148 A.D.3d 471, 2017 BL 82067 (N.Y. App. Div. 2017). BNA-SUTN NY 31.17.
