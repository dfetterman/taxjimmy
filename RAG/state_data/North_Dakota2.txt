Topic: Administration and Procedure Agencies Responsible for Administration Local Sales and Use Tax

North Dakota Office of State Tax Commissioner In North Dakota local taxes are administered by the North Dakota Office of State Tax Commissioner as North Dakota law requires local jurisdictions to enter into collection agreements with the Tax Commissioner. N.D. Cent. Code §57-01-02(2); North Dakota Guideline—Local Option Taxes by Location, effective Jan. 1, 2016. The Office of State Tax Commissioner assumes full responsibility for collection of the taxes including delinquency control, auditing and collection activity. Local option sales, use and gross receipts taxes are reported on the same form as the state sales taxes. However, city lodging taxes, city lodging and restaurant taxes and city motor vehicle rental taxes are reported to the State Tax Commissioner on separate forms. North Dakota Guideline—Local Option Taxes by Location, effective Jan. 1, 2016. North Dakota has authorized both cities and counties within the state to enact local sales and use taxes under their home rule charter, without limitation on the rate. N.D. Cent. Code §11-09.1-05(4); N.D. Cent. Code §40-05.1-06(2); N.D. Cent. Code §40-05.1-06(4). Counties and cities in North Dakota that impose local sales and use tax must contract with the state Tax Commissioner for administration of the tax. N.D. Cent. Code §11-09.1-05(4)(d); N.D. Cent. Code §40-05.1-06(4)(d); N.D. Cent. Code §57-01-02.1(1); see N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.4-02. Local governments within North Dakota that are responsible for collecting sales tax must obtain a sales tax permit from the Officer of State Tax Commissioner. North Dakota Guideline—Local Government Sales and Purchasers (Jan. 2006). Tax Administration in Standing Rock Reservation The governor, in consultation with the Tax Commissioner, may enter an agreement with the governing body of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe relating to administration and allocation of state and tribal sales and use taxes, imposed and collected within the exterior boundaries of the Standing Rock Reservation within North Dakota. N.D. Admin. Code §81-04.1-03-01, as enacted by 2015 N.D. H.B. 1406, effective Apr. 24, 2015. Since the Office of the State Tax Commissioner administers the tax, the state statute of limitations, sourcing rules, forms, and voluntary disclosure program apply to the local sales and use taxes. N.D. Cent. Code §11-09.1-05(4)(d); N.D. Cent. Code §40-05.1-06(4)(d); N.D. Cent. Code §57-01-02.1(1); see N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.4-02;phone conversation with N.D. Office of State Tax Comm'r, Dec. 1, 2010. When filing and paying local sales and use taxes, the taxpayer uses Form ST if he has less than 10 local option taxes to report. Office of State Tax Comm'r, Sales and Use Forms and Instructions. If the taxpayer has more than 10 local option taxes to report he will also use Schedule ST-Local.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Vendor/Seller Registration

Required A taxpayer must apply for and obtain a permit from the North Dakota Tax Commissioner before conducting business in the state. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-14(1). The application form includes identifying information such as the name under which the applicant intends to conduct business, the applicant's business location, and other similar information. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-14(1). A taxpayer registering under the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement must register in North Dakota. The taxpayer can cancel its registration at any time, but the taxpayer must still remit its liability to the Office of State Tax Commissioner on any sales taxes collected before the cancellation date. Registration under the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement alone is insufficient to create nexus with North Dakota. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-14(1). After determining that the applicant is a bona fide retailer, the Commissioner will grant a permit to the applicant for each in-state business location. The permit is not assignable and is valid only for use at the applicant's stated address or addresses. The taxpayer must display the permit conspicuously at each location. If the taxpayer is a transient vendor, then it must display the permit to each prospective customer before conducting any transaction. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-14(2). After the taxpayer obtains a permit, the permit is valid unless and until the Commissioner revokes it. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-14(3). The Commissioner can revoke the permit if the taxpayer fails to comply with North Dakota sales and use tax law. The Commissioner can also revoke the permit if the taxpayer files returns showing no tax due for four consecutive quarters. However, the Commissioner must allow a hearing before revoking the permit and must provide written notice to the taxpayer at least 10 days before the hearing. At the hearing, the taxpayer bears the burden of proof to establish that the Commissioner should not revoke its permit. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-14(4). The Commissioner also can restore a revoked permit. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-14(4). If the Commissioner revoked it because the taxpayer failed to comply with North Dakota sales and use tax law, then the taxpayer must pay $50 for the restored permit. But if the Commissioner revoked it because the taxpayer filed returns showing no tax due for four consecutive quarters, then the taxpayer must pay only $5 for the restored permit. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-14(5). BNA-SUTN ND 31.2.

Code §57-39.2-11(2), as amended by 2017 N.D. S.B. 2129, effective July 1, 2017. The commissioner can create a unique filing period for the taxpayer to secure payment and ensure compliance with the sales and use tax law. A taxpayer with a monthly filing and payment period must file its tax return no later than the last day of the month following the month for which the return is being filed. Thus, a taxpayer filing a monthly return for January has filed timely if it submits the return by the last day in February. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-11(1); N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-12, as amended by 2019 N.D. S.B. 2089, §8, effective July 31, 2019; N.D. Admin. Code §81-04.1-01-08.1(1).

S.B. 2089, §8, effective July 31, 2019. A taxpayer filing on a quarterly basis must file no later than the last day of the month following the month ending the quarter for which the return is being filed. Thus, a taxpayer filing a tax return for the first quarter (i.e., January, February, and March) has filed timely if it submits the return by the last day in April. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-11(1); N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-12, as amended by 2019 N.D. S.B. 2089, §8, effective July 31, 2019.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Direct Pay Permits

Authorized A taxpayer can obtain a direct pay permit from the North Dakota Tax Commissioner. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-14.1. The direct pay permit authorizes the taxpayer to make direct payment of any sales or use tax imposed upon any purchase, use, storage, or consumption within the state of tangible personal property or services. Thus, the direct pay permit-holder can present the permit to any retailer from whom the permit-holder purchases tangible personal property, which relieves the retailer of any duty to collect tax. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-14.1; N.D. Admin. Code §81-04.1-01-05. To qualify for a direct pay permit, a business must demonstrate that the business:• purchases substantial amounts of tangible personal property for business use under circumstances that make it difficult or impractical at the time of purchase to determine whether such property is subject to sales or use tax; • holds or has applied for a sales and use tax permit; • will materially reduce its administrative collection work by moving to the direct payment method; • has an accounting system that will clearly reflect the proper amount of tax due; and • makes taxable purchases in sufficient volume to justify the expense of regular audits by the Office of the State Tax Commissioner. N.D. Admin. Code §81-04.1-01-05. To obtain a direct pay permit, a taxpayer must submit an application to the North Dakota Tax Commissioner. The application must contain a letter detailing the applicant's:• name; • address; • sales and use tax account number; • business description; • accounting system; • purchase volume; and • justification for adopting the direct payment method. N.D. Admin. Code §81-04.1-01-05. The Commissioner issues direct pay permits at his or her discretion, and only when doing so is in North Dakota's best interest. Once approved, the applicant taxpayer receives a direct pay permit. The Commissioner (or a representative) individually numbers, dates, and signs each direct pay permit. N.D. Admin. Code §81-04.1-01-05. A direct pay permit-holder must:• issue the permit to all vendors from whom the permit-holder is making purchases that are subject to sales or use taxation; or • maintain accounting records sufficient to show the amount of sales tax paid to retailers in a given reporting period. N.D. Admin. Code §81-04.1-01-05. If the permit-holder chooses the first option, then the permit-holder must maintain a list of all relevant vendors. The Commissioner may request to see the permit-holder's list at any time, and the permit-holder must make the list available to the Commissioner. N.D. Admin. Code §81-04.1-01-05. Alternatively, if the permit-holder chooses the second option, then all purchases from any one supplier must be either exempt or taxable—the vendor may not assess sales tax on selected transactions only. N.D. Admin. Code §81-04.1-01-05. A permit-holder may not use the direct pay permit to purchase:• taxable food or beverages; • taxable lodging or related services; • admission to places of amusement or athletic events. • amusement devices. N.D. Admin. Code §81-04.1-01-05(7). Further, the direct payment permit is not transferable, and the Commissioner may revoke it at any time with or without cause. N.D. Admin. Code §81-04.1-01-05(8). BNA-SUTN ND 31.8.10.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Record-Keeping Requirements

3 Years In North Dakota, every retailer required to file and pay sales tax and each person subject to use tax must keep all records, receipts, invoices, and other papers for at least three years and three months. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-10; N.D. Cent. Code §57-40.2-09. Upon reasonable notice from the Commissioner or an authorized agent, the taxpayer must make the documents available for examination and investigation into the accuracy of any return filed with the state. The Commissioner or agent may also use the records to determine the amount of tax due if the taxpayer did not file a return. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-10; N.D. Cent. Code §57-40.2-09. If a retailer accepts a legitimate resale certificate for a sale that would otherwise be subject to sales tax, then the retailer is relieved from submitting the sales tax upon the purchase price of the merchandise sold. But if a person submits a false resale certificate to the retailer, then the person submitting the certificate is personally liable to pay tax on the sale. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-10(2). BNA-SUTN ND 31.9.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Refunds

Both If North Dakota owes a refund to a taxpayer, the Tax Commissioner must certify the refund amount and the reason why the refund is being issued. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-25(1). The commissioner would then request that the Office of Management and Budget issue a check to the taxpayer equal to the refund owed. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-25(1). The North Dakota Tax Commissioner can disallow a taxpayer's claim for a refund. To do so, the Commissioner must notify the taxpayer of the decision, and the taxpayer has 30 days to appeal the denial. The 30-day period begins on the date of the Commissioner's written notice. If the taxpayer fails to act within 30 days, then the Commissioner's denial of the refund becomes final and irrevocable. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-25(2). Lastly, certain jurisdictions impose a cap on the amount of sales tax that must be paid on a single transaction. N.D. Cent. Code §11-09.1-05(4); N.D. Cent. Code §40-05.1-06(4); see N.D. Cent. Code §57-01-02.1(5); North Dakota Guideline—Local Option Taxes by Location, effective Jan. 1, 2016. Refund of Local Option Taxes Certain counties and cities have enacted caps on the amount of local sales tax that can apply to any transaction. N.D. Cent. Code §11-09.1-05(4); N.D. Cent. Code §40-05.1-06(2); N.D. Cent. Code §40-05.1-06(4); North Dakota Guideline—Local Option Taxes by Location, effective Jan. 1, 2016. Retailers have the option of collecting sales tax only up to the cap amount or collecting the entire amount of sales tax on the transaction, regardless of the cap amount. If the retailer collects tax on a sale in excess of the cap amount, the purchaser can file for a refund. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-25; North Dakota Guideline—Local Option Taxes by Location, effective Jan. 1, 2016. A taxpayer may claim this refund by completing a Claim for Refund of City or County Sales and Use Tax Transmittal form and filing it with the North Dakota Office of State Tax Commissioner. The retailer should be consistent with whichever method is used. North Dakota Sales Tax Newsletter December 2010. Beginning July 1, 2007, retailers may voluntarily collect up to the cap amount as a convenience to their customers so the purchasers do not need to apply for a refund. Retailers are not required to calculate caps and may continue to collect tax without regard to the caps. Retailers should be consistent in the method they choose to calculate local taxes. North Dakota Guideline—Local Option Taxes by Location, effective Jan. 1, 2016. Prior to October 2005, most local sales taxes included a maximum tax provision commonly referred to as the refund cap. This maximum tax provision or refund cap was the maximum amount of tax that could be applied to a single transaction. Under the refund program put in place in October 2005 to replace the caps, a retailer is required to collect tax on the entire sale without considering the caps. If the purchaser paid more than the maximum tax amount on a purchase, the purchaser could apply to the Tax Commissioner for a refund of any tax paid in excess of the cap. North Dakota Guideline—Local Option Taxes by Location, effective Oct. 1, 2016. A taxpayer is eligible for refund from the State Tax Commissioner for the difference between the amount of the city and county sales and use taxes paid, and the amount that would have been due by application of the cap provided by the city or county ordinance, resolution or charter. N.D. Cent. Code §57-01-02.1(5). For a detailed calculation of the maximum amount for each city or county and instructions for filing for a refund, refer to the North Dakota Office of State Tax Commissioner website for Sales and Use Tax Form Claim for Refund of City or County Sales and Use Tax Transmittal.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Voluntary Disclosure Relief

Yes North Dakota offers a Voluntary Disclosure Program that allows companies to voluntarily and anonymously approach the Office of the State Tax Commissioner to resolve its outstanding tax liability. N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-19; North Dakota Guideline Voluntary Disclosure Program (March 2012). The commissioner's disclosure representative reviews voluntary disclosure requests. The representative considers each request separately on its own facts. If the representative approves a request, then the disclosing company receives two copies of the proposed agreement. The company must complete and sign one of the two copies and return it to the Tax Commissioner within 60 days from the date on which the agreement was mailed to the company. North Dakota Guideline Voluntary Disclosure Program (March 2012). If a company collects all sales tax due but fails to remit it to North Dakota, then the Commissioner may, in his or her discretion, conditionally waive all penalties, on the condition that the company pays in full all outstanding tax liabilities with interest. North Dakota Guideline Voluntary Disclosure Program (March 2012). To be eligible for the North Dakota Voluntary Disclosure Program, a company must have been required to file a return with the state for a tax type that is subject to the program. Furthermore, as the program's name suggests, the disclosure of unpaid tax liabilities must be voluntary. Therefore, any company previously contacted regarding its tax liability by either North Dakota or the Multistate Tax Commission does not qualify for the amnesty program. North Dakota Guideline Voluntary Disclosure Program (March 2012). A company may contact the commissioner anonymously if it wishes to enter into or learn more about North Dakota's Voluntary Disclosure Program. To enter into a voluntary disclosure agreement, the company must provide a written disclosure statement containing:• a brief description of the company's activities; • the number of years the company has been doing business in North Dakota; • the type of tax or taxes involved; • the company's explanation for the failure to register or file and pay the taxes for past activities; • a statement of whether North Dakota sales or use taxes were collected; • a statement that the company has not been previously contacted by the Office of State Tax Commissioner or by the Multistate Tax Commission; • the company's proposed voluntary disclosure agreement terms; and • an estimate of the tax liability for the period covered by the proposed disclosure agreement. North Dakota Guideline Voluntary Disclosure Program (March 2012). The company may preserve confidentiality by not revealing until the agreement is finalized its name or any information that could identify it during any stage of the Voluntary Disclosure process.
