Wyo. Regs. ch. 2 §7(b); Wyoming Sales and Use Tax Bulletin- Exemption Certificate. The exemption certificates are to be in the format adopted by the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement and retained in the selling vendor's records. When the purchaser hands over a completed exemption certificate, the seller is relieved from liability for the tax. Wyo. Regs. ch. 2 §7(b); Wyoming Sales and Use Tax Bulletin- Exemption Certificate. Exemption certificates do not expire and are valid so long as the customer is making recurring purchases and the exemption remains in effect. Wyoming Sales and Use Tax Bulletin- Exemption Certificate; Wyoming Taxing Issues - September 2014. Retention Periods The state does not specify the duration of time that a seller should retain exemption certificates, but the statute of limitations on assessing sales tax in Wyoming is three years after the date the return is filed. Therefore, a taxpayer should maintain such records for a minimum of three years from such filings. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-110(b).

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Good Faith Requirement

Yes A vendor's burden of proof that the sale is not taxable is satisfied with the good faith acceptance of an exemption certificate. Wyo. Regs. ch. 2 §7(b)(ii). Good faith means that the seller must obtain a certificate that claims an exemption that:• was statutorily available on the date of the transaction in the jurisdiction where the transaction is sourced; • could be applicable to the item being purchased; and • is reasonable for the purchaser's type of business; or obtain other information establishing that the transaction was not subject to the tax.

Stat. §39-15-107.1(a). Direct pay permits are only granted to organizations that make five million dollars or more in annual purchases. Wyoming Sales and Use Tax Bulletin - Direct Pay Permit.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Refunds

Vendor Wyoming provides that a taxpayer must file a claim for a refund for erroneously paid, computed, or remitted taxes within 3 years from the date of the overpayment. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-109(c). All refund requests must be approved or denied within 90 days of the filing. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-109(c). The proper party to file a refund request is the purchaser. Wyoming Administrative Decision No. 2017-59 (April 17, 2018) (taxpayer who paid the tax erroneously levied on a purchaser was not the proper party to file a refund request). Any tax, penalty, or interest that has been erroneously paid, collected or computed, with approval, will be credited against any subsequent tax liability or may be refunded to the vendor. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-109(c)(i); Wyo. Stat. §39-16-109(c)(i); Wyo. Regs. ch. 2 §8(c); see also Wyoming State Bd. of Equal. v. Buggy Bath Unlimited Inc., 18 P.3d 1182 (Wyo. 2001). If a vendor collects tax erroneously, and those taxes are remitted to the department, the vendor can seek a refund or credit. However, the request can only be made after the vendor has refunded the erroneously collected tax to the taxpayer that originally paid it. If the vendor cannot identify the original taxpayer, the tax will not be refunded or credited to the vendor's account. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-109(c)(i), as amended by 2016 Wyo. S.F. 20, effective July 1, 2016; Wyo. Stat. §39-15-109(d)(i), as amended by 2016 Wyo. S.F. 20, effective July 1, 2016; see also Wyoming Taxing Issues - March 2016 and Wyoming Taxing Issues - September 2016. But see In re Jedediah Corp., Wyoming Administrative Decision 2013-08 and Wyoming Administrative Decision 2013-50 (Oct. 9, 2015). In these two decisions, which were issued before Wyo. Stat. §39-15-109 was amended, an audit revealed that a vendor had underpaid sales tax on some business purchases but had also incorrectly over-collected tax on food sales. The vendor's request to offset the underpayment with the over-collected tax was denied, as was a subsequent refund request. The Department argued that the vendor should have refunded the over-collected taxes to its customers first before claiming a credit or refund. The State Board of Equalization disagreed because the statutory interpretations of Wyo. Stat. §39-15-109(c)(i) and Wyo. Stat. §39-15-109(d)(i) did not limit the right to file a claim for credit or refund by requiring that customers receive a refund from the vendor first. Customers had the option of recovering improperly collected tax directly from a vendor. BNA-SUTN WY 31.10.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Statute of Limitations Refund Requests

3 Years A taxpayer has a three year statute of limitations period, running from the date of overpayment, to bring an action to request a refund. The statute of limitations will be tolled upon the Department's receipt of a refund request. Wyo. Stat. §39-16-109(c)(i); see also Wyoming Administrative Decision No. 2017-59 (April 17, 2018) (tolling the statute of limitation after a refund claim was made by the wrong party). BNA-SUTN WY 31.11.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Statute of Limitations Assessment of Additional Tax

3 Years The Department of Revenue has a three year statute of limitation period to bring an action to recover interest, delinquent taxes, or interest on sales tax returns. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-110(b).

Stat. §39-16-110. BNA-SUTN WY 31.11.2.
