Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Construction Materials and Contracts Construction Materials and Contracts, Generally

Taxable Charges by a contractor to the consumer for construction materials and contracts are not subject to sales tax. R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-54.6, replacing R.I. Regs. SU 91-27, effective July 31, 2018. Contractors are responsible for paying the sales and use tax on any materials, supplies, tools and equipment, purchased, used, or rented within the state in fulfilling a construction contract. R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-54.6, replacing R.I. Regs. SU 91-27, effective July 31, 2018; see R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-55.5, replacing R.I. Regs. SU 87-28, effective July 31, 2018. In situations where contractors fabricate tangible personal property to be used in the completion of a construction contract, the contractor is responsible for paying sales tax on the materials used in fabricating the tangible personal property. R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-54.6, replacing R.I. Regs. SU 91-27, effective July 31, 2018; see R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-55.5, replacing R.I. Regs. SU 87-28, effective July 31, 2018. However, where the contractor acts as a retailer of tangible personal property, sales tax is due on the sales to the consumer and the contractor is responsible for collecting and remitting the tax. Where the construction contract requires that the contractor sell materials, tools, or supplies at an agreed upon price, in addition to providing services in connection with the construction project, the contractor is not responsible for paying sales tax, but is responsible for collecting the tax due on the sale from the purchaser of the tangible personal property. R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-54.6, replacing R.I. Regs. SU 91-27, effective July 31, 2018; see R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-55.5, replacing R.I. Regs. SU 87-28, effective July 31, 2018. Likewise, where the contractor is engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property, the contractor is responsible for collecting the sales tax due on the sale of such items. R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-54.6, replacing R.I. Regs. SU 91-27, effective July 31, 2018; see R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-55.5, replacing R.I. Regs. SU 87-28, effective July 31, 2018. Where contractors are in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail, and are required to install a complete unit of standard equipment without any further fabrication, the sale is deemed to be a retail sale. The contractor should separately state the charge for the tangible personal property and the charge for installation as the sales tax is only applicable to the sale of the property. R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-54.6, replacing R.I. Regs. SU 91-27, effective July 31, 2018; see R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-55.5, replacing R.I. Regs. SU 87-28, effective July 31, 2018. Nonresident Contractors Any organization in Rhode Island entering into a construction contract with a nonresident contractor, or a contractor who does not maintain a regular place of business within the state, is required to withhold 3 percent of the contract price to ensure that the contractor pays all sales and use tax due to the state. Once the construction contract has been completed, the nonresident contractor must notify the Tax Administration, within 30 days, to come and audit the contractor's records for the project. The contractor must make available to the Tax Administration all of its records pertaining to sales and use tax. The Tax Administration must conduct the audit within 30 days of receipt of the notice from the contractor. The audit will result in a determination that no tax is due, or an issuance of a notice of tax. After the audit is completed, the organization withholding the 3 percent of the contract price must release the payment to the contractor. R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-54.6, replacing R.I. Regs. SU 91-27, effective July 31, 2018.

R.I. Gen. Laws §42-64.20-1; R.I. Gen. Laws §42-64.20-5(o). At the discretion of the commerce corporation, projects eligible for a tax credit under the Rebuild Rhode Island Tax Credit Act may be exempt from sales and use tax on purchases of property used directly and exclusively in the eligible project. R.I. Gen. Laws §42-64.20-3(8); R.I. Gen. Laws §42-64.20-5(o). The classes of exempt property include:• furniture, fixtures and equipment, except automobiles, trucks or other motor vehicles; and • depreciable materials, including construction materials and supplies, that have a useful life of one year or more and are essential to the project.
