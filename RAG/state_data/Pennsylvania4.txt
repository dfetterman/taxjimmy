Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Motor Vehicles, Intrastate or Non-Commercial Use Purchase, Lease, or Rental Transactions

Taxable Motor vehicles are generally subject to sales tax in Pennsylvania. 61 Pa. Code §31.2; 61 Pa. Code §31.44. Tax is based on the full purchase price, including financing and insurance charges, delivery fees, and warranty or service charges. Trade-in values are deducted from the full sales price for purposes of calculating the tax due. 61 Pa. Code §31.2; 61 Pa. Code §31.44; see also Pennsylvania Letter Ruling No. SUT-16-003 (Dec. 5, 2016)(an unrelated, separate, or independent sale of a vehicle is not considered a trade-in, even if the proceeds of the sale are immediately applied by the seller to the purchase of a vehicle from the person accepting the trade-in); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1603648 (Nov. 2, 2016) (service contracts and wheel/tire insurance are included in the purchase price of a vehicle). Vehicles are defined as every device in, upon, or by which a person or property is or may be transported or drawn upon a highway, except for devices used exclusively on tracks and except for mobile homes. 61 Pa. Code §31.41; Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1600731 (May 16, 2017) (taxpayer's chippers, tractors, skid steers, and cutters treated as vehicles for sales tax purposes). Transactions Not at Arm's Length If, because of affiliation of interests between the seller and purchaser, or for another reason, the purchase price stated is not indicative of the true value of the vehicle, then the purchase price is the vehicle's prevailing market price. 61 Pa. Code §31.44(b). Temporary Presence in State The use of a vehicle within Pennsylvania for a period of more than seven days, for any purpose other than leasing, makes the vehicle subject to use tax if the taxpayer is not a tourist or vacationer. 61 Pa.

Code §31.44(a); 61 Pa. Code §47.17(b). A lease agreement is a contract, whereby the lessee obtains or has the right to possession or custody of a vehicle in exchange for lease payments during a leasing period. 61 Pa. Code §47.17(b). In Pennsylvania, a lease period is defined as the interval of time established by the lessor and lessee that occurs between successive lease payments in accordance with the lease agreement. However, under Pennsylvania law, this interval may not exceed 31 days. 61 Pa. Code §47.17(b). For leases of motor vehicles, tax is imposed on each lease payment, even if such consideration is separately stated and is designated as payment for processing, service, maintenance, insurance, repairs, depreciation or otherwise. 61 Pa. Code §47.17(b)(i),(ii). Terminal Residual Adjustment Clause Leases(TRAC Leases) Leases that contain a “terminal residual adjustment clause,” or TRAC leases, guarantee lessors a certain residual price for the vehicle when the lease expires. In Pennsylvania, a TRAC lease is treated as a lease for sales and use tax purposes. Tax is due on payment for each lease period, as well as any payment made when exercising the option to buy the vehicle. 72 Pa. Stat. §7201(f); 61 Pa. Code §31.1(1); 61 Pa. Code §47.17(c)(1)(i)(C); 75 Pa. Cons. Stat. §1139; see also Pennsylvania Letter Ruling No. SUT-03-017 (May 2, 2008). Purchase Options and Nominal Purchase Option Pennsylvania treats purchase options as leases for sales and use tax purposes. Accordingly, tax is due on the monthly payments as well as on any payment made in exercising the option to buy. 72 Pa. Stat. §7201(f); 61 Pa. Code §31.1(1); 61 Pa. Code §47.17(c)(1)(i)(C); see also Pennsylvania Letter Ruling No. SUT-03-017 (May 2, 2008).

Sales to Nonresidents Motor vehicles, trailers, semitrailers, and bodies attached to the chassis of a motor vehicle are exempt from taxation if sold to a nonresident for use outside of Pennsylvania and registered outside of the Commonwealth within 20 days of delivery to the vendee. 72 Pa.
