Required A vendor engaging in the business of making any retail sales subject to sales and use tax must obtain a certificate of registration. D.C. Code Ann. §47-2026(a); D.C. Code Ann. §47-2212. Having a representative, agent salesman, canvasser, or solicitor operating in the District of Columbia for the purpose of making sales at retail, or the taking of orders qualifies a vendor as engaging in business in the District of Columbia; therefore, trade show attendees fitting this description are required to obtain a certificate of registration. D.C. Code Ann. §47-2026(a), D.C. Code Ann. §47-2212;D.C. Office of Tax & Rev., OTR's Guidance for Questions Involving Nexus (Nov. 1, 2002). See generally D.C. Code Ann. §47-2001(f). Each applicant for a certificate must make out and deliver to the Mayor a statement showing the name of the applicant, each retail establishment where the applicant's business is to be conducted, the kind or nature of the business and other information the Mayor may require. Upon receipt of the application the Mayor issues the applicant, without charge, a certificate of registration for each retail establishment designated in the application, authorizing the applicant to engage in business at the retail establishment. The certificate of registration is nontransferable, and must be displayed in the applicant's place of business. D.C. Code Ann. §47-2026(b), D.C. Code Ann. §47-2212. In the case of a vendor who has no fixed place of business and sells from 1 or more vehicles, each vehicle is considered a retail establishment. In the case of a vendor who has no fixed place of business and does not sell from a vehicle, the application for a certificate of registration should name the address to which any notice or other communication may be sent to the applicant, and the designated place will be considered the retail establishment. D.C. Code Ann. §47-2026(c), D.C. Code Ann. §47-2212. Anyone that engages in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail, or that makes any sale subject to sales or use tax without a certificate of registration will, upon conviction, be fined not more than $50 for each and every day that retail sales were made without possession of a registration certificate. D.C. Code Ann. §47-2026(d), D.C. Code Ann. §47-2212.

A claim for recovery may be made only in a proceeding in which the District of Columbia is not a party. D.C. Code Ann. §47-4491(e). The District of Columbia may also impose liens upon the personal property of corporate officers for unpaid sales and use taxes. Kelly v. District of Columbia, 765 A.2d 976 (D.C. 2001) A penalty is not imposed on an unpaid member of the board of trustees or directors of an organization exempt from tax under this title if the member:• is solely serving in an honorary capacity; D.C.

D.C. Code Ann. §47-4211(b)(1). A substantial valuation misstatement is the reporting of the value of a property or the adjusted basis of a property that is greater than or equal to 200 percent, or less than or equal to 50 percent, of the amount determined to be the correct amount of the valuation or adjusted basis. D.C. Code Ann. §47-4211(a)(4).

Topic: Administration and Procedure Voluntary Disclosure Relief

Yes The District of Columbia Office of Tax and Revenue (“OTR”)accepts applications from taxpayers for voluntary disclosure. D.C. Office of Tax and Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program. The OTR's position on voluntary disclosure agreements is determined by the facts and circumstances in each separate disclosure. D.C. Office of Tax and Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program. According to the OTR, the following are general guidelines for any voluntary disclosure applicant:• Any taxpayer can apply to remedy a sales or use tax obligation. • In most cases, OTR will agree to limit the look-back period to the lesser of three years or the date when the taxpayer established nexus in the District of Columbia. In egregious situations, however, OTR may require a five-year look-back period. • For sales or gross receipts tax cases, if the taxpayer collected sales tax or reimbursement for gross receipts tax from their customers, but did not remit the tax to the District of Columbia, the look-back period imposed will be the greater of five years or the date nexus was established in the District of Columbia. • If the tax liability in certain cases is a substantial amount, OTR may agree to establish a payment agreement if an adequate amount is paid up-front. However, if the taxpayer fails to make any scheduled payments in a timely manner, the agreement could be considered as null and void. OTR reserves the right to assess additional penalty and interest on the remaining balance of tax due at that time. • Nonprofits can use the voluntary disclosure process to report any prior-year taxes (i.e. franchise, personal property, sales, use, arena, etc.)that should have been paid. D.C. Office of Tax and Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program. Offers in Compromise The District of Columbia has an Offer in Compromise (OIC) program that allows taxpayers to settle outstanding debt for less than they owe. There are several scenarios that qualify for OIC:• You incurred a delinquent tax liability, resulting in an assessment; • You exhausted all other avenues of appeal regarding the validity or amount of the assessment; • You are current in the filing of all returns required to be filed; • You or your business are not currently involved in an open bankruptcy proceeding; • You are unlikely to be able to make payment within the statute of limitations (10 years)due to your financial situation; and • You either are without resources or unable to apply present and/or future resources to pay the outstanding tax liability.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Voluntary Disclosure Multistate Tax Commission (MTC) Program

Participates The District of Columbia participates in the Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program (MVDP) which allows taxpayers with outstanding tax liabilities in multiple states to negotiate settlements via a process coordinated by the National Nexus Program (NNP) staff of the MTC. Multistate Tax Commission, Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program. To participate in the MVDP, the taxpayer must:• have a minimum good-faith tax liability estimate of $500 or more; • not have been contacted by a state or commission regarding taxes due;and • submit a completed Voluntary Disclosure Agreement (VDA) including taxpayer's contact information, tax year, list of states to receive the proposed VDA, description of taxpayer's activities in each state, and estimate of taxes due. Multistate Tax Commission, Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program. The District of Columbia may have additional requirements for participation in the MVDP. The program is intended to incentivize taxpayers to begin filing and paying taxes in all of the states in which they have substantial nexus. Upon entering into a voluntary disclosure agreement with a state, taxpayers will be required to file returns, pay the tax due and accrued interest on the returns, and register with the state in exchange for waiver of penalties for the entire look-back period. Taxpayers are not charged to participate in the MVDP. Online Marketplace Seller Voluntary Disclosure Initiative – Special Multistate Tax Commission (MTC) Program From Aug. 17, 2017, through Nov. 1, 2017, the District of Columbia is participating in the MTC's special limited-time voluntary disclosure initiative in which back sales and use tax liability may be waived for eligible online marketplace sellers that timely register and begin to collect the state's sales and use tax.
