Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Food and Food Ingredients General Rule

Taxable Qualified sales of food by a qualified business are taxed at a reduced state rate of 1.225 percent plus any applicable local tax. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.020.1; Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-110.990(1). All other sales of food are taxed at the full state rate of 4.225 percent plus any applicable local tax. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.020.1; Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-110.990(1); Missouri Letter Ruling LR6428 (Aug. 27, 2010). Qualified food means food that qualifies under the Federal Food Stamp Program. This includes food or food products for home consumption and seeds and plants for use in gardens to produce foods for personal consumption. Food items refrigerated or at room temperature qualify for the reduced rate, even if the purchaser elects to heat the item on the business premises. Bakery items, even if still warm from baking, are qualified foods. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-110.990(2)(A). Sales of alcoholic beverages and tobacco do not qualify for the reduced rate. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-110.990(2)(A) In Gate Gourmet, Inc. v. Missouri Dir. of Rev., the Commission held the taxpayer, a global provider of catering and provisioning services for airlines and railroads, was correctly taxed under Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.020. The plain language of Mo. Rev. Stat. § 144.014(2) requires that to be taxed under that statute, the food must be “for home consumption.” Whether the same type of frozen dinner may be subject to 1 percent tax when sold for home consumption, but 4 percent tax when sold for consumption in commercial aircraft, is not a product of improper assessments, but of the language of § 144.014.2 itself as interpreted by the Supreme Court. Mo. Rev. Stat. § 144.014(2); Gate Gourmet, Inc. v. Missouri Dir. of Rev., 504 S.W.3d 59, 2016 BL 332900, (Mo., 2016) (the Supreme Court of Missouri affirmed the decision of the Administrative Hearing Commission holding that the question of whether the food qualifies for a reduced tax rate is not based where the food has the capacity to be eaten or where it is actually eaten but rather where the food was intended or expected to be eaten); see alsoGate Gourmet, Inc. v. Missouri Dir. of Rev., No. 13-2011 RS (Mo. Adm. Hearing Comm. Nov. 2, 2015) BNA-SUTN MO 11.1.1.

Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Food and Food Ingredients Definition of 'Food and Food Ingredients'

Defined Missouri defines food as only those products and types of food for which food stamps may be redeemed pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Food Stamp Program. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.014(2); see also 7 U.S.C. § 2012. Under 7 U.S.C. § 2012, food is defined as “any food or food product for home consumption . . . and seeds and plants for use in gardens to produce foods for personal consumption.” 7 U.S.C. § 2012. “Thus, the ‘products and types of food’ subject to the one percent state sales tax are food items for home consumption.” Wehrenberg Inc. v. Missouri Dir. of Rev., 352 S.W.3d 366, 2011 BL 257909 (Mo. 2011) (en banc). In general, foods that are not eligible for purchase with food stamps, and are therefore not eligible for the reduced rate of tax rate in Missouri are:• food products that contain alcohol or tobacco products; • items that are not intended for human consumption (e.g., paper products or pet foods); • foods sold hot at the point-of-sale; and • vitamins and supplements.

Missouri has also addressed the tax treatment of candy sold from vending machines in at least one letter ruling. In Missouri Letter Ruling LR3809 an amusement park operator requested to know if soft drinks and candy sold through its vending machines were subject to the reduced food sales tax rate. The ruling established that they were taxable at the low rate if the soft drinks and candy were the types of food items that could be purchased with food stamps.

The reduced rate for foods includes only those products and types of food for which food stamps may be redeemed. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.014.2. Food subject to the low rate of tax is determined in accordance with 7 U.S.C. § 2012, and the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture's eligible food items list includes only vitamins and supplements that carry a nutrition facts label. U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Determining Product Eligibility for Purchase with SNAP Benefits.; Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.014.2. Missouri has addressed the tax treatment of dietary supplements in at least one letter ruling. In Missouri Letter Ruling LR7673, a corporation sold vitamins and nutritional supplements, among other things. Some products contained nutrition facts labels, whereas others contained supplemental facts labels. The ruling first concluded that the sales of dietary supplements are subject to sales or use tax because they were not prescribed or subject to an over-the-counter drug product labeling requirement. Then, distinguishing between the two categories, the ruling concluded that the subset with the nutritional facts labels was taxable at the reduced tax rate for food, whereas the subset with the supplemental facts labels was instead taxable at the full tax rate.

Energy drinks do not appear on the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture list of foods that qualify for the federal food stamp program and therefore, do not qualify for the reduced state sales tax rate. These drinks are subject to the state sales tax rate of 4.225 percent plus the applicable local sales tax rate. One isotonics drink appears on the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture list of foods. However, the type of isotonic drink is necessary to make a determination of whether this drink is considered food, as some isotonics drinks may fall in the ineligible “energy” category.

Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Prepared Food General Rule

Taxable Sales of hot food items ready for immediate consumption do not qualify for the reduced sales tax rate and are subject to tax at the full rate. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-110.990(2)(A); see Shelter Mutual Ins. Co. v. Missouri Dir. of Rev., 107 S.W.3d 919 (Mo. 2003); see, e.g., Missouri Letter Ruling LR2910 (Mar. 16, 2006). Moreover, the full sales tax rate applies to charges for meals and drinks furnished at any hotel, motel, tavern, inn, restaurant, eating house, drugstore, dining car, tourist cabin, tourist camp, or other place in which rooms, meals, or drinks are regularly served to the public. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.020.1(6). Tax-exempt schools, charitable institutions, colleges and universities operating lunch rooms, cafeterias, dining rooms or any other facilities where meals are provided to students are not in the business of selling regularly to the public and are not subject to the sales tax. This exemption does not apply to food, drink and snacks sold at student unions and the like, where the items are equally available to and sold to the public. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-3.404; see also J.B. Vending Co. v. Missouri Dir. of Rev., 54 S.W. 3d 183, 187 (Mo. 2001) (the term “public”includes “a subset of the populace”). In Union Electric Co. d/b/a Ameren Missouri v. Missouri Dir. of Rev., the Missouri Supreme Court held that a bakery department of a grocery store does not constitute “bakeries”as used in an example of a regulation promulgated pursuant to the relevant statutory exemption. The taxpayer had sought a refund for sales tax paid on energy purchases, claiming that such food preparation fell under the exemption for electrical energy used in the “processing”of a product. The court rejected the taxpayer's argument and ruled that the term “processing” does not include the in-store final preparation of baked goods for retail sale. Union Electric Co. d/b/a Ameren Missouri v. Missouri Dir. of Rev., 425 S.W.3d 118 (Mo. 2014). The term “food” does not include food or beverages sold by an establishment where 80 percent of its total gross receipts derived from food prepared by such establishment is to be consumed at the place of preparation, or while commuting to, or immediately upon arrival at, another location without any further preparation. Under Mo. Rev. Stat. § 144.014.2, an establishment may charge the reduced food rate on its food sales if 20 percent or more of its gross receipts are from the sale of items other than food prepared for immediate consumption. Mo. Rev. Stat. § 144.014.2. In Krispy Kreme Doughnut Corp. v Director of Revenue, the Missouri Supreme Court held that the taxpayer failed to prove that sales of food prepared for immediate consumption did not constitute more than 80 percent of its total gross receipts under Mo. Rev. Stat. § 144.014. The taxpayer had sought a refund for sales tax paid between 2003 and 2005, contending that the 1 percent tax rate under Mo. Rev. Stat. § 144.014 was applicable to its sales of donuts, non-hot beverages, juices, milk, coffee beans, and ground coffee. The court rejected the taxpayer's argument and ruled that the taxpayer's stores operate more like restaurants than grocery stores, whose sales of donuts are intended to be taxed at the higher rate of 4 percent. Krispy Kreme Doughnut Corp. v Director of Revenue, No. SC95181 (Mo. May 5, 2016). Sales of Food and Beverages to and by Public Carriers In general, the sales of food and beverages to public carriers are subject to tax unless the carrier charges a separate amount for the sale of these items to its passengers or crew. A public carrier may issue a resale exemption certificate to a seller of food and beverages if the public carrier sells the food and beverages to its passengers or crew and charges them a separately stated amount for these items. If a public carrier chooses this option, it is subject to tax on the gross receipts from all sales in Missouri of food or beverages to passengers or crew. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-103.500. Local Taxation of Meals Generally Missouri law does authorize the imposition of local meals taxes, detailed below. In addition to these taxes, meals are also subject to the local sales and use tax because the local sales and use tax applies to the same base as the state sales and use tax, which does apply to meals. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-110.990(2)(A); Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-117.100.(1). For more information on local taxes see Missouri's Local Government Tax Guide.
