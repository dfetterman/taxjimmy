State: Wyoming



Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Real Property

Nontaxable Wyoming does not impose sales or use tax on real property. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-105(a)(iv)(F). “Real property”is defined as land and appurtenances, including structures affixed upon it. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-101(a)(v). In Wyoming, “tangible personal property”means all personal property that can be seen, weighed, measured, felt or touched, or that is in any other manner perceptible to the senses. “Tangible personal property” includes electricity, water, gas, steam and prewritten computer software, as well as controlled substances they are sold through a written prescription through a licensed practitioner. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-101(a)(ix). BNA-SUTN WY 28.1.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal General Rule for Classification

Four-part Test Fixtures are generally not subject to tax, as long as they are sufficiently attached to real property to be considered real property themselves. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-101(a)(v). The Wyoming definition for real property includes the test used by the state for determining when an article of tangible personal property becomes sufficiently attached to real property that it is considered real property itself. Evaluating the four criteria, an article is considered real property if:• it is buried or embedded; Wyo. Stat. §39-15-101(a)(v)(A). or • it is physically or constructively annexed to the real property; Wyo. Stat. §39-15-101(a)(v)(B). • it is adapted to the use of the real property; Wyo. Stat. §39-15-101(a)(v)(C). and • one can reasonably infer that the intent of the annexing party was to make the article a permanent part of the real property. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-101(a)(v)(D). In Wyoming Dept. of Rev. v. Hanover Compression LP, Hanover did not pay sales tax on the income derived from operating and maintaining compressor facilities because of the belief that the services were performed to real property. The compressor facilities were affixed to a concrete foundation. Wyoming Dept. of Rev. v. Hanover Compression LP, 196 P.3d 781 (Wyo. 2008). The Wyoming Supreme Court subsequently upheld the Board of Equalization's (Board) interpretation of Wyo. Stat. §39-15-101(a)(v), and the four criteria set forth therein. The Board interprets the statute to have two parts. The first sentence is the original definition of real property. The second sentence was added later and refers to an “article.” The legislative intent for adding the term “article”to the definition of real property was to identify two distinct types of property. The definition includes traditional land, appurtenances, and structures, and since 2008, “articles” are considered real property when the four requirements of Wyo. Stat. §39-15-101(a)(v) are met. The Court also defined the term “affixed” by using its ordinary meaning to conclude that the Board's interpretation was correct. “Affixed” means to attach physically or to attach in any way. The Court held that the second sentence of §39-15-101(a)(v) clearly identifies when an article becomes affixed and is then considered real property. Therefore, the Court held that the services performed on the compressor facilities were not subject to sales tax, because they were performed on real rather than personal property. Wyoming Dept. of Rev. v. Hanover Compression LP, 196 P.3d 781 (Wyo. 2008). BNA-SUTN WY 28.2.1.
