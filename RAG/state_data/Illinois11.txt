Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Sales Tax

Yes The Illinois sales and use tax system operates with four separate taxes, two of which operate as sales taxes and two of which operate as use taxes. See, e.g., 35 ILCS 120/14. Those four taxes are the:• Retailers'Occupation Tax; 35 ILCS 120/14. • Service Occupation Tax; 35 ILCS 115/1. • Use Tax; 35 ILCS 105/1. and • Service Use Tax. 35 ILCS 110/1. Retailers'Occupation Tax The retailers' occupation tax is imposed upon persons engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail. 35 ILCS 120/2. The use tax compliments the retailers'occupation tax by imposing a tax upon tangible personal property used in Illinois that was purchased at retail. 35 ILCS 105/3. To the extent a seller must remit the retailers' occupation tax, the seller is authorized to collect and retain from its customers the complementary use tax, thereby avoiding double taxation on the associated transactions. 35 ILCS 105/9; see also Illinois v. Buffalo Confectionery Co., 401 N.E.2d 546 (Ill. 1980). Service Occupation Tax The service occupation tax is an occupational tax and its complementary privilege tax is the service use tax. The taxes are applicable to tangible personal property transferred by a service person in connection with rendered services, as opposed to property sold and purchased at retail. The service occupation tax is imposed upon servicemen or service providers engaged in the business of selling services. Property transferred in connection with services is taxed, as opposed to taxing the services. The service use tax is imposed upon the privilege of using real or tangible personal property in Illinois that was received incident to a purchase of a service from a serviceman or service provider. 35 ILCS 115/3; 35 ILCS 110/3. See Illinois General Information Letter ST 17-0018-GIL (June 2, 2017) (service transactions not involving transfer of tangible personal property to customer not subject to tax). The Illinois tax system provides for one tax return and taxes are collected through the Illinois Department of Revenue. The Department of Revenue enforces all four taxes and also promulgates rules and regulations in connection with administration. 35 ILCS 105/12; 35 ILCS 110/12; 35 ILCS 115/12. A uniform statewide tax rate has been adopted, meaning that taxes are collected by the Department of Revenue and then allocated to local governmental subdivisions. This structure serves to include one tax base and to reduce the collection fee for retailers. P.A. 85-1135, Laws 1988. The authority of municipalities and counties to impose their own occupation and use taxes has been abolished, with a significant exception existing for home rule municipalities and counties. P.A. 85-1135, Laws 1988. Thus, any permitted local sales and use taxes “piggyback” on the state level tax. BNA-SUTN IL 1.1.1.

Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Use Tax

Yes Illinois imposes two versions of the use tax: a use tax , which serves as the complementary tax to the retailers' occupation tax, and the service use tax, which serves as the complementary tax to the service occupation tax. 35 ILCS 105/1 et seq.; 35 ILCS 110/1 et seq. General Use Tax Illinois imposes the use tax on the privilege of using tangible personal property purchased at retail from a retailer. 35 ILCS 105/3. However, if the seller of tangible personal property for use would not be taxable under the retailers' occupation tax, then the use tax also is not imposed. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §150.101(c). Use taxes were developed to prevent evasion of the sales tax on purchases made within a state, and to protect the local retail merchant against diversion of his business to out-of-state sellers. Turner v. Wright, 142 N.E.2d 84 (Ill. 1957). The interrelation between the retailers'occupation tax and the use tax removes the advantage that might exist in making purchases outside Illinois by treating all purchases made at retail equally. Only purchasers of tangible personal property are liable for the use tax. The tax does not apply to the use of self-produced tangible personal property or property acquired as a gift. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §150.305(a). Although a producer is not taxed on the finished product that is self-consumed in Illinois, a producer is taxable on the purchase price of tangible personal property that he purchases at retail and then incorporates into the finished product. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §150.305(b). Although the recipient of a gift is not taxed on the transfer, the donor is liable for the use tax when he purchases property and gives it away. The transfer is considered a taxable use of the property. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §150.305(c). The limitation on the imposition of the use tax also applies to the use of property purchased from a seller when such sale may be characterized as isolated or occasional, because such a seller is deemed not to be engaged in the business of selling at retail with respect to those goods. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §150.305(d). Thus, if the seller qualified under the exception for isolated or occasional sales, then it would be liable neither for the retailers' occupation tax nor the use tax. This is so because the use tax is complementary to the retailers' occupation tax. 35 ILCS 105/3-65; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §150.101(d). The use tax also does not apply to rental payments made by a lessee to a lessor, although the lessor is legally the user of the property and so must submit the use tax on the purchase price thereof. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §150.305(e). An unusual feature of the Illinois use tax that distinguishes it from use taxes in other states is that it is imposed upon purchases for use made inside Illinois, as well as those made outside Illinois. 35 ILCS 105/10. To the extent a seller must remit the retailers' occupation tax, he is authorized to collect and retain from his customers the complementary use tax. He is permitted to retain it, because the State of Illinois has already collected its tax on the sale, and to demand the seller remit the use tax as well would result in double taxation. 35 ILCS 105/9; see also Illinois v. Buffalo Confectionery Co., 401 N.E.2d 546 (Ill. 1980). The delivery of any property to a user residing or doing business in Illinois shall be prima facie evidence that such property was sold for use in the state. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §160.101(b). However, the prima facie evidence may be rebutted by producing evidence showing that the property was never used in Illinois. Illinois Administrative Hearing UT 14-02 (May 15, 2014). For example, the Illinois Department of Revenue attempted to impose use tax on a watercraft that was purchased in Florida and allegedly transported to Illinois. The taxpayer successfully rebutted the state's prima facie case by showing evidence that the 25-foot tall boat was too tall to be transported on roads and could not have sailed to Illinois at the time the state asserted it entered the state, because the waterways were frozen, which would have destroyed the fiberglass boat. Illinois Administrative Hearing UT 14-02 (May 15, 2014). The use tax is distinguished from the Aircraft Use Tax, Watercraft Use Tax, and Vehicle Use Tax, as these other use taxes apply whenever there is a gift, transfer, or purchase of the respective property types. The use tax on the other hand only applies to items purchased at retail. Illinois Administrative Hearing UT 15-01 (Sept. 30, 2014). Service Use Tax The service use tax is imposed upon the privilege of using real or tangible personal property in Illinois that is acquired in connection with the purchase of a service from a serviceman. 35 ILCS 110/3. If the serviceman's sale of service would not have been subject to the service occupation tax, it will also not be subject to the complementary service use tax, despite the fact that all elements of the sale of service take place in Illinois. 35 ILCS 110/3-55. Evidence of the sale for delivery of any property to a user residing or doing business in Illinois shall be prima facie evidence that such property was sold for use in the state. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §160.101(b). The date of the purchase of a service is deemed to be the date of delivery, to the user, of the tangible personal property which is transferred incident to the sale of service. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §160.101(e). As a general rule, any tangible personal property transferred to a user incident to the purchase of a service is taxable under the Service Use Tax Act. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §160.110(a). As with the use tax, the service use tax is imposed upon the user of real or tangible personal property acquired incident to the purchase of a service from a serviceman. The user bears the ultimate responsibility for the tax and therefore if the service use tax is not paid directly to the serviceman (as would be the case if the user acquired the property outside Illinois), the user must instead remit the tax directly to the department. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §160.125(a). As a general rule, any tangible personal property transferred to a user incident to the purchase of a service is taxable under the Service Use Tax. However, there are exceptions to this rule. The Service Use Tax does not apply to: • the use in Illinois of property acquired elsewhere by a nonresident individual for his personal use while temporarily within Illinois or while merely passing through; • the use of property acquired outside Illinois which is later brought to Illinois for use in the state, but on which a use tax has already been remitted in another state; and • the temporary storage in Illinois of property which is acquired elsewhere and which will be used solely outside the state or incorporated into or physically attached to property that is used solely outside Illinois, or that is altered by converting, fabricating, manufacturing, printing, processing or shaping, and, as altered, is used outside Illinois. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 160.110(a); see Illinois General Information Letter ST 16-0049-GIL (Sept. 28, 2016). In addition, the Service Use Tax does not apply to the use of property purchased outside Illinois by a nonresident individual that the individual uses for a minimum of three months elsewhere before bringing the property to Illinois for use in the state. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 160.110(c). Similarly, a business that moves into Illinois after operating in another state and brings with it property used in another state in connection with that business for a minimum of three months is not subject to the Service Use Tax on that property. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 160.110(d). BNA-SUTN IL 1.1.2.

Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Local Option Sales and Use Tax

Local Tax Authorized Illinois imposes local sales and use tax which mirrors its state structure. See, e.g.,35 ILCS 636/5-5. With a few exceptions, the local sales and use tax structures mirror that of the state structure. In 1988, Illinois enacted sales tax reform legislation (which went into effect in 1990) that aimed to streamline the existing hodgepodge of sales taxation at the county and municipal levels. See, e.g.,35 ILCS 636/5-5; Illinois General Information Letter ST 17-0002-GIL (Jan. 19, 2017). The new system called for a single tax collector—the State of Illinois through the department—for both state and local taxes, except for those local taxes imposed by municipalities with populations of 500,000 or more, which would continue to be collected by their respective municipalities; a single tax rate on general merchandise to be shared by all taxing jurisdictions; a single base for both state and local taxes; and a uniform discount for those retailers who collect state and local taxes. See, e.g.,35 ILCS 636/5-5. Thus, except as to rate, all local sales and use taxes “piggyback” on the state level tax. The following local taxes may be imposed:• home rule municipal retailers' occupation tax and service occupation tax; • home rule county retailers' occupation tax and service occupation tax; • home rule municipal and home rule county use tax on property titled or registered with a state agency; • use tax in home rule municipalities with two million or more inhabitants on property that is not titled or registered with a state agency and that was purchased at retail from a retail location outside the corporate limits of the municipality; • home rule municipal soft drink retailers' occupation tax and fountain soft drink tax in municipalities with populations in excess of 1 million; • non-home rule municipal retailers' occupation tax, service occupation tax, and use tax on property titled or registered with a state agency, in cities with a population of more than 130,000 but less than 2 million; • non-home rule county retailer's occupation tax and service occupation tax; • Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority retailer's occupation tax on gross receipts from the sale of food, alcoholic beverages, and soft drinks; • Regional Transportation Authority retailers' occupation tax, service occupation tax, and use tax on property titled or registered with a state agency; • municipality development and redevelopment business districts retailer's occupation tax and service occupation tax; • Metro-East Mass Transit District retailers' occupation tax, service occupation tax, and use tax on property titled or registered with a state agency; • Metro-East Park and Recreation District retailer's occupation and service occupation tax; • county school facility retailer's occupation tax and service occupation tax for school facility purposes; • county water commission retailers' occupation tax, service occupation tax, and use tax on property titled or registered with a state agency; • county retailers' occupation tax and service occupation tax for public safety, public facility, or transportation purposes. Ill. Const. art. VII, § 6; 65 ILCS 5/8-11-1; 65 ILCS 5/8-11-1.1; 65 ILCS 5/8-11-6b; see Illinois Informational Bulletin FY 2017-16 (May 2017). Sales and use tax is collected from the purchaser by a retailer maintaining a place of business in the state of Illinois or a retailer authorized by the Illinois Department of Revenue. 35 ILCS 105/3-45. BNA-SUTN IL 1.1.3.

Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Excise and Replacement Taxes

Yes Excise Taxes Illinois imposes several excise taxes which operate both independently of, and in conjunction with its sale and use taxes depending upon the tax. See, e.g., Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2060(a). Illinois' excise taxes include: • an alcoholic beverage tax; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2060(a). • a cigarette and tobacco tax; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2060(d). • a motor fuel tax; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.2060(b). • an underground storage tank tax; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.435(c). and • several gaming taxes, such as a coin-operated amusement devise tax, 35 ILCS 510/1 et seq.; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §460.101. a bingo tax, 230 ILCS 25/1. and a charitable game tax. 230 ILCS 30/9. Replacement Taxes The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement prohibits member states from imposing a “prohibited replacement tax” which is a tax outside of the sales and use tax that is imposed on products defined in the Agreement. Generally, the Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board will make a finding regarding whether or not a member state has imposed a replacement tax. Illinois is not a member of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement. Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, State Info; Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement as amended through Dec. 16, 2016.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Historical Information

Est. 1933 Illinois first passed its Retailer's Occupation Tax in 1933 after a previous law was held unconstitutional on the grounds that exemption classifications violated the uniformity requirements of the Illinois Constitution. Illinois Gen. Assembly, Retailer's Occupation Tax Act. The current act was upheld as constitutional by the Illinois Supreme Court in the case of Reif v. Barrett. Chicago Metro. Agency for Planning, History of State/Local Revenue Sharing in Illinois; Winter v. Barrett, 352 Ill. 441, 186 N.E. 113 (Ill. 1933); Reif v. Barrett, 355 Ill. 104, 188 N.E. 889 (Ill. 1933).

Topic: Imposition of Tax Pending and Trending Developments

Cloud Computing/Economic Nexus Cloud Computing The Illinois Department of Revenue has offered initial guidance on the taxability of cloud computing transactions. Illinois General Information Letter ST 17-0007-GIL (March 2, 2017). The department clarified that software provided through a cloud-based delivery system is currently not subject to tax. These arrangements are under review by the department, and if it determines that such transactions are in fact taxable, that determination will only be applied prospectively. Illinois General Information Letter ST 17-0007-GIL (March 2, 2017). Previously, the department has declined to provide clear guidance on the issue of cloud computing in general information letters. Further, Illinois has not adopted legislation or regulations specifically addressing cloud computing services. See, e.g., Illinois General Information Letter ST 13-0049-GIL (Sept. 11, 2013); Illinois General Information Letter ST 12-0002-GIL (Jan. 6, 2012); Illinois General Information Letter ST 10-0113-GIL (Dec. 14, 2010); Illinois General Information Letter ST 10-0062-GIL (Aug. 4, 2010). For more information on cloud computing transactions, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Illinois 19.9 and 1380-1st T.M., Sales and Use Taxes: Cloud Computing, at 1380.05. Economic Nexus Effective Oct. 1, 2018, Illinois considers out-of-state retailers and “servicemen”who make $100,000 in sales or deliver 200 transactions into the state in a year to be maintaining a place of business in the state. 35 ILCS 105/2(9) and 35 ILCS 110/2(9), both added by 2018 Ill. H.B. 3342, effective Oct. 1, 2018; Illinois Informational Bulletin FY 2019-05 (Aug. 2018). The U.S. Supreme Court held in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., 138 S. Ct. 2080, 2018 BL 219995 (U.S. 2018). that the physical presence requirement articulated in Quill Corp. v. North Dakota Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 298 (1992), overruled in part by South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., 138 S. Ct. 2080, 2018 BL 219995 (U.S. 2018). is no longer a bar to imposing sales tax collection requirements on out-of-state retailers, thus paving the way for states to begin enforcing economic nexus regimes. The Illinois Department of Revenue has issued guidance regarding implementation of the state's economic nexus statute in the aftermath of the Wayfair decision.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Sale' and 'Retail Sale'

Defined In Illinois, the sales and use tax system operates with four separate taxes, two of which operate as sales taxes and two of which operate as use taxes. See, e.g., 35 ILCS 105/3. Therefore, Illinois contains two definitions of “sale”: one for a “sale at retail,” Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.201(a)(1); Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §140.201(e). and one for “sale of service.” Ill. Admin. Code, tit. 86 § 140.201(f). Imposition of the Retailers' Occupation Tax The retailers' occupation tax is imposed upon persons engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail; the tax is measured as a percentage of the gross receipts received from sales. 35 ILCS 120/2; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.101. A “sale at retail”means any transfer for consideration of the ownership or title to tangible personal property to a purchaser for use or consumption. A “sale at retail” does not include transfers for resale. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.201(a)(1). Sales Distinguished from Services Only sales of tangible personal property at retail, not sales of services, are subject to the retailers' occupation tax. The act does not prescribe guidelines for determining whether a businessperson is engaged primarily in providing services or in selling tangible personal property at retail, but a body of case law has emerged to help clarify the situation. Generally, if the article sold is specially crafted for a particular purchaser and would have little or no commercial value otherwise except as scrap; or if the completed article is of trifling material value and the bulk of the cost represents almost entirely expert service; or if the transfer of the article to the purchaser is simply a necessary part of rendering the service, then the person is engaged in providing a service. On the other hand, if the transfer of the property is the substance of the transaction and the service rendered is merely incidental to, and an inseparable part of, the transfer, then the person is engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail. Characterization of a person's business (i.e., whether it is a service or retail business) requires one to consider the facts and circumstances of each individual case in their entirety. Ingersoll Milling Machine Co. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 405 Ill. 367 (1950). However, taxability is not determined by what the customer ultimately does with the article and such considerations are useful only insofar as they shed light on the primary occupation of the seller. Sterling Steel Casting Co. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 7 Ill. 2d 244, 130 N.E.2d 262 (Ill. 1955). “If the article sold is the substance of the transaction and the service rendered merely incidental to and an inseparable part of the transfer to the purchaser of the article sold, then the vendor is engaged in the business of selling at retail, and the tax which he pays for the privilege of engaging in such business is measured by the price which the purchaser pays for the article and the service incident thereto.” Snite v. Illinois of Dept. of Rev., 398 Ill. 41, 46, 74 N.E.2d 877 (Ill. 1947). The taxpayer operated a bar and restaurant on the premises of the Elmhurst Country Club for the purpose of selling food and drink to its members. The taxpayer's argument was that because the club was organized for social and not commercial purposes, it must follow that his purpose in operating the club must necessarily be social and not commercial. The court, pointing out that the tax is imposed not on the sales themselves but on the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, rejected the taxpayer's contention on the grounds that the club is a separate and distinct entity from the taxpayer himself and that because all of the profits and losses incurred to the taxpayer, he must be engaged in the business of selling at retail and hence subject to liability for the tax. Imposition of Service Occupation Tax The service occupation tax is imposed on service providers for tangible property transferred in connection with a sale of services by persons engaged in the business of making sales of service. A person engaged in such a business is referred to as a serviceman. 35 ILCS 115/3; Illinois Private Letter Ruling ST 15-0048-GIL (July 27, 2015) (the activity of printing and distributing door hangers was a service transaction that may result in the taxpayers obligation to collect service use tax or remit use tax). Under the service occupation tax, servicemen can calculate their tax base in one of four ways. See Ill. Admin. Code, tit. 86 § 140.106(a)(1) (first method); Ill. Admin. Code, tit. 86 § 140.106(a)(2) (second method); Ill. Admin. Code, tit. 86 § 140.109 (third method); Ill. Admin. Code, tit. 86 § 140.108 (fourth method); see, e.g., Illinois Private Letter Ruling ST 15-0011-GIL (July 16, 2015) (explaining the four service occupation tax calculation methods in response to an inquiry from a company that has a multi-service situation involving a direct mail marketing campaign; Illinois General Information Letter ST 15-0012-GIL (Jan. 30, 2015) (explaining the four service occupation tax calculation methods in response to an inquiry from a company that contracts with medical facilities to release medical records to third parties); Illinois General Information Letter ST 12-0015-GIL (Jan. 25, 2012). Those calculation methods include:• Method 1: separately stating the selling price of tangible personal property transferred incident to the service; Ill. Admin. Code, tit. 86 § 140.106(a)(1). • Method 2: calculating 50 percent of the serviceman's entire bill; Ill. Admin. Code, tit. 86 § 140.106(a)(2). • Method 3: calculating service occupation tax on the serviceman's cost price if the serviceman is a registered de minimis serviceman; Ill. Admin. Code, tit. 86 § 140.109. or • Method 4: calculating use tax on the serviceman's cost price if the serviceman is de minimis and is not otherwise required to be registered for the Retailer's Occupation Tax. Ill. Admin. Code, tit. 86 § 140.108. What is Taxed? Tangible personal property that is transferred to the purchaser incident to the sale of a service is subject to the service occupation tax. Tangible personal property transferred incident to the completion of a maintenance agreement is exempt from the tax. 35 ILCS 115/2. Sale of Service Defined “Sale of service” means any transaction except for a retail sale of tangible personal property that is taxable under the retailers' occupation tax or use tax, a sale for the purpose of resale, or any specifically exempted transfer. Ill. Admin. Code, tit. 86 § 140.201(f). Whether a taxpayer is deemed to be engaged in a service enterprise as opposed to selling at retail requires consideration of three factors:• the ratio between the bare cost of materials and the ultimate sales price; • the buyer's motivation in choosing a particular seller; and • whether the item at issue is a unique or special order item. Colorcraft Corp. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 112 Ill. 2d 473, 493 N.E.2d 1066 (Ill. 1986). The tax is to be paid to the department by any serviceman who transfers tangible personal property as incident to a sale of service. As with the retailers' occupation tax, the serviceman may reimburse himself to the extent he is liable for the service occupation tax by collecting the service use tax from his customers. However, if the serviceman collects an amount that purports to reimburse him for service occupation tax liability measured by receipts or selling prices that are not subject to the service occupation tax, or if any serviceman collects more from the purchaser than the serviceman's service occupation tax liability on the transaction, the purchaser has a legal right to claim a refund in that amount from the serviceman. If for any reason the serviceman is unable to refund that amount, the serviceman is liable to pay that amount to the department. If the serviceman has already paid the service occupation tax to his supplier on the cost price of the goods purchased, he is allowed to then take a credit against his service occupation tax liability based on the selling price of that property transferred in the course of providing a service. 35 ILCS 115/3-40. Multi-Service Situation A multi-service situation is where a primary serviceman contracts some portion of the work to a subcontractor. The primary serviceman's cost price is determined by either the separately stated price of tangible personal property transferred from the secondary serviceman, or if the price is not separately stated, 50 percent of the total cost. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §140.145; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §140.301(a). If both servicemen are registered, the primary serviceman may provide a certificate of resale to the secondary serviceman, and the primary serviceman would then incur Service Occupation Tax.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Lease'

Not Defined Illinois provides rules and regulations on the taxability of leases but does not specially define the term “lease.” See, e.g., 35 ILCS 120/2-5(25). However, the Illinois Department of Revenue has described lease types. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 130.2010; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 130.2011; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, § 130.2012; Ill. Admin.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Use' or 'Storage, Use, or Consumption'

Defined The term “use” is defined expressly to mean the “exercise by any person of any right or power over tangible personal property incident to the ownership of that property, except that it does not include the sale of the property in any form as tangible personal property in the regular course of business to the extent that the property is not first subjected to a use for which it was purchased.” Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §150.201. “Use,” in this context, is the exercise of any right or power over tangible personal property incident to the ownership of the property. The term “use”does not mean that a person actually uses the tangible personal property, just that he or she has the property in Illinois and exerts a right or power over the tangible personal property. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §150.201; see also Illinois Administrative Hearing UT 13-06 (Aug. 6, 2013). Collection Although the user bears the ultimate burden for submitting the use tax, a retailer may be required or authorized by the department to collect the use tax from purchasers who are purchasing tangible personal property for use or consumption. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §150.130(a). If the retailer fails to collect the tax, this does not prevent the department from collecting the tax directly from the purchaser. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §150.130(a). Before remitting the use tax collected on behalf of the department, the retailer may reduce it by the amount of the retailers' occupation tax imposed upon the retailer on the same sale. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §150.130(b). The Use Tax Act relieves Illinois retailers who collect use tax on a transaction from paying the retailer's occupation tax. United Air Lines Inc. v. Johnson, 419 N.E.2d 899 (Ill. 1981). When collecting use tax, the Illinois Use Tax Act provides that a retailer states the use tax amount “as a distinct item separate and apart from the selling price.” 35 ILCS 105/3a. For practical purposes, this means that retailers should prove compliance by showing the tax separately on invoices that are issued to customers. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §150.1305(b). If a retailer fails to prove compliance, it loses the benefit of taking a deduction on its retailer's occupation tax return for the use taxes collected. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §150.1315; see also Saco Industries Inc. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 702 N.E.2d 1012 (Ill. App. 1998). BNA-SUTN IL 1.4.3.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Tangible Personal Property'

Not Defined The Retailers' Occupation Tax Act does not expressly define the term “tangible personal property.” 35 ILCS 120/1; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §130.101. Courts in Illinois have interpreted tangible personal property to mean “corporeal property either real or personal.” Farrand Coal Co. v. Halpin, 10 Ill. 2d 507, 140 N.E.2d 698 (Ill. 1957); see also Exelon Corp. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 234 Ill. 2d 266, 917 N.E.2d 899 (Ill. 2009) (holding under this definition that electricity constitutes tangible personal property), 559 U.S. 972 (2010), cert. denied. Illinois defines the term “corporeal”as “of the nature of, consisting of, or pertaining to, matter or a material body; physical; bodily; material—opposed to spiritual or immaterial . . . tangible or palpable.” Farrand Coal Co. v. Halpin, 10 Ill. 2d 507, 140 N.E.2d 698 (Ill. 1957); see also Exelon Corp. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 234 Ill. 2d 266, 917 N.E.2d 899 (Ill. 2009) (holding under this definition that electricity constitutes tangible personal property), 559 U.S. 972 (2010), cert. denied. Applying this definition, the court reasoned that because energy cannot be separated from mass or matter and perceived by the senses in its own right, or located spatially because it does not have dimensions, it falls short of fitting within the ordinary and popularly understood meaning of the word “tangible.” Farrand Coal Co. v. Halpin, 10 Ill. 2d 507, 140 N.E.2d 698 (Ill. 1957) Since 1988, tangible personal property includes computer software and certain products of photo processing, but excludes products of photo processing produced for use in motion pictures for public commercial exhibition. 35 ILCS 105/3; 35 ILCS 120/2. BNA-SUTN IL 1.4.4.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Intangible Property'

Not Defined Illinois has not defined “intangible property.” However, it does distinguish tangible property from intangible property by considering the “essence of the transaction,” or application of the true object test. First Natl. Bank of Springfield v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 85 Ill. 2d 84, 421 N.E.2d 175 (Ill. 1981). In First Nat'l. Bank of Springfield v. IIl. Dep't. of Revenue, the property in dispute was computer software that was contained on magnetic tapes;the court held that the essence of the transaction was not the tapes themselves, but rather the information contained on them. The court distinguished the tapes from media such as films or books, which although similar to the magnetic tapes in the sense that they physically represent the transfer of ideas or artistic processes, are inseparable from the media on which they are stored; those media are the only ways of preserving the information. By contrast, the computer software was capable of being stored on a number of different media, hence it was separable and the essence of the transaction was the acquisition of the information itself, rather than the actual, physical tapes. First Natl. Bank of Springfield v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 85 Ill. 2d 84, 421 N.E.2d 175 (Ill. 1981). In a general information letter, the Illinois Department of Revenue has stated that sales of block-chain “utility tokens” representing an ownership interest in cryptocurrency mining hardware are not subject to tax, as they are sales of intangible personal property. Illinois General Information Letter ST 18-0025-GIL (Sept. 13, 2018). BNA-SUTN IL 1.4.5.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Retailer' or 'Vendor'

Defined In Illinois, the sales and use tax system operates with four separate taxes, two of which operate as sales taxes and two of which operate as use taxes. See, e.g., 35 ILCS 105/3. Therefore, Illinois contains two definitions pertinent to defining a retailer or vendor: “retailer” Ingersoll Milling Machine Co. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 405 Ill. 367 (1950). and “serviceman.” Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §140.120. Retailer Defined In Illinois, a “retailer"means and includes every person engaged in the business of making sales at retail and every person engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property for use, and not for resale in any form. 35 ILCS 105/2; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §150.201. A person who holds himself or herself out as being engaged (or who habitually engages) in selling tangible personal property at retail is a retailer with respect to such sales(and not primarily in a service occupation) notwithstanding the fact that such person designs and produces such tangible personal property on special order for the purchaser and in such a way as to render the property of value only to such purchaser, if such tangible personal property produced on special order serves substantially the same function as stock or standard items of tangible personal property that are sold at retail. 35 ILCS 105/2; Ingersoll Milling Machine Co. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 405 Ill. 367 (1950). A seller who holds himself out as making retail sales, or who habitually makes such sales, is a person who sells at retail as defined by the statute. The legal incidence of the tax is on the retailer, who is responsible for remitting it to the state. In contrast to many other states, the Illinois retailer does not pass the tax through to consumers. However, to the extent the retailer is liable for the retailers' occupation tax, he may reimburse himself by collecting the use tax from his customers. 35 ILCS 105/2. A person whose activities are organized and conducted primarily as a not-for-profit service enterprise, and who engages in selling tangible personal property at retail (whether to the public or merely to members and their guests) is a retailer with respect to such transactions, excepting only a person organized and operated exclusively for charitable, religious or educational purposes either to the extent of sales by such person: (1) to its members, students, patients or inmates of tangible personal property to be used primarily for the purposes of such person; or (2) of tangible personal property which is not sold or offered for sale by persons organized for profit. 35 ILCS 105/2. A person is not a “retailer” by making the isolated or occasional sale of tangible personal property at retail if the person does not hold himself out as being engaged(or does not habitually engage) in selling such tangible personal property at retail or a sale through a bulk vending machine. However, any person who is engaged in a business which is not subject to the tax imposed by the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act because of involving the sale of or a contract to sell real estate or a construction contract to improve real estate, but who, in the course of conducting such business, transfers tangible personal property to users or consumers in the finished form in which it was purchased, and which does not become real estate, under any provision of a construction contract or real estate sale or real estate sales agreement entered into with some other person arising out of or because of such nontaxable business, is a retailer to the extent of the value of the tangible personal property so transferred. 35 ILCS 105/2. Because the Retailers' Occupation Tax applies only to those sales made at retail, any person not engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property at retail are not required to remit the tax. In Dearborn Wholesale Grocers Inc. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., the Illinois Supreme Court faced the question of the applicability of the resale certification requirements to wholesalers. Dearborn Wholesale Grocers Inc. v. Whitler, 82 Ill. 2d 471, 413 N.E.2d 370 (Ill. 1980). The department contended that the taxpayer's evidence, mostly in the form of testimony from its employees and purchasers, was insufficient to override the department's prima facie case. Dearborn Wholesale Grocers Inc. v. Whitler, 82 Ill. 2d 471, 473-74 413 N.E.2d 370 (Ill. 1980). The department cited section 2c of the Retailers' Occupation Tax which provides that a purchaser asserting that he is making purchases for later resale must apply to the department for a resale number, and that proof of such a number is necessary to rebut the presumption that a sale is at retail. Dearborn Wholesale Grocers Inc. v. Whitler, 82 Ill. 2d 471, 474, 413 N.E.2d 370 (Ill. 1980). The court concluded that because the Retailers'Occupation Tax is imposed upon the business of selling tangible personal property at retail and not on the property itself, section 2c and the other amendments to the Act cannot possibly be applicable to the taxpayer in the case because the taxpayer had established the fact that it was a wholesaler, not a retailer. Dearborn Wholesale Grocers Inc. v. Whitler, 82 Ill. 2d 471, 475 413 N.E.2d 370 (Ill. 1980). “The apparent purpose of section 2c is … to provide a means of verifying a claim made by a person subject to the Act as a retailer that a particular sale by him is exempt from tax because the purchaser is not himself the ultimate user or consumer of the property.” Dearborn Wholesale Grocers Inc. v. Whitler, 82 Ill. 2d 471, 413 N.E.2d 370 (Ill. 1980). Cf. Illinois General Information Letter ST 17-0001-GIL (Jan. 10, 2017) (motor vehicle manufacturer that makes sales of its cars exclusively for resale and that makes sales of other tangible personal property for which it files and reports tax is not considered a retailer and thus is not subject to the $100 penalty for not filing zero liability transaction reporting returns with respect to the motor vehicle sales for resale). A seller who makes only a very small percentage of sales at retail while the rest are for wholesale is likewise not responsible for remitting the tax under the Act or its various amendments. In Illinois Cereal Mills Inc. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., the taxpayer was engaged principally in the manufacture of corn products which were then sold to other manufacturers to be processed and resold primarily as livestock feed. Ill. Cereal Mills, Inc. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 457 N.E.2d 385, 99 Ill. 2d 9, 75 Ill. Dec. 391 (Ill. 1983). The taxpayer presented testimony from officers, employees and purchasers that the bulk of its sales were for resale, and that the tiny fraction that were not were principally accommodation sales made for goodwill purposes. Ill. Cereal Mills, Inc. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 457 N.E.2d 385, 99 Ill. 2d 9, 75 Ill. Dec. 391 (Ill. 1983). The court held that Dearborn was controlling in the case because only a minute portion of the taxpayer's total sales were made at retail. Ill. Cereal Mills, Inc. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 457 N.E.2d 385, 99 Ill. 2d 9, 75 Ill. Dec. 391 (Ill. 1983). It could not, then, realistically be said that the taxpayer was engaged in the business of selling at retail when greater than 99 percent of its gross receipts came from non-retail sales. Ill. Cereal Mills, Inc. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 457 N.E.2d 385, 99 Ill. 2d 9, 75 Ill. Dec. 391 (Ill. 1983). In the absence of compliance with section 2c and the other relevant amendments to the Retailers' Occupation Tax, retail sales made by a taxpayer who claims the resale exemption must be infrequent and must constitute a small percentage (typically less than one percent) of the gross receipts. In Tri-America Oil Co. v. Department of Revenue, the taxpayer was engaged in both the retail and wholesale sale of gasoline. Tri-America Oil Co. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 102 Ill. 2d 234, 464 N.E.2d 1076 (Ill. 1984). The taxpayer failed to obtain a resale certificate from one of its lessees. The taxpayer argued that a resale certificate was not required under the circumstances because the propositions articulated in Dearborn and Illinois Cereal extended to his own activities. Tri-America Oil Co. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 102 Ill. 2d 234, 235 464 N.E.2d 1076 (Ill. 1984). The court rejected this notion because the taxpayer regularly operated three gasoline stations which made sales regularly to the public at retail, in addition to the fact that the sales to the lessee were neither infrequent nor insignificant in amount. Tri-America Oil Co. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 102 Ill. 2d 234, 464 N.E.2d 1076 (Ill. 1984). Similarly, in Elkay Manufacturing Co. v. Sweet, the court held that a seller who makes exclusively retail sales or who makes some sales at resale and some for use and consumption must obtain a resale certificate from the purchaser in order to rely on the exemption. Elkay Manufacturing Co. v. Sweet, 202 Ill.App. 3d 466, 559 N.E.2d 1058 (Ill. App. Ct. 1990). Other documentation is insufficient to establish the sales are for resale. Elkay Manufacturing Co. v. Sweet, 202 Ill.App. 3d 466, 473 559 N.E.2d 1058 (Ill. App. Ct. 1990). Effective Oct. 1, 1974, a person who is the recipient of a grant or contract under Title VII of the Older Americans Act of 1965 and serves meals to participants in the Federal Nutrition Program for the Elderly in return for contributions established in amount by the individual participant pursuant to a schedule of suggested fees as provided for in the Federal Act is not a retailer under the Illinois Use Tax Act with respect to such transactions. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §150.201. A taxpayer may not overcome the department's presumption that he is a retailer merely by making some oral assertion to that effect. Once evidence has been established that a taxpayer makes retail sales in general, the taxpayer will then have the burden of proving that the sales were in fact for resale or for some other reason were nontaxable transactions. Danny J. Pedigo d/b/a Pedigo Sod Co. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 105 Ill. App.3d 759, 434 N.E.2d 860 (Ill. App. Ct. 1982). The same standards for Departmental presumption of correctness will apply if the taxpayer is seeking to deny nexus as a way of avoiding the retailer's use tax liability. Illinois Administrative Hearing ST 13-01 (Jan. 15, 2013). If the taxpayer believes that certain sales should be characterized as nontaxable, then he has the burden of proving such characterization by providing the department with books and records documenting his assertion. Danny J. Pedigo d/b/a Pedigo Sod Co. v. Illinois Dept. of Rev., 105 Ill. App.3d 759, 434 N.E.2d 860 (Ill. App. Ct. 1982); see, e.g., Illinois Administrative Hearing ST 16-04 (Jan. 21, 2016) (finding that a banquet hall underreported receipts and lacked sufficient books and records regarding banquet event mandatory gratuities, banquet event “extras,” and cancellation fees). All sales of tangible personal property should be assumed to be taxable unless proof exists to the contrary. A construction contractor or real estate developer is a retailer under Illinois' Use Tax Act to the same extent to which he is a retailer under the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §150.201. Serviceman Defined In Illinois, a “serviceman"means any person who is engaged in the occupation of making sales of service. 35 ILCS 110/2; 35 ILCS 115/2; Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §140.201(h). Additionally, any person who transfers property as an incident to a sale of service is a “serviceman”as defined by the Service Occupation Tax Act. The definition of “serviceman”includes a person who repairs tangible personal property for a user. Ill. Admin. Code tit. 86, §140.120. BNA-SUTN IL 1.4.6.
