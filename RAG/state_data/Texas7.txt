Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Restaurant Equipment

Exempt Texas considers restaurants that prepare food for consumption by customers to be manufacturers for sales and use tax purposes because some of their activities constitute processing.

Specifically, processing equipment that directly makes a physical or chemical change to the food held for sale is exempt from sales and use tax. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing Nos. 112,918 (Nov. 2, 2016). Additionally, tangible personal property used or consumed in the actual manufacturing, processing, or fabrication of food for ultimate sale is exempt if the use or consumption of the property is necessary and essential to comply with federal, state, or local laws or rules that establish requirements related to public health.

Items that are used to warm, cool, freeze, serve, or display food include coffee pots, tea carafes, and fajita skillets if used to serve.

Dual purpose items, such as paper towels, hand soaps, floor cleaner, stainless steel cleaner, degreaser, dish detergent, bleach, gloves, foil, film, waxed paper, thermometers, and skillets, are subject to tax depending on the manner in which such items are used.

With dual purpose items, such as paper towels, a restaurant must keep clear and convincing records regarding use in a manner that qualifies for exemption. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing Nos. 112,918 (Nov. 2, 2016) (where auditor confirms on a tour of taxpayer's premises that paper towels are used in kitchen and bathroom, the taxpayer has failed to provide and convincing evidence that the paper towels and other related items are exempt).
