Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Tax Collection and Remittance

Vendor The Comptroller requires the seller/vendor to collect sales and use tax from all applicable purchases and to remit the tax to the Comptroller of Maryland. Md. Code Ann. Tax-Gen. §11-401(a); Md. Code Ann. Tax-Gen. §11-403(b), as amended by 2019 Md. H.B. 884, effective June 1, 2019. Effective Oct. 1, 2019, the definition of vendor will include those who are engaged in the business of a marketplace facilitator or a marketplace seller. As such, a marketplace facilitator is responsible for collecting and remitting the sales and use tax due on an applicable sale by a marketplace seller. A marketplace seller is required to collect and remit sales and use tax only to the extent that a marketplace facilitator does not. Md. Code Ann. Tax-Gen. §11-101(o), as amended by 2019 Md. H.B. 1301, effective Oct. 1, 2019; Md. Code Ann. Tax-Gen. §11-403.1, as added by 2019 Md. H.B. 1301, effective Oct. 1, 2019; Md. Code Ann. Tax-Gen. §11-502.1, as added by 2019 Md. H.B. 1301, effective Oct. 1, 2019. A marketplace facilitator is a person who facilitates a retail sale by a marketplace seller by listing or advertising tangible personal property for sale in a marketplace, collecting payment from a buyer, and transmitting payment to the marketplace seller. A marketplace seller is a person who makes a retail sale or sale for use through a physical or electronic marketplace operated by a facilitator. Md. Code Ann. Tax-Gen. §11-101(c-2), as amended by 2019 Md. H.B. 1301, effective Oct. 1, 2019. A marketplace facilitator and seller may petition the Comptroller for a waiver of the requirement that the facilitator collect and remit sales and use tax if: the marketplace seller is a communications company that is publicly traded or is controlled by a publicly traded company; the marketplace facilitator and seller agree that the seller will collect all applicable sales and use taxes;and the marketplace seller provides evidence to the facilitator that it is licensed as an out-of-state vendor or retail vendor in Maryland. Md. Code Ann. Tax-Gen. §11-403.1(H), as added by 2019 Md. H.B. 1301, effective Oct. 1, 2019 If the seller fails to collect the appropriate sales tax due, then the seller is personally liable to pay the tax. Md. Code Ann. Tax-Gen. §11-601(c)(2).

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Business Owners, Operators

Yes The Comptroller of Maryland imposes personal liability for unpaid sales and use taxes of a corporation, on the president, vice president or treasurer of the corporation, and on any officer of the corporation who directly or indirectly owns more than 20 percent of the corporation's stock. Md. Code Ann. Tax-Gen. §11-601(d)(1). Personal liability extends to all members of a limited liability company if the limited liability company has no operating agreement. The liability is imposed on a joint and several basis, meaning that the Comptroller of Maryland can assess the unpaid sales tax against any single individual who is liable, or against a group of liable individuals. In situations where the limited liability company has an operating agreement, personal liability extends to individuals who manage the business and its affairs. Md. Code Ann. Tax-Gen. §11-601(d)(2). Limited liability partnerships which do not have a written partnership agreement extend personal liability to all general partners. If the limited liability partnership has a written agreement, then persons who manage the business and its affairs have personal liability. Md. Code Ann. Tax-Gen. §11-601(d)(3). Successor Liability Often when a business is sold in its entirety, the issue arises whether the business accrued unpaid sales taxes while under the management of the previous business owners. In Maryland, the bulk sale or transfer of the assets requires a transferee to mail to the Comptroller a notice to creditors. Md. Code Ann. Tax-Gen. §11-505(a). If the Comptroller determines that the transferor owes sales and use tax, the Comptroller will file a claim and the transferee is required to withhold the amount due. Md. Code Ann. Tax-Gen. §11-505(c). If the transferee does not notify the Comptroller, then the transferee is personally liable for the sales and use tax, interest and penalties that the transferor owed to the state.

If the taxpayer expects that future tax payment obligations will average more than$100 per month he or she must notify the Comptroller. Moreover, taxpayers who are scheduled to file returns less than four times per year must file a supplemental return during non-scheduled return months when taxes for that month are greater than $100. Md. Regs. Code §03.06.03.03(B). Generally, a return is considered timely filed if postmarked on or before the filing deadline. BNA-SUTN MD 31.5.1.

Md. Regs. Code §03.06.01.22(B); see Maryland Tax Tip No. 2. An exemption certificate is not transferable and applies only to purchases made by the organization listed on the certificate. It may not be used by officials, members, or employees to purchase items for their personal use or to purchase items that will be donated to the organization. Md. Regs. Code §03.06.01.22(B); see Maryland Tax Tip No. 6; Maryland Tax Tip No. 2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Resale Exemption Certificates

Required The duty of a vendor to collect the sales and use tax from a buyer is waived if the buyer provides the vendor with a signed resale certificate. Md. Regs. Code §03.06.01.14(B). The resale certificate does not have to be in any particular form, however, it must state the name, address, and the Maryland sales and use tax registration number of the buyer. The certificate must also state that the tangible personal property or taxable service is bought for the purpose of resale. Md. Regs. Code §03.06.01.14(B). Vendors are required to obtain the resale certificate before the sale is consummated to support every transaction for which the exemption is claimed. However, a buyer making repeated purchases from a vendor may provide a blanket resale certificate to the vendor and claim the resale exclusion on subsequent purchases by providing the buyer's Maryland sales and use tax registration number on its purchase orders. Md. Regs. Code §03.06.01.14(E). Retail vendors that are required to have a state sales tax license covering retail sales made to final consumers are required to have a certificate of exemption to cover the purchaser's sales for resale. Md. Code Ann. Tax-Gen. §11-408(b); see Maryland Tax Tip No. 4. The Comptroller of Maryland provides no specific form for a resale certificate. However, a resale certificate must include the buyer's name, address, Maryland sales and use tax registration number, and a signed statement indicating that the purchase of tangible property or taxable service is intended for resale or will be incorporated into a product or service for sale. Vendors should do the following to avoid liabilities related to resale certificate purchases:• the vendor should collect the resale certificate; • the vendor should clearly document the reason for all exempt sales; and • the vendor should establish procedures to obtain valid resale certificates at the point of sale, and review its files periodically for accuracy and completeness. Md. Code Ann. Tax-Gen. §11-408; see Maryland Tax Tip No. 4. If the taxable price is less than $200 for a cash, check, or credit card sale or sale for use that is not a retail sale and the tangible personal property or taxable service is not delivered by the vendor directly to the buyer's retail place of business:• the sales and use tax must be paid when the sale is made or when the use becomes taxable; and • the buyer who pays the sales and use tax may file a claim for a refund with the Comptroller.
