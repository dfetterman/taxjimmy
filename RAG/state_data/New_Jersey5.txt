Nontaxable Nontaxable real property includes any structure or appurtenance permanently affixed to land. N.J. Admin. Code tit. 18, §24-5.2; New Jersey Sales and Use Tax Bulletin SU-3. Nontaxable real property also includes any personal property affixed to real property such that it cannot be removed without causing material injury to the personal property itself or to the real property to which it is affixed. See Middlesex Water Co. v. Div. of Taxn., 437 A.2d 368, 377 (N.J. Tax Ct. 1981) (holding that for sales and use tax purposes “real property” is defined to include “[g]oods and chattels so affixed to real property as to become part thereof and not to be severable or removable without material injury thereto”, the definition of “real property”under now repealed N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:11A-2(b)(2) of the former Business Personal Property Tax Act; N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:4-1 (defining “real property” for real property tax purposes as “all land and improvements thereon [including] personal property affixed to the real property or an appurtenance thereto, unless: (1) The personal property so affixed can be removed or severed without material injury to the real property; (2) The personal property so affixed can be removed or severed without material injury to the personal property itself; and (3) The personal property so affixed is not ordinarily intended to be affixed permanently to real property; or” if the personal property so affixed constitutes certain machinery, apparatus, or equipment). The installation of a generator which will be permanently affixed to the property is an exempt capital improvement. The property owner must issue the contractor a fully completed Certificate of Exempt Capital Improvement (Form ST-8) to document the exemption.

Depends The installation by a contractor of tangible personal property which results in an increase in the value or significant increase in the useful life of the real property into which it is installed is exempt from New Jersey sales and use tax as an exempt capital improvement, with enumerated exceptions. N.J. Admin. Code tit. 18, §24-5.6(b)(3); N.J. Admin. Code tit. 18, §24-5.16(a)(6)(i); New Jersey Sales and Use Tax Bulletin SU-3. In some states, the sale and installation upon real property of complete items of tangible personal property such as kitchen appliances and electronic equipment, sometimes referred to as “fixtures”, is treated as a taxable sale of tangible personal property the same as if these items were sold uninstalled. For sales and use tax purposes, New Jersey exempts installations of tangible personal property that constitute capital improvements to real property. However, there are also capital improvements that are taxable. New Jersey Sales and Use Tax Bulletin SU-2. Examples of exempt capital improvements include the installation of:• new bath and kitchen fixtures; • new siding; • in-ground swimming pools; • new roof and gutters; • new central air conditioner; • new storm doors and windows; • new heating system;and • new hot water heater.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Contractor Classifications

Yes Contractors A contractor is an individual or business entity engaged in the business of improving, altering, or repairing the land, buildings, or other real property of others. Sales of materials and supplies to contractors are taxable, because the contractor is considered the final consumer(or end user) of these items. See New Jersey Sales and Use Tax Bulletin SU-3. The work performed by a contractor can be a capital improvement, a repair, or a maintenance service. Contractors working in New Jersey are required to register with New Jersey and collect sales tax on charges for labor when required. See New Jersey Sales and Use Tax Bulletin SU-3. The following persons are considered contractors for New Jersey sales tax purposes:• builders; • plumbers; • electricians; • carpenters; • painters; • paper hangers; • roofers; • masons;and • landscapers. See New Jersey Sales and Use Tax Bulletin SU-3. Fabricator/Contractors The term “contractor” also includes those who manufacture, sell, and install items which become part of real property (e.g., manufacturers and sellers of kitchen cabinets and vanities who also install those items). Fabricator/contractors follow special rules for paying sales or use tax on materials, and collecting sales tax on the sale and/or installation of the product. See New Jersey Sales and Use Tax Bulletin SU-3. Materials Fabricator/contractors may treat the purchase of materials used to make the product as a purchase for resale. That is, a Resale Certificate (Form ST-3) may be issued to the supplier and no sales tax is paid at the time of purchase. Issuing a Resale Certificate is beneficial if a fabricator/contractor generally sells the product but does not do the installation himself (see Sale and Installation (Form ST-3 Issued for Materials), below). On the other hand, if a fabricator/contractor generally sells and installs the product, and such installation results in an exempt capital improvement, it would be beneficial for the fabricator/contractor to simply pay tax on the purchase of materials, rather than issue a Resale Certificate. A fabricator/contractor's payment of tax on materials does not relieve him of the obligation to collect tax when either the product is sold at retail without installation, or when the product is installed and the installation does not result in an exempt capital improvement. See New Jersey Sales and Use Tax Bulletin SU-3. Installation If a fabricator/contractor issues a Resale Certificate(Form ST-3) to the supplier when purchasing materials, the fabricator/contractor must collect sales tax from the property owner when he sells and/or installs his product as follows:• where the fabricator/contractor sells his completed product, but does not do the installation himself, he must collect sales tax from the customer on the retail sales price of the fabricated product. • where the fabricator/contractor sells his product and installs it in New Jersey, and the installation results in an exempt capital improvement, the fabricator/contractor does not collect sales tax from the property owner on the installation charge. The fabricator/contractor must pay use tax directly to the State on the value of the fabricated product being installed. The fabricator/contractor's use tax is based on the price at which items of the same kind are offered for retail sale by him; or if the fabricator/contractor makes no sales of items of the same kind, on the cost of materials used in making the product. See New Jersey Sales and Use Tax Bulletin SU-3. Floor Covering Dealers A “floor covering dealer” is someone who makes retail sales of floor coverings. When a dealer installs the floor covering he sells, the dealer is both a retail seller and a contractor. New Jersey Sales Tax Publication ANJ-5 (March 3, 2017). Retail sales of floor covering is taxable as a sale of tangible personal property. New Jersey Sales Tax Publication ANJ-5 (March 3, 2017). In addition, charges for the installation of floor covering are subject to tax whether or not the installation results in capital improvement. New Jersey Sales Tax Publication ANJ-5 (March 3, 2017).

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Subcontractors

Taxable A subcontractor is a contractor who agrees to perform specified operations for another contractor (i.e., a prime contractor). See New Jersey Sales and Use Tax Bulletin SU-3. The purchases of a subcontractor are treated in the same manner as the purchases of a prime contractor. Subcontractors are the retail purchasers of the materials and supplies that they purchase for use in performing work for the prime contractor. They must pay sales tax to the supplier at the time of purchase, unless the materials are for exclusive use on a job for a prime contractor who is performing work on the real property of an exempt organization, a qualified business in an urban enterprise zone, or a qualified housing sponsor. See New Jersey Sales and Use Tax Bulletin SU-3. The subcontractor must obtain from the prime contractor the documentation needed to make such exempt purchases of materials and supplies. A subcontractor who performs taxable services for a prime contractor does not bill the prime contractor for sales tax on the labor portion of his bill. The prime contractor is responsible for collecting sales tax from the property owner on the work done by the subcontractor. The subcontractor should keep records to document that sales tax was not collected because the services were performed for a prime contractor. There is an exception to this treatment when a subcontractor provides services that are merely related to the construction work in general. See New Jersey Sales and Use Tax Bulletin SU-3.
