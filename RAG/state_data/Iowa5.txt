Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Real Property

Nontaxable Iowa considers both land and water rights as real property, in addition to buildings and structures. Iowa Code Ann. §427A.1.1. This includes:• substances contained in or growing upon the land, before severance from the land, and rights to such substances; • buildings, structures or improvements, any of which are constructed on or in the land, attached to the land, or placed upon a foundation whether or not attached to the foundation; and • buildings, structures, equipment, machinery or improvements, any of which are attached to the buildings, structures, or improvements. Iowa Code Ann. §427A.1.1. Iowa law recognizes that tangible personal property may become so annexed to real property that the tangible personal property is properly regarded as being part of nontaxable real property. Iowa Code Ann. §427A.1.1; see Iowa Revenue Policy Letter No. 16300073 (Oct. 27, 2016) (determining whether farming equipment became annexed to real property). BNA-SUTN IA 28.1.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal General Rule for Classification

Three-Part Test Tangible personal property which is connected to real property in a way that it cannot be removed without damage to itself or to the real property is a fixture, and is considered to be real property sales of which are not subject to sales and use tax. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-225.6(4). In some states, the sale and installation on real property of complete items of tangible personal property, such as kitchen appliances and electronic equipment, sometimes referred to as “fixtures,” is treated as a taxable sale of tangible personal property the same as if these items were sold uninstalled. In this vein, Iowa has determined that audio and video equipment that is readily removable and that also can be transported and set up in another structure remains tangible personal property. Iowa Revenue Policy Letter No. 03300108 (May 30, 2003). Iowa also excludes from the definition of fixtures, property that is used for cooking, refrigeration or freezing. Iowa Code Ann. §427A.1.3A. In determining whether tangible personal property has been affixed to real property in such a manner as to become a part of the real property, Iowa courts have used a three- pronged test. The first prong looks at the annexation of the tangible personal property. Annexation may be either actual or constructive. The second prong looks at the use of the tangible personal property as it relates to the real property. The third prong seeks to determine whether the tangible personal property was intended to be a permanent attachment to the real property. Marty v. Champlin Refining Co., 36 N.W.2d 360, 365 (Iowa 1949); see also Winnike v. Heyman, 169 N.W. 631 (Iowa 1918); Lamble v. Schreiber, 19 N.W.2d 669 (Iowa 1945). Other criteria used by the department of revenue to determine whether tangible personal property has become a structure, include: • the degree of architectural and engineering skills necessary to design and construct the structure; • the overall scope of the business and the contractual obligations of the person designing and building the structure; • the amount and variety of materials needed to complete the structure, including the identity of materials prior to assembly and the complexity of assembly; • the size and weight of the structure; • the permanency or degree of annexation of the structure to other real property that would affect its mobility; and • the cost of building, moving, or dismantling the structure. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-19.11(422,423); Iowa Sales and Use Tax Information 78-527; see Iowa Revenue Policy Letter No. 16300073 (Oct. 27, 2016) (applying this test to a farmer's purchase of a manure scraper). If tangible personal property becomes or will become affixed to real property, then the tax treatment of the sale of the property so affixed follows the rules laid out in Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Iowa 28.2.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Construction Materials and Contracts Construction Materials and Contracts, Generally

Taxable Iowa imposes a sales and use tax upon all sales of building materials, supplies, and equipment to owners, contractors, subcontractors, or builders for the erection of buildings, or the alteration, repair, or improvement of real property. Iowa Code Ann. §423.2(1)(b); Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-219.2; Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-219.3. If the purchaser of the building materials, supplies, or equipment is also a vendor of such tangible personal property, the purchaser is entitled to purchase the property tax free as a sale for resale. Purchases of materials, equipment, and supplies made in such a manner require that the retailer collect sales tax on any subsequent sale of the property, or accrue use tax upon any subsequent use of the property in a construction contract. Iowa Code Ann. §423.2(1)(b); Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-219.2–.4; Iowa Revenue Policy Letter No. 16300083 (Oct. 14, 2016); Iowa Revenue Policy Letter No. 16300082 (Oct. 11, 2016). The sale of carpeting to owners, contractors, subcontractors or builders is the sale of ordinary tangible personal property and is subject to tax. Iowa Code Ann. §423.2(1)(b). For purposes of the sales and use tax code, Iowa uses the following definitions: Examples of Taxable Building Materials and Supplies The following items are examples of building materials and supplies that when purchased by a contractor are subject to sales and use tax: • asphalt; • bricks; • caulking material; • cement; • central air conditioning; • cleaning compounds; • conduit; • doors; • ducts; • electric wiring, connections and switching devices; • fencing materials; • flooring (that is shaped to fit a floor and is attached with tacks or cement); • insulation; • lead; • lighting fixtures; • lumber; • millwork; • modular homes; • mortar; • oil and paint; • piping and pipe fixtures; • plumbing supplies; • power poles, towers, and lines; • rock salt; • sand; • sheet metal; • wallboard. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-219.3(3). “Building equipment”is any vehicle, machine, tool, implement, or other device used by a contractor in erecting structures for others. Building equipment may also be used in altering, expanding, or repairing and remodeling property of others. Building equipment does not become a physical part of the property on which the work is being performed. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-219.3(4). An exemption from tax is provided for the sales of all goods, wares, or merchandise that are sold, or of services that are furnished, and are used in the fulfillment of a written construction contract for the original construction of a building or structure to be used as a collaborative educational facility, provided that the educational facility also meets certain enumerated criteria. Similarly, a tax exemption is available for sales of all goods, wares, or merchandise, or services that are furnished, and are used in the fulfillment of a written construction contract for the construction of additions or modifications to a building or structure used as part of a collaborative educational facility. Iowa Code Ann. §423.3(89)(b); Iowa Code Ann. §423.6(6). Additionally, an exemption is provided for the sales price of the lease or rental of machinery, equipment, or replacement parts used directly and primarily in the new construction, reconstruction, alteration, expansion, or remodeling of real property and for related services. Iowa Code Ann. §423.3(37). See Iowa Tax Protest Letter No. 16300063 (Sept. 15, 2016) (granting refund to construction business for tax paid on the lease of machinery and equipment used in new construction). Services When services are sold in connection with new construction, reconstruction, alteration, expansion, remodeling, or the services are of a general building contractor, architect, or an engineer, the sales price of the services is exempt from tax. Iowa Code Ann. §423.3(37); Iowa Code Ann. §423.6(6). This exemption extends to sales price of the services provided with the lease or rental of all machinery, equipment, and replacement parts directly and primarily used by owners, contractors, subcontractors, and builders for new construction, reconstruction, alteration, expansion, or remodeling of real property or structures and of all machinery, equipment, and replacement parts that improve the performance, safety, operation, or efficiency of the machinery, equipment, and replacement parts that are used. Iowa Code Ann. §423.3(37); Iowa Code Ann. §423.6(6). See also Iowa Policy Letter No. 16300002 (Jan. 22, 2016) (construction contractor owes use tax on leased construction equipment purchased outside Iowa). Because the equipment must be used directly in providing construction services, the sale price of renting construction trailers or storage trailers is subject to tax, as is renting a copying machine in the trailer. Iowa Policy Letter No. 14300037 (Oct. 15, 2014). Baseball and Softball Complex Sales Tax Rebate Iowa offers a rebate for sales taxes paid on purchases associated with a project to construct a qualified baseball or softball complex. To qualify for the exemption, any facility seeking the rebate must apply to the Iowa Economic Development Authority Board. The qualifying entity must be any baseball and softball complex with construction costs of at least $10 million completed after July 1, 2016. There is a cap of $2.5 million or 10 years of rebates for individual complexes, whichever comes first. The amount of rebates paid from each baseball and softball complex's account within the fund cannot exceed the amount of the award or $5 million dollars. The program continues until $5 million in funds have been rebated.

Depends With respect to a lump-sum mixed construction contract, charges for machinery and equipment furnished and installed and the installation charges are subject to Iowa's sales and use tax. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-219.10. Mixed contracts are construction contracts with equipment sales. Under mixed contracts, the contractor must purchase for resale to the customer, any machinery or equipment that does not become part of the real property. Thus, the contractor does not pay tax at the time of purchase, but rather collects sales tax from the customer. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-219.10. BNA-SUTN IA 28.3.2.

Depends Generally, in Iowa sales of repair services to a structure are subject to sales and use tax. However, sales of services that are otherwise taxable are exempt from sales and use tax if the services are performed in connection with new construction, reconstruction, alteration, expansion, remodeling. Iowa Code Ann. §423.(3)(37). In Iowa, a repair service means any service to mend, restore, maintain, replace an item. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-19.13(1); Iowa Sales and Use Tax Information 78-527. Services such as carpentry repair; electrical and electronic repair and installation; pipe fitting and plumbing; roof, shingle and glass repair; and excavating and grading are subject to sales tax if they are not performed in connection with new construction, reconstruction, alteration, expansion or remodeling. Iowa Code Ann. §423.2(6); Iowa Publication 78-527, Construction Contractors Guide; see Lowe's Home Ctrs., LLC v.

Repairing vs. Remodeling It can be difficult to determine the difference between taxable repair services and tax-exempt remodeling, alteration, or reconstruction services. The Department of Revenue emphasizes that the intent of the parties and the scope of the project may be factors used to make such a determination. Exempt services are generally of a size or scale equivalent to a new structure, or part thereof. Taxable repair services contemplate an “existing structure or tangible personal property which has become imperfect and constitutes the restoration to a good and sound condition.” Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-219.13; see Lowe's Home Ctrs., LLC v. Iowa Dept. of Rev., 921 N.W.2d 38, 2018 BL 465012 (Iowa 2018) (distinguishing remodeling work from repair work).

Iowa Code Ann. §423.3(37); Iowa Publication 78-527, Construction Contractors Guide. Examples of services that would be considered tax-exempt new construction, reconstruction, alteration, expansion, or remodeling services include:• adding a garage to an existing building; • adding a deck to an existing structure; • replacing a complete roof; • adding a new room to an existing building; • adding a new room by building interior walls; • replacing kitchen cabinets with some modification; • paneling existing walls; • laying a new floor over an existing floor; • rebuilding a structure damaged by flood or fire; • adding a new wing to an existing building; • rearranging the interior physical structure of an existing building; and • replacing an entire water heater, water softener, furnace, or air conditioning unit.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Services to Real Property Excavation and Demolition

Taxable Charges for demolition services are taxable, unless performed on or connected with new construction, reconstruction, alteration, expansion, or remodeling of buildings or structures. Iowa Code Ann. §423.2.06; Iowa Publication 78-527, Construction Contractors Guide. Charges for excavation services also are subject to Iowa's sales and use tax. Excavation is defined as “the digging, hauling, hollowing out, scooping out, or making of a cut or hole in the earth,” and includes not only digging down into the earth, but also “the removal of whatever material or substance is found beneath the surface.” Iowa Code Ann. §423.2(6); Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-26.19. The Iowa Department of Revenue concluded that digging a hole and removing the old foundation to reset a cemetery monument constitutes excavation, and therefore, the charge for this service is taxable. The department further noted that charges for the other services involved in the resetting process—removing the headstone, mixing and pouring the concrete, and putting the headstone back—are not enumerated services, and therefore, charges for these services are not taxable.
