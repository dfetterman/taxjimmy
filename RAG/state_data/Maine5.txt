Nontaxable Maine does not impose the sales, use, or service provider taxes on services to or transfers of real property. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1811; Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1861; Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §2552. Maine imposes the sales, use, and service provider taxes on retail sales of tangible personal property and certain enumerated services; therefore, it is important to determine whether a transaction is for the sale of tangible personal property or the sale of real property. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1811; Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1861; Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1752; Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §2552. “Tangible personal property” means personal property that may be seen, weighed, measured, felt, touched or in any other manner perceived by the senses, but does not include rights and credits, insurance policies, bills of exchange, stocks and bonds and similar evidences of indebtedness or ownership. Real property is not included in the definition of tangible personal property and therefore is not subject to sales or use tax. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1752(17). BNA-SUTN ME 28.1.

Depends The tax consequences for fixtures is dependent upon whether the transaction involved is for the sale of tangible personal property or the sale of real property. Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 4. All of the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction must be taken into consideration. Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 4. Sales of tangible personal property for resale as tangible personal property are exempt from Maine's sales tax when resale certification is presented. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1752(11)(B); Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 4. Sales of tangible personal property incorporated or affixed into and sold as real property are taxable to the contractor. Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 4; Enerquin Air Inc. v. Maine State Tax Assessor, 670 A.2d 926 (Me. 1996), citing Katz v. Maine State Tax Assessor, 472 A.2d 428, 430-431 (Me. 1984). When constructing new buildings, repairing existing realty, and remodeling, a contractor is selling the materials used in construction after they have been affixed to the real property. The contractor is selling real property, not tangible personal property. Thus, the contractor must pay the tax as a consumer on the purchase of tangible personal property that is affixed to real property. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1811; Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1752; Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 4. In Enerquin Air Inc. v. Maine State Tax Assessor, the court held that a contractor was subject to use tax on the air process system it fabricated and installed in a building used to house a new paper machine because the system, which was originally tangible personal property, qualified as realty under the Bangor-Hydro Elec. Co. v. Johnson test. Enerquin Air Inc. v. Maine State Tax Assessor, 670 A.2d 926 (Me. 1996). Tangible personal property has become affixed to realty if it is determined the following are met:• it is physically annexed, at least by juxtaposition, to the realty or some appurtenance thereof; • it is adapted to the use to which the land to which it is annexed is put, or the chattel and the real estate are united in the prosecution of a common enterprise; and • it was annexed with the intention, on the part of the person making the annexation, to make it a permanent accession to the realty, which intention is not the hidden secret intention of the party making the annexation, but the intention which the law deduces from such external facts as the structure and mode of attachment, the purpose and use for which the annexation has been made and the relation and use of the party making it. Enerquin Air Inc. v. Maine State Tax Assessor, 670 A.2d 926 (Me. 1996), quoting Bangor-Hydro Elec. Co. v. Johnson, 226 A.2d 371, 378 (Me. 1967). BNA-SUTN ME 28.2.1.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Contracts with Exempt Entities

Nontaxable Maine exempts qualified sales to a construction contractor or subcontractor that works with an exempt entity. To qualify, the sale must be of tangible personal property that is physically incorporated in and becomes a permanent part of real property for an exempt organization or government agency. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1760(61); Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 36; Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 4. Further, the organization must use the item primarily in the organization's exempt activity. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1760(61); Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 36; Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 4. This exemption applies to lumber, hardware, doors, windows, nails, insulation, and other building materials actually permanently affixed to real property. Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 4. However, a contractor that provides services to the exempt organization still must pay tax on any item used to perform its service, such as tools, apparel, consumable supplies, fuel, machinery, and equipment. Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 36; Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 4. BNA-SUTN ME 28.7.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Mobile and Manufactured Homes

Depends Manufactured homes, mobile homes, and modular homes may or may not be exempt from Maine's sales and use tax dependent upon whether the homes are used or new and the homes' treatment as tangible personal property or real property. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1760(40). Manufactured Homes An exemption exists for the sales of used manufactured housing or new manufactured housing(to the extent of all costs included in the sale price, other than materials). However, the exemption for new manufactured housing cannot exceed 50 percent of the sale price. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1760(40). Mobile Homes The sale of a new mobile home is considered the sale of tangible personal property. The seller of the mobile home can purchase the home exempt from tax by furnishing a resale certificate. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1760(40); Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 31. Modular Homes Sales of new modular homes are considered sales of real property if the seller does more than deliver the home to the customer's location. In this situation, the seller must pay sales or use tax on the home. When the customer takes delivery of a modular home at the seller's location, or the seller delivers the home to the location of the customer without installing or erecting it, the modular home is the sale of tangible personal property. As a result, the customer must pay the sales tax to the seller, who in turn will remit the tax to the state. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 36, §1760(40); Maine Instructional Bulletin No. 31. BNA-SUTN ME 28.8.
