Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Real Property

Defined Minnesota defines tangible personal property to exclude property to which an ad valorem property tax applies, and effective May 31, 2017, specifically defines real property for sales and use tax purposes. Minn. Stat. §297A.61, as amended by 2017 Minn. H.F. 1, First Special Session, Art. 3, §8, effective May 31, 2017. Real Property Defined Minnesota's sales and use tax does not apply to property subject to ad valorem taxes, which includes property classified as “real property.” Minn. Stat. §297A.61(10)(b)(2); Minn. R. 8130.1200(1)(B). The definition of real property includes structures that are permanently affixed to real estate, such as buildings and fixtures. Minn. R. 8130.1200(1)(B). Effective May 31, 2017, Minnesota's sales and use tax statute defines real property to include:• land(whether owned or leased); • buildings and structures constructed or erected on the land and intended to be permanent; and • improvements and fixtures, including building materials and supplies, if incorporated into and intended to be of a permanent benefit to a building or structure given its present use, and that cannot be removed without causing substantial damage to the building or structure. Minn. Stat. §297A.61(58)(a), as added by 2017 Minn. H.F. 1, First Special Session, Art. 3, §8, effective May 31, 2017; Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 128; Minnesota Revenue Notice 18-04 (Dec. 17, 2018). In order to be permanent, buildings or structures must be attached to the land itself. Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 128. Examples of building materials and supplies include ceiling tiles, concrete, flooring, furnaces, ductwork, gutters, insulation, kitchen cabinets, lumber, sheetrock, nails, doors, windows, plumbing, sinks, and toilets. Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 128. Real property does not include tools, implements, machinery, and equipment attached or installed into real property used for business or production activity that qualify for a business exemption under Minn. Stat. §297A.68, regardless of weight or size, or how such items are incorporated into the real property. Minn. Stat. §297A.61(58)(b), as added by 2017 Minn. H.F. 1, First Special Session, Art. 3, § 8, effective May 31, 2017; Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 128; Minnesota Revenue Notice 18-04 (Dec. 17, 2018). Prior to May 31, 2017, the term “real property” was not defined in Minn. Stat. §297A.61, and the courts applied the definition of real property found in Minn. Stat. §272.03, which primarily includes improvements and fixtures which are integrated with and are of permanent benefit to the building or structure regardless of the building's current use but does not include machinery and equipment installed only for use in the business or production activity conducted thereon. Minn. Stat. §297A.61(4)(d); Dahmes Stainless v. Comm'r of Rev., No. 8228-R, (Minn. Tax Ct. Apr. 7, 2015) (A corporation selling, manufacturing, and installing industrial equipment including drying systems such as spray dryers, fluid bed dryers, heat recovery systems and other equipment that provided no structural support for the buildings housing the products properly collected tax under Minn. Stat. §297A.61(4)(A)(1). The Court rejected the Commissioner's position that components used to manufacture the products were taxable sales of building materials or supplies used for the improvement of real property under §297A.61(4)(D)). In some instances, tangible personal property will become affixed to real property and while not subject to an ad valorem tax on its own, such property will not be subject to sales and use tax to the party contracting for its installation because it is considered to become a part of real property. Thus, real property includes structures that are permanently affixed to real estate, such as buildings, fixtures, machinery, fences, bridges, outdoor advertising signs, and billboards. Minn. R. 8130.1200(1)(B). Other property usually incorporated into a building include lighting fixtures, plumbing and bathroom fixtures, furnaces, boilers and heating units for space heating, prefabricated cabinets and central air conditioning units. Minn. R. 8130.1200(1)(A). The purchaser of building materials and other items that will be incorporated into real property has to pay sales and use tax on such items. Minn. R. 8130.1200; Minnesota Revenue Notice 04-04, as revoked by 43 Minn. Reg. issue 25 (Dec. 17, 2018) and replaced with Minnesota Revenue Notice 18-04 (Dec. 17, 2018). However, in some instances the materials or items attached to real property retain their identity as tangible personal property. For example, the state considers computers to retain their classification as personal property when installed because of factors such as industry standards, custom and practice, usage and uniqueness. Furthermore, all items that are freestanding after installation onto land or in buildings or structures attached to land are considered to remain tangible personal property. Where an item does not lose its identity as personal property, the contractor will not have to pay the sales and use tax and will instead collect tax from the contractee. Minn. R. 8130.1200; Minnesota Revenue Notice 04-04, as revoked by 43 Minn. Reg. issue 25 (Dec. 17, 2018) and replaced with Minnesota Revenue Notice 18-04 (Dec. 17, 2018). Plants Trees, shrubs, and perennial plants are considered an improvement to real property. Charges for planting these items are not subject to sales tax. However, annual flower and vegetable plants and sod are not a fixture to real property. Charges for planting annual or seasonal plants are only exempt if performed under an initial landscaping construction contract. Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 121B. For more information about landscaping and other grounds services, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Minnesota 22.6. Automatic Fire-Safety Sprinkler Systems Automatic fire-safety sprinkler systems are exempt from tax. Minn. Stat. § 297A.68(23). BNA-SUTN MN 28.1.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Construction Materials and Contracts Construction Materials and Contracts, Generally

Taxable Purchases of building materials, supplies and equipment by contractors, subcontractors, and builders for the erection of buildings or the alteration, repair, or improvement of real property are retail sales and thus taxable. Minn. Stat. §297A.61(4)(d); Morton Bldgs. Inc. v. Minnesota Comr. of Rev., 488 N.W.2d 254 (Minn. 1992); see also Minnesota Basic Sales and Use Tax Manual; Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 128. The term “building materials, supplies, and equipment” refers to property intended to become part of a new building, structure, road or an addition, repair, improvement, or alteration to roads or real estate. Minn. R. 8130.1200(1)(A); Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 128. A general contractor is someone who contracts to furnish the necessary materials and labor for the performance of construction contract. The general contractor is the one who normally contracts to build the entire project or major part of, or contracts to install special building equipment, or repairs or remodels a limited area in a structure at a price that includes machinery, equipment, and installation charges. A construction contract is a contract where a contractor agrees to perform construction activities that result in the alteration, repair, or improvement to real property. The attachment of machinery or equipment to real property that loses its identity as tangible personal property, the contract for the installation of the property is regarded as a construction contract. Where machinery and equipment is attached to real property with the intent that it becomes a non-temporary addition to the real property, the contract is considered a construction contract. The contractor would be responsible for sales and use tax on the purchase of materials, machinery and equipment installed pursuant to the contract. Minn. R. 8130.1200(2)(D); Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 128. A construction contract does not include any contract for a sale of machinery or equipment that the seller attaches or installs upon real property if:• the machinery or equipment is such a size and installed in a way it retains its character as personal property; Minn. R. 8130.1200(2)(D)(1). or • the purchaser is not the owner of the real property to which the property will be attached, and the machinery or equipment can be removed without material injury to the realty; Minn. R. 8130.1200(2)(D)(2). or • the title to the machinery or equipment passes from the seller to the purchaser prior to the attachment or installation on the real property. Minn. R. 8130.1200(2)(D)(3). Construction activities also do not include the sale and installation of an appliance, machinery, equipment or other item of tangible personal property that does not become a part of real estate. In general, the contractor would not be responsible for the payment of tax upon its purchase of these items. Instead, tax would be collected from the purchaser. It is important to note that where a fixed price or lump sum construction contract provides for the incidental transfer of certain tangible personal property that is not considered to become part of real property and the contractor provides these items only as part of the construction project, the contractor is not regarded as a retailer of these items as long as the personal property comprises an insubstantial portion of the total contract price. Minn. R. 8130.1200(2)(E). Purchases of Construction Materials by Contractor-Retailers Contractors that sell construction materials primarily at retail may be exempt from paying sales and use tax on construction materials purchased if the contractor intends to resell the items, in which case the contractor should present a Form ST3, Certificate of Exemption at the time of purchase. A contractor that is primarily a retailer must collect sales tax from the purchaser of the material and remit sales tax to the department of revenue, accordingly. Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 128. A contractor is primarily a retailer if at least 50 percent of the contractor's business purchases are from retail sales. Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 128. If any items purchased exempt for resale are later used in a construction contract, the contractor must pay the applicable use tax on the items. Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 128. A contractor that is primarily a retailer performing a construction contract is not required to itemize tax on their customer's bill or invoice. On the other hand, for sales at retail made by the contractor, sales tax must be itemized on the purchaser's bill or invoice. Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 128. A contractor that is primarily a contractor may deduct the cost of materials on which tax was already paid at the time of filing a return if the contractor paid sales tax on the item at the time of purchase and ultimately resold the item at retail. Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 128. Combination Construction Contracts A lump sum construction contract to perform taxable building cleaning and maintenance together with exempt construction, alteration, or improvements to real property is considered a construction contract when 50 percent or more of the total cost of the contract is for improvement of real property. Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 112. Construction Exemptions The gross receipts from the sale of, and storage, distribution, use, or consumption of the following tangible personal property are specifically exempt from sales and use tax regardless of whether they are purchased by the owner, contractor, subcontractor, or builder: Minn.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Contractor Classifications

Yes Contractor-Retailers A “contractor-retailer”is a person using building materials, supplies, and equipment in the performance of construction contracts and engaged in making retail sales of building materials, supplies, and equipment. Minn. R. 8130.1200(4); Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 128. Sales of building materials, supplies, and equipment by a contractor-retailer are retail sales if the contractor does not provide for installation. Minn. R. 8130.1200(4)(A); Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 128. A sale of materials, supplies, and equipment by a contractor-retailer who provides installation services of such items is deemed a construction contract per the definitions discussed above and the contractor will have to pay the tax on the cost of the items. If the contractor-retailer executes two separate contracts, one for installation and one for building supplies, the contracts are considered one unified construction contract provided that the materials so installed lose their identity as tangible property. Minn. R. 8130.1200(4)(B); Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 128. Contractor as a Purchasing Agent A qualifying purchaser may appoint a contractor to buy equipment on its behalf. If all the following conditions are met, the owner may file a claim to request a refund of the sales tax paid:• there must be a written agreement establishing the relationship and granting the contractor the ability to bind the owner to pay for the purchases. • the capital equipment must be purchased in the name of the owner, not the contractor; • all contracts or purchase orders entered into by the contractor must contain a statement that the purchases are being made pursuant to an agency relationship and that the owner is obligated to pay for the capital equipment purchased. The owner can authorize the contractor to pay for the items directly as long as the owner reimburses the contractor for actual expenses; • the capital equipment purchased under the agreement must not be used by the contractor for its own use. If there is a separate lump sum contract that requires the contractor to turn over equipment to the owner, the equipment does not qualify; • title to all capital equipment purchased under the agreement passes directly to the owner at the point of delivery; • the risks of ownership of the capital equipment purchased under the agreement are with the owner.

The subcontractor ordinarily contracts with the general contractor to perform a certain part of the work which the general contractor has undertaken to perform under the general construction contract.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Contracts with Exempt Entities

Depends Purchases of building materials, supplies, and equipment by exempt entities are exempt from the sales and use tax. However, purchases of building materials, supplies, and equipment by a contractor under a construction contract with an exempt entity are subject to sales and use tax, unless the contractor has been appointed the purchasing agent of the exempt entity. Minn. R. 8130.1200(3)(A); Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 128; Minnesota Local Governments Industry Guide; Minnesota Revenue Notice 17-10 (Dec. 4, 2017). If the contractor and exempt entity enter into a fixed price construction contract that covers the complete structure including materials, and the exempt entity furnishes some or all of the materials to the contractor for credit against the contract price, the transfer of materials from the exempt entity to the contractor is a taxable sale. Minn. R. 8130.1200(3)(B). The transfer of building materials by an exempt entity to its contractor for use in the erection, alteration, repair, or improvement of realty is exempt from the sales and use tax when: Minn. R. 8130.1200(3)(C). • the contract is for labor only; Minn. R. 8130.1200(3)(C)(1). • all incidents of ownership to the building materials remain in the exempt entity at all times; Minn. R. 8130.1200(3)(C)(2). • the contractor bears no responsibility for inherent defects in the building materials; Minn. R. 8130.1200(3)(C)(3). and • the contractor bears no risk of loss of any of the building materials. Minn. R. 8130.1200(3)(C)(4). Purchasing Agent Designation An exempt entity may designate and appoint the contractor as a purchasing agent for the exempt entity for a specific construction contract. Minnesota Revenue Notice 17-10 (Dec. 4, 2017). A contractor cannot qualify as the purchasing agent of an exempt entity if the contract is a lump-sum contract or similar type of contract covering both materials and labor. Minnesota Revenue Notice 17-10 (Dec. 4, 2017). An agency relationship is only recognized if the written contract sets forth:• that such appointment has been made; • that the title to all materials and supplies purchased pursuant to such appointment will immediately vest in the owner or principal at point of delivery; • that the risk of loss with respect to such materials and supplies is that of the owner or principal; and • that the owner or principal, and not the agent, has responsibility for all defective materials and supplies, including those incorporated into realty purchased in such manner. Minn. R. 8130.1200(3)(D); Minnesota Revenue Notice 17-10 (Dec. 4, 2017). Further, an exempt entity may only appoint a purchasing agency if:• the exempt entity initially advertises for separate bids for materials and labor; • the contract allows the entity to either accept the bid for materials or the bid for labor, and does not require the entity to accept both;and • separate contracts are issued for materials and labor. Minnesota Revenue Notice 17-10 (Dec. 4, 2017). Additionally, the building or facility being constructed or altered must be principally used by the exempt entity. Minnesota Revenue Notice 17-10 (Dec. 4, 2017). Finally, the contractor must provide all vendors with adequate notification that it is the exempt entity's obligation to make payment for materials and supplies, not the contractor's. Minnesota Revenue Notice 17-10 (Dec. 4, 2017). If all of these conditions are met, when making exempt purchases the contractor must furnish its suppliers with a completed Form ST3, Certificate of Exemption. The contractor must also keep records that show a purchasing agent relationship exists, such as a copy of the contract and evidence of the contractee organization's exempt status, as well as records that identify all materials and supplies purchased for the exempt project. Minnesota Dept. of Rev., Purchasing Agent Contracts with Exempt Organizations. A subcontractor is deemed to qualify for the purchasing agent exemption if, at the time of the sale or purchase of the materials or supplies, the subcontractor has done all of the following:• submitted separate bids for labor and materials, or submitted a bid for only materials; • obtained separate contracts for labor and materials, or obtained a contract for only materials; • obtained a letter or other notice appointing the subcontractor and all other subcontractors who will use the materials and the general contractor as purchasing agents for the exempt entity; and • obtained a copy of the completed Form ST3, Certificate of Exemption, showing that the entity is exempt from sales and use tax.
