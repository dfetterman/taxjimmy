Topic: Utilities, Fuel, Mining and Natural Resource Extraction, Production, Sale Mining, Timber, Natural Resource Extraction Mining

Nontaxable The gross receipts from the sale of, and the storage, use or other consumption in Nevada of, the proceeds of mines which are subject to taxes levied pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §362 are not subject to sales and use tax. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.270. Nevada's sales and use tax exemption under Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.270 for minerals extracted from mines within the state has been struck down as unconstitutional discrimination against interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Sierra Pacific Power Co. v. Nevada Dept. of Taxn., 338 P.3d 1244 (Nev. 2014); see also S. Cal. Edison v. Nevada Dept. of Taxn., 133 Nev. Adv. Rep. 49, 2017 BL 262146 (Nev. 2017) (payment of use tax on coal imported from Arizona did not discriminate against interstate commerce). The court concluded that Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.270 is not severable because it is clear that the legislative intent of the statute was to protect local mines, and thus, the district court properly refused to extend the exemption to all mine and mineral proceeds. Violations of the dormant Commerce Clause are remedied by compensating for the negative impact to the claimant as measured by the unfair advantage provided to the claimant's competitors. If interstate discrimination occurred and an out-of-state company was able to demonstrate deprivation as a result of the statute's enforcement, the company may be entitled to a refund. See Sierra Pacific Power Co. v. Nevada Dept. of Taxn., 338 P.3d 1244 (Nev. 2014); see also S. Cal. Edison v. Nevada Dept. of Taxn., 133 Nev. Adv. Rep. 49, 2017 BL 262146 (Nev. 2017) (payment of use tax on coal imported from Arizona did not discriminate against interstate commerce). BNA-SUTN NV 30.3.1.
