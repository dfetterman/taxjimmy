State: Louisiana



Topic: Administration and Procedure Agencies Responsible for Administration State Sales and Use Tax

Louisiana Department of Revenue The Department of Revenue for the state of Louisiana is responsible for collecting and enforcing the collection of nearly all taxes, penalties, interests, and other charges due under Louisiana's sales and use tax provisions and for administering the legislative mandates contained therein. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:1502; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:1501. The secretary must formulate and prescribe a definite plan of organization for the department and its procedures for providing effective execution of the Louisiana's sales and use tax provisions. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:1504. The secretary is also authorized to prescribe, pursuant to the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, rules and regulations to carry out the purposes of Louisiana sales and use tax. Such rules and regulations will have the full effect of law. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:1511. Any duly authorized representative, acting under the authority and direction of the secretary, has the same power as the secretary to collect and enforce the collection of all taxes, penalties, interests, and other charges due under Louisiana's sales and use tax provisions and for administering the legislative mandates contained therein. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:1503. Additionally, effective June 22, 2017, the Department of Revenue announced it will establish the Louisiana Sales and Use Tax Commission for Remote Sellers. The Commission is generally intended to serve as a single point for remote sellers to register and remit Louisiana sales taxes in the event federal legislation is passed that would allow states to enforce sales tax collection and remittance requirements on those sellers who currently lack a physical presence in the state. The commission is also authorized to create policies for the administration of sales taxes paid by remote sellers and to act as a central office on behalf of all Louisiana local taxing jurisdictions for remote sellers. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:339(A), as added by 2017 La. H.B. 601, effective June 22, 2017. The Commission may take any action related to the collection of tax that the Secretary of Revenue may take. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:340(F)(2), as amended by 2019 La. H.B. 547, effective July 1, 2019. BNA-SUTN LA 31.1.1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Agencies Responsible for Administration Local Sales and Use Tax

Local Authority Local taxing authorities may elect to have their local sales and use taxes administered under any of several different arrangements. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.13. For instance, the local taxing authorities of one or more parishes may contract for the joint collection, enforcement, and distribution among them of their respective taxes by a single tax collector or a tax commission composed of members appointed by each taxing authority. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.13(A); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.13(B); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.13(C); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.13(G). In addition to selecting one of these arrangements for the day-to-day administration of their taxes, local taxing authorities may contract out their audit function to the government agency or private firm of their choosing. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.26(B). As with the state sales and use tax, Louisiana local sales and use taxes are legally imposed upon the purchaser of taxable property or services. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.17(A)(1); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.17(A)(2); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.17(C). The seller is required to collect the tax from the purchaser on behalf of the local taxing authority and remit the amount collected to the authority's designated tax collector. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.17(A)(1); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.17(A)(2); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.17(C). Simplified Administration for Remote Sellers Louisiana has authorized a program for simplified administration of Louisiana's sales tax for certain remote sellers who qualify as “dealers” in the state. These sellers are considered dealers solely by virtue of engaging in regular or systematic solicitation of a consumer market in Louisiana by the distribution of catalogs, periodicals, advertising fliers, or other advertising, or by means of print, radio, or television media, including, but not limited to, television shopping channels, by mail, telegraphy, telephone, computer database, cable, optic, microwave, or other communication system. Under this program, such sellers, who are referred to as direct marketers, collect an additional 4 percent in sales tax on each sale, for a total of 8.45 percent, and remit the entire amount to the Department of Revenue, in lieu of collecting the precise combined state and local sales tax rate and submitting tax to the appropriate local jurisdiction. This allows these sellers to bypass determining the correct tax rate for each individual local taxing jurisdiction in Louisiana, as well as having a central location for filing and remitting taxes. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:302(K); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:302(W)(6), as added by 2018 La. H.B. 17, effective June 12, 2018; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:321.1, as amended by 2018 La. H.B. 10, Third Extraordinary Session, effective July 1, 2018; Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin 18-019 (June 29, 2018); see Louisiana Form R-1031: Direct Marketer Sales Tax Return. Under the simplified program, 4.45 percent of the tax is allocated to the state and the other 4 percent is distributed amongst local taxing jurisdictions by the Department of Revenue. Prior to July 1, 2018, the combined direct seller rate was 9 percent. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:302(K); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:302(W)(6), as added by 2018 La. H.B. 17, effective June 12, 2018; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:321.1, as amended by 2018 La. H.B. 10, Third Extraordinary Session, effective July 1, 2018; Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin 18-019 (June 29, 2018); see Louisiana Form R-1031: Direct Marketer Sales Tax Return. Remote sellers who voluntarily collect Louisiana's sales tax also qualify for this program. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:302(K); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:302(W)(6), as added by 2018 La. H.B. 17, effective June 12, 2018; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:321.1, as amended by 2018 La. H.B. 10, Third Extraordinary Session, effective July 1, 2018; Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin 18-019 (June 29, 2018). The Sales and Use Tax Commission for Remote Sellers is the single entity responsible for all state and local sales and use tax administration, return processing, and audits for remote sales delivered into Louisiana. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:340(G)(1), as amended by 2019 La. H.B. 547, effective July 1, 2019. For more information about economic nexus, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Louisiana 3.1.2.4.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Vendor/Seller Registration

Required All dealers in Louisiana are required to register for sales tax purposes. Louisiana assigns sales tax identification numbers to those dealers who are properly registered to collect and remit sales tax. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(4); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.18; La. Admin. Code tit. 61, §4351(A). A dealer who must register includes any person engaged in the business of furnishing accommodations to transient guests, either at a single business location or a residential location. A dealer also includes a person engaged in collecting the amount required to be paid by a transient guest as a condition of occupancy at a residential location. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:306.4; Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin No. 16-036. Additionally, auctioneers must register as dealers. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:303(C). Nonresident prime contractors are required to register with the Louisiana Department of Revenue prior to commencing work on any construction contract exceeding $3,000. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.18(C). Businesses or individuals participating in a special event, such as a trade show or fair, at which taxable property or services will be sold are required to register with the department, even if they only participate in one sale per year in Louisiana. Louisiana Dept. of Rev., Special Events, Craft Shows, and Trade Shows. Remote sellers must apply for approval to collect state and local sales on use tax with the Sales and Use Tax Commission for Remote Sellers. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:340(G)(6), as amended by 2019 La. H.B. 547, effective July 1, 2019. BNA-SUTN LA 31.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Tax Collection and Remittance

Vendor Louisiana's sales and use tax is collectible from all persons engaged as dealers. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:303(a)(1). A “dealer”includes either party to a transaction creating a tax liability under state and local sales and use tax law. Thus, both the seller and the purchaser are liable for the collection of Louisiana sales and use tax. La. Admin. Code tit. 61, §4307(A). Local sales and use taxes are subject to the same state-level responsible party rules discussed above. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 47:338.26; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:338.54. Any individual taxpayer or other contestant in a proceeding before the board may appear and act for himself or for a partnership of which he is a member, and a taxpayer corporation may be represented by a bona fide officer of the corporation. La. Admin. Code tit. 61, §307(A). BNA-SUTN LA 31.3.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Purchaser Liability

Yes Purchasers who do not pay sales tax at the time of the sale, lease, or rental of tangible personal property or taxable services are liable for use tax on those purchases. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:302(A)(2); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:302(K)(2); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:302(U). Use tax owed by individual purchasers can be paid using Louisiana's Consumer Use Tax Return. Consumer use tax is rounded to the nearest whole dollar amount. Louisiana Form R-1035: Consumer Use Tax Return; Louisiana Form R-540CU-R: Consumer Use Tax Schedule - Resident; see Louisiana Dept. of Rev., Frequently Asked Questions: Consumer Use Tax (last visited July 25, 2019). Consumer Use Tax However, Louisiana does provide for somewhat simplified reporting of consumer use tax by applying an 8.45-percent tax rate to all remote purchases on which use tax is owed by the purchaser, in lieu of the combined state and local sales tax rate imposed in the purchaser's location. Under this program, purchasers are not obligated to determine the correct local jurisdiction to which their purchases should be sourced or calculate tax using multiple local rates. Of the 8.45-percent consumer use tax, 4.45 percent is allocated to the state and the other 4 percent is distributed amongst local taxing jurisdictions by the Department of Revenue. This simplified consumer use tax program went into effect on April 1, 2016. Prior to July 1, 2018, the simplified rate was 9 percent, with 5 percent allocated to the state and 4 percent distributed amongst the local jurisdictions. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:302(K); Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin 18-019 (June 29, 2018); Louisiana Dept. of Rev., Frequently Asked Questions: Consumer Use Tax (last visited July 25, 2019) (noting that the state tax rate was decreased to 4.45 percent from 5 percent by 2018 La. H.B. 10). BNA-SUTN LA 31.3.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Business Owners, Operators

Yes Where any corporation, limited liability company, or limited partnership fails to file sales and use tax returns or to remit to the state the sales and use tax collected from purchasers or consumers, the Secretary of Revenue may hold any officers, directors, managers, or members having direct control or supervision of such taxes or charged with the responsibility of filing sales and use tax returns and remitting such taxes, who willfully fail to remit or account for these taxes, jointly and severally liable for the payment of the delinquent taxes and any penalties, interest, and fees. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:1561.1(A). But see Thomas v. Bridges, 144 So. 3d 1001 (La. 2014) (sole member of an out-of-state limited liability company could not be held liable for tax on a recreational vehicle purchased by the limited liability company). Business Successor Liability A taxpayer who purchases a business or stock of goods must withhold a portion of the price sufficient to cover the amount of any taxes, penalties, and interest due and unpaid on the business or goods until the seller produces either a receipt from the Secretary of Revenue verifying that they have been paid or a certificate stating that no taxes, penalties, or interest are due. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:308(A); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.21(A); La. Admin. Code tit. 61, §4357.B. If such purchaser of a business or stock of goods fails to comply with this requirement, the purchaser will be personally liable for the unpaid taxes, penalties, and interest allocable to the business or stock of goods that accrued in connection with the seller's operation of the business. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:308(A); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.21(A); La. Admin. Code tit. 61, §4357.B. BNA-SUTN LA 31.3.3.

Relieves Liability Louisiana provides that a certified service provider who contracts with a seller to collect and remit sales and use taxes is an agent for the seller and is liable for sales and use tax due on all sales transactions it processes for the seller. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:335.9. The seller is not liable for sales or use tax due on transactions processed by the certified service provider unless the seller misrepresented the type of items it sells or committed fraud. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:335.9. Absent probable cause to believe that the seller has committed fraud or made a material misrepresentation, the seller is not subject to audit on transactions processed by the certified service provider. However, the seller remains subject to audit for transactions not processed by the certified service provider. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:335.9. Certified Automated System Persons that provide certified automated system are responsible for the proper functioning of that system and are liable to the state for underpayments of tax attributable to errors in the functioning of the certified automated system. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:335.9. A seller that uses a certified automated system remains responsible and is liable to the state for reporting and remitting tax. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:335.9.

Ann. § 47:338.26; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §338.54. The Secretary of Revenue must make a refund of each overpayment where it is determined that:• the tax was overpaid because of an error on the part of the taxpayer in mathematical computation on the face of the return or any of the supporting documents; • the tax was overpaid because of a construction of the law on the part of the taxpayer contrary to the secretary's construction of the law at the time of payment; • the overpayment was a result of an error, omission, or a mistake of fact of consequence to the determination of the tax liability, whether on the part of the taxpayer or the secretary; • the overpayment resulted from a change made by the secretary in an assessment, notice, or billing; or • the overpayment resulted from an overpayment of estimated Louisiana tax. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:1621. Any amount overpaid by the taxpayer may, before refund, be applied against any outstanding tax liability of the taxpayer. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:1622(A). Effective June 9, 2016, Louisiana requires a taxpayer to file electronically all refund claims of $25,000 or more and for all refund claims made by a tax preparer on behalf of the taxpayer, regardless of the amount requested. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:1520.2, as enacted by 2016 La. H.B. 756, effective June 9, 2016; Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin No. 16-040.

La. Admin. Code tit. 61, §2103(A);Louisiana Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Agreement (July 1, 2011). For eligible taxpayers entering into voluntary disclosure agreements, the department will waive all delinquent filing and delinquent payment penalties, other than those relating to taxes that have been collected and not remitted, and limit the look-back period for which taxes must be paid. La. Admin. Code tit. 61, §2103(A); La. Admin. Code tit. 61, §2103(C); La. Admin. Code tit. 61, §2101(D). In situations where the tax has been collected but not remitted, a request to waive some portion of the penalty may be submitted. Whether a waiver is granted is determined on a case-by-case basis. La. Admin. Code tit. 61, §2103(C);Louisiana Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Agreement (July 1, 2011). The look-back period will include all delinquent periods in the current calendar year, plus the three immediately preceding calendar years.

La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.102(F); La. Admin. Code tit. 72, §105, adopted effective March 20, 2019. An undisclosed liability will qualify for a voluntary disclosure agreement if it results from the underpayment or non-payment of sales tax due to an error in the mathematical computation of the tax due on the return, interpretation of the law, or process of reporting the tax due on the return. An undisclosed liability also qualifies if it resulted from the merger or acquisition of a company that previously failed to properly report sales and use taxes to a collector. La. Admin.

La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.48(B); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:1562.B. A taxpayer has 30 days from the date of the notice of a proposed assessment to pay the additional tax, interest, and applicable penalties, request an extension of time to reply to the proposed assessment, or protest the proposed assessment. A protest must be in writing and should fully disclose the reasons, together with facts and figures, for objecting to the determination. The secretary will consider the protest and in their discretion may grant a hearing before making a final determination of tax, penalty, and interest due. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:1563; see Catahoula Par. Sch. Bd. v. La. Mach. Rentals, LLC, 124 So. 3d 1065 (La. 2013) and Wash. Par. Sheriff's Office v. La. Mach. Co., 126 So. 3d 1273 (La. 2013) (the tax collector has a duty to notify taxpayer of both the opportunity to protest and the 30 day period in which to do so. Failure to do so will toll the 30 day period). With respect to a local sales and use tax audit, a taxpayer may also protest a collector's determination of tax due. If the taxpayer failed to make and file a return or report, the taxpayer generally has 15 days to protest the determination from the date of notice provided. If the taxpayer did not correctly compute its tax liability, the taxpayer generally has 30 days to protest the determination from the date of the notice. In either case, the taxpayer must protest the collector's determination in writing, and the taxpayer must fully disclose the reasons (with substantiation) for objecting to the collector's determination. The collector will then consider the protest, grant a hearing, and make a final determination of tax, penalties, and/or interest due on the claim. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.49(A). The burden is on taxpayers to show that audit and assessment methods are improper. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.35; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.28; see Yesterdays of Lake Charles, Inc. v. Calcasieu Par. Sales & Use Tax Dept., 2016 BL 156215 (La. 2016) (taxpayer could not demonstrate that the methods used to calculate the additional assessment were improper, in light of the taxpayer's failure to keep accurate and suitable records); Barfield v. Diamond Constr. Inc., 2017 BL 111192 (La. Ct. App. 2017) (where taxpayer could not provide records to show which transactions are taxable, estimate used by Department of Revenue is allowed). Costs A taxpayer may be liable for the costs associated with an audit if the taxpayer:• fails to make any required return; • makes a grossly incorrect report; or • makes a false or fraudulent report. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.13.1; see Duncan Oil, Inc. v. Calcasieu Par. Sch. Bd., No. 17-488, 2018 BL 67349 (La. Ct.
