Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Real Property

Nontaxable The sales and use tax does not apply to transfers of real property. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-2(33)(A). Real property includes, but is not limited to, concrete slabs and foundations, and structures or fixtures used for general manufacturing plant ventilation, heating, cooling, illumination, communications, plumbing, or the personal comfort and convenience of the manufacturer's employees. Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-2-.62(3)(d)(1)(iii); see also Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-2-.03(5)(a)(1)(iii). Georgia imposes sales and use tax on retail sales of tangible personal property and certain services. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-30(a). Tangible personal property is personal property that can be seen, weighed, measured, felt, or touched, or that is perceptible to the senses. Real property is not included in the definition of tangible personal property and therefore is not subject to sales or use tax. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-2(11). “Real property” means land, buildings on land, and any fixtures attached to land. Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-2-.62(2)(l). BNA-SUTN GA 28.1.

Three-part test Generally, whether tangible property is a fixture and is exempt from tax or is taxable tangible personal property depends on whether its removal would cause significant damage to such property or to the real property to which it is attached. Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-2-.62(2)(d). The term “fixture”means tangible personal property that has been installed or attached to land or to any building thereon and that is intended to remain permanently in its place. Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-2-.62(2)(d). Fixtures typically include, but are not limited to, plumbing, lighting fixtures, slabs, and foundations. Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-2-.62(2)(d). See also Georgia Letter Ruling SUT 2014-16 (Oct. 7, 2014) (stating that a locker rental company's charges for the use of lockers are essentially storage charges and as such are not subject to Georgia's sales and use tax; also stating that the lockers are real fixtures and are classified as real property). Machinery that is moveable or not actually attached to the property remains personal property. Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-2-.62(2)(d). Furthermore, anything detached from the property becomes tangible personal property immediately. Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-2-.62(2)(d). Georgia's Three Factor Test Georgia courts have used three factors in analyzing whether an object is personal property or real property. Homac Inc. v. Fort Wayne Mortgage Co., 577 F. Supp. 1065, 1069 (N.D. Ga. 1983); Georgia Letter Ruling SUT-2012-09-18-01 (Sept. 18, 2012) (based on the manner and degree of affixation and the intent of the parties, cabinets constituted real property following installation). First Factor The courts look to the degree to which the object has become integrated with or attached to the land. Under Georgia law, if an article cannot be removed from the land without suffering essential injury, it is considered a fixture. Homac Inc. v. Fort Wayne Mortgage Co., 577 F. Supp. 1065, 1069 (N.D. Ga. 1983) (citing Wade v. Johnston, 25 Ga. 331, 336 (Ga. 1858). Second Factor A court must consider the intention of the parties regarding the status of the object. In re Janmar, Inc ., 4 B.R. 4, 9 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1979). An item will remain personal property if the parties define it as such under the terms of a contract, even if the item is permanently affixed to real property. In re Janmar, Inc., 4 B.R. 4, 9 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 1979). Third Factor The court determines whether there is unity of title between the personal property and the real property at the time the object allegedly became part of the land. Homac Inc. v. Ft. Wayne Mortgage Co., 577 F. Supp. 1065, 1070 (N.D. Ga. 1983) (citing Holland Furnace Co. v. Lowe, 159 S.E. 277 (Ga. 1931)). When the ownership of the land is in one person and the thing affixed to it is in another, and in its nature it is capable of severance without injury to the former, the fixture cannot, in contemplation of law, become a part of the land, but must necessarily remain distinct property to be used and dealt with as personal estate. Homac Inc. v. Ft. Wayne Mortgage Co., 577 F. Supp. 1065, 1070 (N.D. Ga. 1983) (citing Holland Furnace Co. v. Lowe, 159 S.E. 277 (Ga. 1931)). BNA-SUTN GA 28.2.1.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Construction Materials and Contracts Construction Materials and Contracts, Generally

Taxable A person contracting to furnish tangible personal property and to perform services under a contract is deemed the end user and consumer of the tangible personal property. The contractor is liable for the tax and must pay at the time of purchase, use, storage or consumption, whichever occurs first. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-63(b); Ga. Comp. R. & Regs. r. 560-12-2-.26(1). Additionally, in accordance with J.W. Meadors & Co. v. State, an international contractor whose relevant contracts are for work outside of the United States is the per se consumer of tangible personal property purchased in connection with performance of its contract. J.W. Meadors & Co. v. State (Ga. Ct. App. 1954). While Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-63 does not specifically address contracts performed internationally, nothing indicates that the statute was intended to limit Meadors. See J.W. Meadors & Co. v. State (Ga. Ct. App. 1954); see also Georgia Tax Tribunal Decision No. TAX-IIT-1340253 (Feb. 11, 2015) (denying claim for refund of state and local sales and use taxes by federal construction contractor with Georgia distribution facility on tangible personal property purchased both in and out of Georgia and shipped from Georgia overseas because contractor is deemed the consumer under Georgia law — sales tax is due on the property purchased in Georgia while use tax is due on the property purchased in interstate commerce and stored in Georgia). The Court of Appeals of Georgia further strengthened the contractor-as-consumer rule with their decisions in Inglett and Stubbs Int'l, Ltd v. Riley, when they held that a contractor was liable for sales and use tax on materials purchased and stored in Georgia and subsequently be shipped to Afghanistan. Inglett and Stubbs Int'l, Ltd. v. Riley, 2016 BL 354562 (Ga. Ct. App. 2016), cert. denied, 2017 BL 195313 (Ga. 2017). The contractor is also liable for the tax if the tangible personal property is provided by the party that is hiring him to perform the contract and that party fails to pay the sales or use tax. The contractor must pay a use tax based on the fair market value of the property regardless of whether any right, title, or interest in the property becomes vested in the contractor, if the person supplying the property has not paid sales or use tax on its purchase or use. Ga. Code Ann. §48-8-63(c). More information on the taxation of construction contractors is available at 1840 T.M., State Taxation of Construction Contractors. BNA-SUTN GA 28.3.1.
