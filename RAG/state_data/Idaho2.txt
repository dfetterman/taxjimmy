Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Civil Penalties

Yes The Idaho sales and use tax provisions contain civil penalties, as well as incorporate the income tax penalties under the Idaho Income Tax Act. Idaho Code §63-3634. A taxpayer who has repeatedly or intentionally made purchases claimed to be exempt that are in fact not exempt may face a penalty equal to the greater of 5 percent of the sales price of the property or $200. However, if the purchaser can present reasonable grounds that the purchase was exempt, the penalty may be abated. Idaho Code §63-3624(i). Persons who engage in business without a seller's permit is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed$100. Each day of operating the business without a permit is a separate offense. The State Tax Commission will provide written notice of the penalty and may assess the penalty as a deficiency. Idaho Code §63-3620(g). Any individual required to collect, account for and pay over any tax who willfully fails to carry out or execute his duty will be required to pay, in addition to the tax, penalty and interest, an additional amount equal to the total amount of tax involved. This penalty is in addition to all other penalties provided in Idaho Code §63-3624. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.118.02. If the taxpayer's negligence leads to a deficiency, then a 5 percent penalty of the total deficiency is added. However, interest is not imposed on the additional 5 percent assessment. Idaho Code §63-3634; Idaho Code §63-3046(a); Idaho Commission Decisions Docket No. 1-915-205-632 (Oct. 12, 2018) (where Audit Bureau had previously notified taxpayer twice of errors in its use tax liability payments and the taxpayer did not resolve the errors, negligence penalty imposition is appropriate). If the taxpayer has the intent to defraud or evade tax due to Idaho, an additional penalty of 50 percent of the total deficiency is assessed. Idaho Code §63-3634; Idaho Code §63-3046(b); see Idaho Commission Decision Docket No. 0-966-338-560 (Nov. 21, 2018) (where taxpayer's private statements, business and financial practices, and knowledge that collected tax was deliberately not remitted, fraud penalty is justified); Idaho Commission Decision Docket No. 26154 (Aug. 29, 2015); Idaho Commission Decision Docket No. 26155 (April 25, 2015) (The department imposed a 50 percent penalty on the taxpayer for attempting to evade tax, however, the penalty was abated due to insufficient evidence to support the penalty). The penalty is applied to the entire tax liability. Idaho Commission Decisions Docket No. 0-421-480-448 (Jan. 15, 2019). Any person who willfully assists or advises the preparation of a fraudulent return is guilty of a felony punishable by a fine up to $10,000 and/or imprisonment for not more than five years. Idaho Code §63-3634; Idaho Code §63-3075(c). The complaint must be filed within six years from the act or the offense. Idaho Code §63-3634; Idaho Code §63-3075(d). An understatement greater than 10 percent of the tax due under the return or $5,000 is a substantial understatement. A substantial understatement results in a 10 percent penalty of the amount of underpayment. Idaho Code §63-3634; Idaho Code §63-3046(d). BNA-SUTN ID 31.12.1.
