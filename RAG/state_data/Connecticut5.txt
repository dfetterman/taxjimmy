Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Real Property

Nontaxable While Connecticut imposes sales and use tax on retail sales of tangible personal property, the sale of real property is not subject to sales and use tax. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(13); Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-407(2)(i)(I)-1(b)(1). In Connecticut, “tangible personal property” means personal property that can be seen, weighed, measured, felt or touched or which is in any other manner perceptible to the senses, including canned or prewritten computer software. Tangible personal property includes the distribution, generation or transmission of electricity. Real property is defined as “property that is considered to be real property under the laws of the State of Connecticut.” Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-407(a)(13); Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-407(2)(i)(I)-1(b)(1); Connecticut Ruling 2007-3 (July 13, 2007). BNA-SUTN CT 28.1.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal General Rule for Classification

Nontaxable Fixtures that are not only annexed to real property, but also clearly a permanent addition to the real property intended to be made by the annexation of the tangible personal property, are not subject to tax. Connecticut Ruling 2007-3 (July 13, 2007). In so determining whether an annexation was intended to be a permanent accession to the real property, Connecticut law looks to:• the character of the annexation; • the nature and the adaptation of the article annexed to the uses and purposes to which that part of the building was appropriated at the time the annexation was made; and • the relation of the party making it to the property in question.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal Sale and Installation of Flooring and Window Treatments

Depends Whether the sale and installation of flooring and window treatments is taxable depends on the type of service provided. Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2018(2) (Dec. 19, 2018). The permanent installation of flooring such as wall-to-wall carpet, tile, linoleum, and wood is considered a service to real property; the contractor pays tax on the purchase of materials and collects tax on labor unless installed in new construction or owner-occupied residential property. A contractor performing nonpermanent installation of flooring is considered the retailer of the materials and must collect sales tax. Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2018(2) (Dec. 19, 2018); The installation of window treatments (such as interior shutters, curtains, blinds and shades)is not considered a service to real property. The sale of interior window treatments is taxable as a sale of tangible personal property. A separately stated charge for installing window treatments is not taxable. The sale and installation of flooring to existing commercial, industrial, or income-producing property is taxable, but is not taxable when rendered to owner-occupied residential property or new construction.

A contractor should not charge tax on the sale and installation of permanently installed signs when installed on new construction or owner-occupied residential property. A contractor must charge tax when permanently installing the sign on existing commercial property, existing industrial property, and existing income-producing property. Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2018(2) (Dec. 19, 2018). The contractor must pay tax on all purchases of materials used in the permanent installation of signage, including, but not limited to the sign, concrete, wiring, lumber, and building supplies regardless of the type of property to which the sign is affixed. Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2018(2) (Dec. 19, 2018). The sale of signs that are not permanently installed is taxable. Charges for the installation of signs that are not permanently installed are not taxable if separately stated. Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2018(2) (Dec. 19, 2018). Permanently installed signs are signs that become affixed to real property including, but not limited to electrically lighted signs bolted to the fronts of buildings, signs installed on concrete bases and poles, and construction of billboards.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Construction Materials and Contracts Construction Materials and Contracts, Generally

Taxable Equipment, Tools, and Supplies Contractors are the consumers of equipment, including rolling or movable equipment such as trucks, tractors, scaffolding, etc., tools and supplies such as pipe cutters, trowels, wrenches, oxygen, acetylene, gasoline, acid, and thread-cutting oil, which they use in their business and the tax applies to the sales or leases of such equipment, tools, and supplies to contractors. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-426-18(f). Solar Heating and Solar Electricity Generating Systems Connecticut exempts from sales and use tax sales and installation of solar energy electricity generating systems and passive or active solar water or space heating systems. Connecticut also exempts sales of geothermal resource systems. The exemption includes purchases by a property owner or by a contractor. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-412(117)(A); Connecticut Special Notice SN 2010(6); Connecticut Special Notice SN 2007(7). Residential Weatherization Products and Compact Fluorescent Light Bulbs Prior to Jan. 1, 2016, residential weatherization products and compact fluorescent light bulbs were exempt from Connecticut's sales and use tax. This exemption was repealed effective Jan. 1, 2016. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-412k(b), as repealed by 2015 Conn. S.B. 1601, effective Jan. 1, 2016; Connecticut Special Notice SN 2015(11). Eligible “residential weatherization products”included programmable thermostats, window film, caulking, window and door weather strips, insulation, water heater blankets, water heaters, natural gas and propane furnaces and boilers that meet the federal Energy Star standard, windows and doors that meet the federal Energy Star standard, oil furnaces and boilers that are not less than 84 percent efficient and ground-source heat pumps that meet the minimum federal energy efficiency rating. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-412k(a), as repealed by 2015 Conn. S.B. 1601, effective Jan. 1, 2016. Construction Materials A contractor must pay the sales tax on the purchase or lease of all materials, supplies, or equipment used by the contractor in fulfilling any construction contract except:• contracts where the contractor has agreed to sell materials or supplies at an agreed upon price, and to render services in connection with this agreement, charging for the additional service; Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2018(2) (Dec. 19, 2018); Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-426-18(b)(1). or • when the contractor is engaged in the business of selling such materials or supplies at retail. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-426-18(b)(2). In these circumstances, the contractor is considered a retailer and must give the person from whom the contractor is buying the materials or supplies a resale certificate, thus exempting the transaction from sales and use taxation. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-426-18(b). Contractor-Fabricated Articles There are circumstances where a contractor may fabricate some or all of the articles that the contractor uses in construction work. In this circumstance, the sale of the materials used in the fabrication constitutes a sale at retail, and the contractor must pay the sales tax as a consumer. This is true regardless of whether the articles fabricated are used in the alteration, repair, or reconstruction of an old building or are used in new construction work. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-426-18(d). Contractor Performing Taxable Services Where the contractor performs services taxable under §12-407(2) of the general statutes, the contractor is making a sale at retail, must register with the Commissioner of Revenue Services, and must collect the tax on that portion of the charge representing the taxable services. For this purpose, the charge for the service should be segregated on the invoice. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-426-18(g). Pay-When-Paid Method for Materialmen Connecticut allows materialmen to remit sales and use taxes on certain sales of building materials and services to real property “as and when” actually paid by the purchasers to whom they have extended credit. This is an exception to the general rule that requires sellers to remit the full amount of tax at the time of transaction. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-408(2)(C); Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2018(4)(Sept. 24, 2018). “Materialman” is defined as a person who furnishes building materials or services to a contractor for the construction, raising, removal, or repair of a building or the improvement of real property. To be considered a materialman, a person must also be entitled under Conn. Gen. Stat. §49-33 to file a mechanic's lien against the real property to ensure payment for the materials or services. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-408(2)(C); Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2018(4)(Sept. 24, 2018). “Building materials” means materials that are incorporated as an improvement or repair to real property. The term also includes tools and other items that are used to improve real property. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-408(2)(C); Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2018(4)(Sept. 24, 2018). “Contractor” includes a general contractor, a subcontractor, a repairman, and a property owner acting as his or her own general contractor. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-408(2)(C); Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2018(4)(Sept. 24, 2018). However, if a materialman does not collect the full tax on a transaction qualifying for pay-when-paid treatment within one year of the transaction date, the materialman must remit any remaining tax due on the full gross receipts (whether or not full payment for the tangible personal property or services has been received). Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2018(4)(Sept. 24, 2018). More information on the taxation of construction contractors is available at 1840 T.M., State Taxation of Construction Contractors.

In both residential and commercial construction contracts, contractors are considered the final consumer of materials used to complete construction contracts;thus, the customer is not liable to pay sales and use tax on materials purchased to complete a construction contract. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-407(2)(i)(I)-1(h)(1). The service provider must give a bill or invoice to the property owner that either separately states the charge for such services and the cost to such provider of such materials or supplies or, in the alternative, states only the total charge, including the charge for the services and the tax thereon, together with the words “tax included.” Conn.

If either of the exceptions apply, the contractor is a retailer and must provide a resale certificate bearing the contractor's permit number. The contractor must collect the tax from the person to whom the contractor sells the same. The contractor is strictly and solely accountable for collecting the sales tax involved and paying all taxes due. The contractor is strictly accountable for paying the use tax if the contractor makes any use of the property other than retention, demonstration or display while holding it for resale, or if the contractor makes purchases subject to the use tax.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Contractor Classifications

Yes Connecticut does not exempt sales contracts where a contractor or subcontractor acts as a retailer selling tangible personal property in the same manner as other retailers and must install a complete unit of standard equipment, requiring no further fabrication but simply installation, assembling, applying, or connecting services. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-426-18(e); Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2018(2) (Dec. 19, 2018). In such instances the contract will not be regarded as one for improving, altering, or repairing real property. A person performing such contracts is primarily a retailer of tangible personal property and should segregate the full retail selling price of such property from the charge for installation, as the tax applies only to the retail price of the property. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-426-18(e). Examples of situations in which a contractor or subcontractor acts as a retailer include situations where:• the retailer of an awning or blind agrees not only to sell it but to hang it; • an electrical shop sells electrical fixtures and installs them; • a retailer sells an electric washing machine and installs it; • a dealer sells cabinets and installs them; • the retailer of an awning or blind agrees not only to sell it but to hang it; • an electrical shop sells electrical fixtures and installs them; • a retailer sells an electric washing machine and installs it; or • a dealer sells cabinets and installs them. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-426-18(e). BNA-SUTN CT 28.5.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Subcontractors

Depends The taxability of contracts between contractors and subcontractors depends on the existence and acceptance of a resale certificate between the entities. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-407(2)(i)(I)-1(h)(2); Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2018(2) (Dec. 19, 2018). Specifically, if a construction contractor, in fulfilling a construction contract, purchases services to industrial, commercial, or income-producing real property from a construction subcontractor for resale to the property owner, and such subcontractor accepts a resale certificate from such contractor, then the cost of materials or supplies used by such subcontractor in fulfilling the subcontract may be taken into account by such contractor on the bill or invoice to the property owner as long as such subcontractor gives a bill or invoice to such contractor that separately states the charge for such services and the cost to such subcontractor of the materials or supplies considered to have been consumed in fulfilling the subcontract. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-407(2)(i)(I)-1(h)(2). “Subcontractor”means a person who is engaged in contracting real property work and who contracts with a prime or general contractor to perform all or any part of the contract of the prime or general contractor, or who contracts with a subcontractor who has contracted to perform any part of the contract entered into by the prime or general contractor. Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-430(7)(A)(v). BNA-SUTN CT 28.6.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Contracts with Exempt Entities

Nontaxable When a contractor enters into a construction contract with an exempt entity, the contractor is entitled to purchase the materials and supplies to be installed or placed in projects being completed under the construction contract without paying sales or use tax. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-426-18(c)(1). The installed or placed materials and supplies must remain in the projects after the contract's completion. The contractor is not allowed to charge the exempt entity any sales or use tax for the supplies and materials used. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-426-18(c)(1). A contractor's labor is not subject to tax when the service is rendered to: charitable or religious organizations; qualifying governmental agencies or their agents; real property owned by federally recognized Indian tribes when the service is performed in federally recognized Indian country;hospitals and certain other exempt entities. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-407(2)(i)(BB)1; Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2018(2) (Dec. 19, 2018). In such a transaction, if the contractor is unable to determine the exact amount of materials and supplies to be exempt from sales and use taxation, the contractor must estimate the amount of such purchases that shall be used in completing a construction contract for an exempt entity. The contractor becomes strictly accountable for any use tax that may become due because of the contractor's use of the purchased materials and supplies for uses other than for completing projects for an exempt entity. Conn. Agencies Regs. §12-426-18(c)(2). Contractors should use certificate CERT-141, Contractor's Exempt Purchase Certificate, to purchase materials for qualifying projects without paying sales tax. Connecticut Informational Publication IP 2018(2) (Dec. 19, 2018); Connecticut Announcement AN 2009(6) (April 28, 2009). BNA-SUTN CT 28.7.
