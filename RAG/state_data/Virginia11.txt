Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Sales Tax

Yes The sales tax in Virginia is a privilege tax imposed upon persons engaged in the business of selling at retail, distributing, renting, or furnishing tangible personal property in Virginia. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-603. Virginia levies and imposes sales tax upon persons engaged in the business of selling at retail, distributing, renting, or furnishing tangible personal property in Virginia in the amount of 4.3 percent:• of the gross sales price each item or article of tangible personal property when sold at retail or distributed in Virginia; • of the gross proceeds derived from the lease or rental of tangible personal property, where the lease or rental of such property is an established business, or part of an established business, or the same is incidental or germane to such business; • of the gross proceeds derived from the sale or charges for rooms, lodgings, or accommodations furnished to transients; and • of the gross sales of any services that are expressly stated as taxable. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-603. Sales and leases are presumed to be taxable until proven otherwise. The dealer must prove that the transaction is not taxable, unless the dealer receives an exemption certificate from the taxpayer. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-623(A); Va. Regs. §10-210-280. Although the seller is legally obligated to collect the tax from the purchaser, the legal incidence of the sales tax is on the purchaser. The tax is therefore a legal debt of the purchaser. United States v. Forst, 569 F.2d 811 (Va. 1978). As of July 1, 2013, an additional regional sales and use tax became effective for the Northern Virginia Region and the Hampton Roads Region.

The Hampton Roads Region is comprised of the counties of Isle of Wright, James City, Southampton, and York and the cities of Chesapeake, Franklin, Hampton, Newport News, Norfolk, Poquoson, Portsmouth, Suffolk, Virginia Beach, and Williamsburg.

Effective July 1, 2018, an additional 1 percent regional sales and use tax is imposed in the “Historic Triangle” region, which includes the city of Williamsburg, James City County, and York County.

See Williamsburg, Va. Code §17-09, 17-10, 18-237. This tax will expire if any locality within the “Historic Triangle”raises or reinstates any such tax before Jan. 1, 2026. Va.

The contractors' use tax is computed by allocating the original purchase price of the property over the duration of use in Virginia. “Use” is considered to include storage, consumption, and “stand-by” time. Therefore, the contractors' use tax is computed upon the relative amount of time equipment is in Virginia rather than upon actual use. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-604.1. Use tax is imposed upon the storage or use of all motor vehicles, machines, machinery, tools or other equipment brought, imported or caused to be brought into Virginia for use in constructing, building or repairing any building, highway, street, sidewalk, bridge, culvert, sewer or water system, drainage or dredging system, railway system, reservoir or dam, hydraulic or power plant, transmission line, tower, dock, wharf, excavation, grading, or other improvement or structure, or any part thereof.
