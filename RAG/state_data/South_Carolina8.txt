Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Food and Food Ingredients General Rule

Depends South Carolina law exempts “eligible food” from sales tax. Eligible food is unprepared food that can be purchased using food stamps under S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-2120(75). S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-2120(75); 117 S.C. Code Regs. §337. The exemption applies only to state-imposed sales tax, not to local sales tax. 117 S.C. Code Regs. §337. The determination as to whether a sale of unprepared food is exempt from the state sales and use tax is based on whether the food is of a type that is eligible to be purchased with USDA food stamps, the type of location selling the food, and whether the food is being sold for immediate consumption, business or institutional consumption, or home consumption. In other words, a food must be of a type eligible to be purchased with USDA food stamps and must also be sold for home consumption (based on the type of food and the type of location selling the food) to qualify. 117 S.C. Code Regs. §337; see also South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 16-8 (July 27, 2016) (exempting sales of vegetable seeds, fruit seeds, vegetable plants, and fruit plants to individuals to grow food in a home garden for personal use and consumption); South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 07-4 (Oct. 5, 2007), superseding South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 06-5 (Aug. 23, 2006).
