Topic: Administration and Procedure Agencies Responsible for Administration Local Sales and Use Tax

California Department of Tax and Fee Administration Effective July 1, 2017, the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration also administers and collects sales and use taxes on behalf of local jurisdictions. See, e.g., Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7202(d). Effective July 1, 2017, the California State Board of Equalization's(SBOE) jurisdiction over tax administration for sale and use tax was transferred to the Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA). See 2017 Cal. A.B. 102; 2017 Cal. A.B. 131. Both the Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax and the Transactions and Use (District)Tax require the locality imposing the tax to contract with the CDTFA to perform all functions incident to administration and collection of the tax. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7202(d); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7202(h)(4); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7204; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7204.3; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7212; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7270(a); Cal. Pub. Util. Code §180204(b);California Dept. of Tax and Fee Admin., Compliance Policy and Procedures Manual, Chapter 1. The CDTFA will administer these taxes in the same manner as the state sales and use taxes are administered, including the application of the voluntary disclosure programs and statute of limitations. Phone conversation with the California State Board of Equalization (Dec. 21, 2010). Generally, the retailer will collect both the Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax and the District Tax and pay it over to the CDTFA. In those situations where sales tax was not charged or the place of use has a higher rate, then the user of the property has the responsibility to pay the use tax on the property. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1803(c); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1827(a); California Tax Publication 44. For a more detailed discussion on who bears the burden of paying the taxes to the CDTFA, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at California 4.1. After receiving the funds, the CDTFA will remit the taxes to the local jurisdiction as promptly as feasible but at least twice per quarter. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7204; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7271. It should be noted that local jurisdictions are authorized to contract with each other to apportion local sales and use taxes imposed under the Bradley-Burns Local Sales and Use Tax Law. Cal. Const. art. XIII, § 29(b). BNA-SUTN CA 31.1.2.

Code § 6070.5, added by A.B. 1307, effective Jan. 1, 2012. The authorization will not apply if the licensee has entered into an installment payment agreement with the CDTFA and is in compliance with the agreement's terms. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6070.5, added by A.B. 1307, effective Jan. 1, 2012. Any person who engages in a business in California without a permit (or permits, if the person has more than one place of business) or after the permit is suspended or revoked, is guilty of a misdemeanor. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6071. Each officer of a corporation operating without a valid permit is also guilty of a misdemeanor. A permit is required for each place of business at which sales transactions are customarily negotiated with customers. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6066. No additional permit is needed at warehouses and other places where sales are not ordinarily made. If two or more activities, e.g., a restaurant and a service station, are conducted by the same person on the same premises, only one permit is required for both activities. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1699(a)(Permits). Sales of tangible property made on state designated fairgrounds, on or after July 1, 2018, must be separately accounted for on the taxpayer's sales and use tax return. California Dept. of Tax &Fee Admin., Temporary Sellers. The location of a computer server on which a Web site resides may not be issued a seller's permit unless the seller has a proprietary interest on the server and the activities at that location would otherwise qualify for a seller's permit. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1699(i). Retailers who provide space to a concessionaire are liable for tax incurred by the concessionaire unless the concessionaire obtains a seller's permit. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1699(d). If the retailer fails to make a return and pay tax with respect to the concession's activities, the concessionaire must obtain a permit and file returns with payment of any tax due. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1699(d). A special requirement that the CDTFA may impose on the operator of a swap meet or flea market, or special event, before the operator may be permitted to rent or lease space to a prospective seller, is that the operator obtain either written evidence that the seller is the holder of a valid permit or the seller's written statement that he or she is not offering any taxable item for sale or is otherwise not required to hold a valid seller's permit. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6073; California Tax Publication 111 - Feb. 2019. The terms “swap meet,” “flea market,” and “special event” are defined in Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6073(c) to include: (1) activity involving sales in sufficient number, scope, and character to constitute a regular course of business; or (2) any event at which two or more persons offer tangible personal property for sale or exchange and at which a fee is charged for the privilege of displaying property for sale or exchange or at which a fee is charged to prospective buyers for admission to the area where the property is offered or displayed for sale or exchange. The operator of a swap meet, flea market, or special event who (1) verifies that a seller holds a valid permit or obtains the required certificate from the seller that he or she is not offering any taxable item for sale and(2) completes the form requirements of Bus. & P. C. § 21663 will be deemed to have complied with the requirements of § 6073 and the CDTFA will not require any additional forms. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6073.1; California Tax Publication 111 - Feb. 2019. Certain events are excepted from the requirements of Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6073 on flea markets, swap meets, and special events. The exception includes trade shows and, when no tangible personal property is actually sold, events at which the exhibitors'contracts prohibit any sale of tangible personal property at the event or show and events conducted for informational or educational purposes. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6073.2. If agents make sales on behalf of a principal and do not have a fixed place of business but travel from place to place, each agent need not obtain a seller's permit if the principal obtains a permit for each place of business in California. If the principal does not do so, each agent must obtain a permit. Taxpayers are required to notify the board of a change in address so that the permit may be pursued without the filing of a new application. In addition, holders of sellers' permits must reregister with the CDTFA if any changes in composition of ownership or change in entity structure occurs. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6068. See California BOE Form 345, Notice of Business Change; California BOE Form 345-SP, Notice of Business Change—Special Taxes and Fees, Department Accounts. A sales tax return filed for a permitted location will not be deemed valid for a location that does not have a permit, with the consequence that a 10 percent failure-to-file penalty will be imposed on any unreported liability from sales made at unpermitted locations. For a detailed discussion on seller's permits and licensing requirements see Vendor/Seller Registration in Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at California 11.2. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §§ 6067 - 6071. An applicant for a sales tax permit must certify that it will actively engage in or conduct a business as a seller of tangible personal property. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6066; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6067. A penalty may be imposed if a resale certificate is issued for personal gain or to evade payment of taxes by a person not actively engaged in or conducting a business as a seller of tangible personal property. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6072; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6066.5. An agent for an unregistered out-of-state retailer is subject to sales tax on all sales made on behalf of the out-of-state retailer until the time the out-of-state retailer registers for tax. See California State Bd. of Equal. Sales Tax Counsel Rulings (Aug. 19, 1980), Bus. Taxes Law Guide ¶ 495.0790. The CDTFA is authorized to adopt rules and regulations that provide for a direct payment permit to a person who holds a valid seller's permit, if the CDTFA determines that such a direct payment permit would facilitate collection of the sales and use taxes. See Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 7051.1; see also Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1699.5, implementing Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 7051.1. In 1999 California enacted legislation providing that: 1. Cities and counties may collect information from persons desiring to engage in the business of selling tangible personal property in their jurisdictions and must submit that information to the Board of Equalization. Such information shall serve as a preliminary application for a seller's permit, and as notice to the Board for purposes of redistributing local tax under Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 7209. The Board must issue a determination regarding the issuance of a seller's permit within 30 days after receiving the local jurisdiction information if the determination can be made based on the information provided, or within 120 days if additional information is required. After consulting with the League of California Cities and the California State Association of Counties, the Board must adopt standardized addressing and naming conventions for registrants. 2. Cities and counties may require persons desiring to engage in the business of selling tangible personal property in its jurisdiction to provide their seller's permit account number, if any. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6066.3 and Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6066.4 enacted by A.B. 990, 1999 Cal. Stat. 908 effective from Jan. 1, 2000, to Jan. 1, 2004. Use Tax Registration Sellers Retailers doing business in California and making sales of tangible personal property, the storage, use, or other consumption of which is subject to use tax, must register with the CDTFA. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6226; see California Tax Publication 123 (discussing filing and reporting requirements for use tax). A retailer receiving rentals from a lease of tangible personal property located in California is deemed to be a retailer engaged in business in California and must collect tax when the rentals are paid by the lessee. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1684(a). Retailers who are not doing business in California may apply to the CDTFA for a “Certificate of Registration–Use Tax.” Holders of such certificates must collect tax from purchasers, give them receipts, and pay the tax to the CDTFA in the same manner as retailers doing business in California. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1684(b). Purchasers California requires “qualified purchasers” to register for use tax purposes. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6225. See California Tax Publication 164. A qualified purchaser is a person who meets the following conditions: Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6005. • receives at least$100,000 in gross receipts from business operations per calendar year. Note: Gross receipts are the total of all receipts from both in-state and out-of-state business operations. • is not required to hold a seller's permit or certificate of registration for use tax; • does not hold a use tax direct payment permit; • is not otherwise registered with the CDTFA to report use tax. California Tax Publication 126. See California Tax Publication 164. Taxpayers are required to notify the department of a change in address so that the permit may be pursued without the filing of a new application. In addition, holders of qualified purchaser permits must reregister with the CDTFA if any changes in composition of ownership or change in entity structure occurs. California CDTFA Form 345-QP, Qualified Purchaser - Registration Update. Planning Point: There is currently no statutory requirement to update qualified purchaser information, however the CDTFA implies it on the Qualified Purchaser Program registration website. Out-of-State Seller Registration Retailers based outside of California are required to pay sales and use tax on sales of merchandise to California customers if “engaged in business” within the state. If engaged in business in California, out-of-state sellers must also register with the CDTFA. Even if not engaged in business, an out-of-state business may voluntarily register with the CDTFA to collect and pay tax until the business closes out its certificate of registration. California Tax Publication 77; see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at California 3.1 for more information on what activities constitute being “engaged in business” with the state. Registration by Businesses Selling Products through the Internet Internet sales by businesses located in California are treated like sales done through other methods (purchases made in retail stores, through representatives, over the phone or by mail order). Therefore, internet sellers with a physical location in state must register with the CDTFA. California Tax Publication 109. If an internet seller's business is located outside of California, the sale of physical products to California locations is subject to use tax, and the seller must register to collect and pay tax if the seller has a permanent or temporary business location in state (warehouse, sales room, office, etc.), or has a representative or agent in state, even temporarily, and the agent makes sales, takes orders, installs/assembles merchandise, or makes deliveries. California Tax Publication 109. Revocation or Suspension of Permit The CDTFA is empowered to revoke or suspend the permit of a seller who violates any statutory provision or CDTFA rule or regulation regarding the sales tax. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6070. The CDTFA must give the permit holder ten days' written notice of the hearing to show cause why the permit should not be revoked. Security The CDTFA may in its discretion require security for the payment of any tax due or to be due. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6701. Under Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6701, the amount of security may not exceed the lesser of twice the estimated average liability of persons filing returns for quarterly periods or three times the estimated average liability of persons filing returns for monthly periods, or $10,000. Greater security may be required of any person who has been issued a notice of hearing to show cause why the permit should not be revoked. Failure to meet the requirements of correct and timely payment and reporting of tax may result in security being demanded to the maximum allowed by law. Failure to place security when demanded will result in revocation of the permit. The CDTFA may require security from new businesses or businesses being taken over by a new owner when security is deemed necessary for the protection of the state. In December 1991, the Board announced that new businesses would no longer be required to post security. News Release, NR No. 84–5, California State Bd. of Equal. (Dec. 13, 1991). Retailers with poor records of paying sales tax, however, may be required to post deposits. Deposits may be required for corporations, unless their owners agree to be personally responsible for sales tax liability. The CDTFA will issue a Notice of Security Requirements(BT–598), setting forth the amount and terms of the security required. The amount of security is determined by taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances, including the applicant's past experience, if any, with the CDTFA, the financial resources of the applicant, the kind of business, its location, the applicant's prior business history, and the success of any predecessor business. The applicant is allowed to select the type of security he or she prefers. Security is usually in the form of cash deposits, surety bonds, bearer bonds, savings and loan insured accounts, or certificates of deposit. Surety bonds are more likely to be used when a substantial amount of security is required. A preprinted form, Bond of Seller (BT–445), is executed in response to a demand for security under the California Sales and Use Tax Law. Security in the form of cash, government bonds, or insured deposits must be held by the board in trust, for use as specified under Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6701 or Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6815. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6701. The CDTFA's policy is to release security, except when it is required by law, if the Board determines that security is no longer required. A review is made after three years' operation, at which time the payment record, the type of ownership, the results of audits, current balance sheets, and other relevant considerations are examined. See Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6701. BNA-SUTN CA 31.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Tax Collection and Remittance

Seller Every retailer as defined under California's sales and use tax provision is responsible for the collection and/or payment of the correct amount of tax due. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6051; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6015. Because of administrative difficulties in collecting sales and use taxes from some vendors, the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration is expressly authorized to regard salespeople or other representatives as the agents of the persons under whom they operate or from whom they obtained the property sold by them. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6015(b); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1574. Effective July 1, 2017, the California State Board of Equalization's(SBOE) jurisdiction over tax administration for sale and use tax was transferred to the Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA). See 2017 Cal. A.B. 102; 2017 Cal. A.B. 131. The rule applies whether the salespeople are making sales on their own behalf or on behalf of the supplier. The CDTFA may regard the dealers, distributors, supervisors, or employers as retailers. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6015(b). In Sunshine Art Studios of Cal., Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal., Sunshine Art Studios of Cal., Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 114 Cal. Rptr. 24 (Cal. Ct. App. 1974). a corporation that distributed greeting cards to independent salespeople was held to be a retailer, even though it did not have an ownership interest in the cards that were acquired from its out-of-state parent corporation. In another example, a soft drink bottler was classified as a retailer and held liable for sales tax under Cal. Rev. &Tax. Code § 6015 and Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1574(a)(4) for sales to unreported vending machine operators who did not furnish resale certificates (these operators were classified agents of the bottler-“retailer”). Associated Beverage Co. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 224 Cal.App.3d 192, 273 Cal.Rptr. 639 (Cal. Ct. App. 1990). BNA-SUTN CA 31.3.1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Purchaser Liability

Depends The seller of tangible personal property—not the purchaser—is ultimately liable to pay the sales tax to the state. However, the seller can seek reimbursement from the purchaser. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6051. Additionally, every person storing, using, or otherwise consuming tangible personal property in California purchased from a retailer is liable for use tax. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6201; California Tax Publication 452. See also California Form CDTFA-403-CLW, California Use Tax Worksheet. BNA-SUTN CA 31.3.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Business Owners, Operators

Yes Any responsible person who willfully fails to pay an entity's sales and use tax will be personally liable for the tax. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1702.5(a), revised effective April 1, 2017. Only a “responsible person” may be held personally liable for the taxes owed by a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, or limited liability company. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1702.5(a), revised effective April 1, 2017. A “responsible person”is any officer, member, manager, employee, director, shareholder, partner, or other person having control or supervision of, or who is charged with the responsibility for, the filing of returns or the payment of tax or who has a duty to act for the corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, or limited liability company in complying with any provision of the Sales and Use Tax Law. The fact that a person possesses such a title does not, in and of itself, establish that the person is a “responsible person.” Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1702.5(b), revised effective April 1, 2017; see California State Bd. of Equal. v. Leal, 366 B.R. 77 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 2007) (nothing in Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6829 provided a shield against the joint and several liability of general partners for unpaid sales and use taxes, should they be found to be general partners. The statute was intended to provide the California State Board of Equalization with another tool to collect sales taxes from persons responsible for such collection and was not intended to protect partners from any joint and several liability they would otherwise have); see also Ilko v. California State Bd. of Equal., 651 F.3d 1049 (9th Cir. 2011) (holding that debtor's responsible person liability was not discharged in bankruptcy because debtor's liability for a corporation's unpaid sales taxes was a “tax” under Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6829). Responsible persons who leave a partnership should notify the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration immediately to prevent liability for future unpaid taxes and penalties. California Tax Publication 54. Effective July 1, 2017, the California State Board of Equalization's(SBOE) jurisdiction over tax administration for sale and use tax was transferred to the Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA). See 2017 Cal. A.B. 102; 2017 Cal. A.B. 131. Effective April 1, 2017 Effective April 1, 2017, a person willfully fails to pay when the failure is a result of a voluntary, conscious and intentional cause of action, and when the CDTFA establishes all of the following:• on or after the date that the taxes came due, the responsible person has an actual knowledge that the taxes were due, but not being paid; • the responsible person has the authority to pay the taxes or cause them to be paid on the due date or when person has actual knowledge; • when the responsible person has actual knowledge, such person has the ability to pay the taxes but chooses not to do so. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1702.5(b), revised effective April 1, 2017; see Cal. Off. of Admin. Law, OAL Matter Number 2016-1122-02; see In the Matter of the Appeal of Mohammad Bagher Bahour, OTA Case No. 18011877,(March 4, 2019) (an individual, as the sole officer, president, CEO and CFO of a corporation, was a responsible person liable for the corporation's unpaid sales and use tax liabilities despite alleged filing errors committed by the corporation's accountant).

Effective July 1, 2017, the California State Board of Equalization's (SBOE) jurisdiction over tax administration for sale and use tax was transferred to the Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA). See 2017 Cal. A.B. 102; 2017 Cal. A.B. 131. General Rule Individuals and businesses that are required to collect and remit sales and use tax must file return forms with the applicable tax due to the CDTFA. Any retailer that is required to hold a sale tax permit must file a sales tax return. The returns must be signed by the person filing the return, or by that person's duly authorized agent, when the tax returns are filed. Sales and use tax returns are filed online. Additionally, taxpayers that make taxable sales or taxable uses of tangible personal property in California must file a return. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6452. Reporting Intervals California requires most taxpayers to file sales and use tax returns on a quarterly basis. Returns must be filed on or before the last day of the month that follows the close of the preceding reporting period. Some taxpayers may be granted an extension to file. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6459. Use Tax Returns Individuals and businesses that purchase and consume non-exempt tangible personal property without otherwise paying sales tax to a retailer that is required to collect the tax, and also retailers that are required to collect use tax, must file use tax returns. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6452.1; California Tax Publication 123. Use tax is to be paid and reported on out-of-state purchases and on property withdrawn from resale inventory. California Tax Publication 388—June 2016; California Tax Publication 123. Individuals may pay estimated use tax on personal items purchased for less than $1,000 for non-business use from out-of-state retailers. This estimated use tax is reported on the taxpayer's individual income tax return and is based on the adjusted gross income reported. California Dept. of Tax &Fee Admin., Use Tax Table; California Tax Publication 123; see California SBOE News Release NR 10-16-G. Information Returns Information returns must be filed by all persons who solicit orders for the sale of tangible personal property if the storage, use, or other consumption of such property is subject to tax and if the seller does not hold a “Certificate of Registration—Use Tax” or a seller's permit. See Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 7055; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1687. The returns must state the name and address of each purchaser, description and sales price of property, dates of order, and delivery date to purchaser. No tax is paid with the information returns. The purpose of the information returns is to supply the CDTFA with information relative to persons who incur use tax liability. Information returns are due no later than the last day of the month following each calendar quarter. See Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1687 (Information Returns). Form BT–401–AC2 is the basic sales and use tax return that must, unless the CDTFA requires otherwise, be submitted to the CDTFA with the tax payment on or before the last day of the month following each quarterly period. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6451; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6452. A return must be filed even if no tax is due or if there have been no sales for the period. See Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6452. Another form of return is State, Local and District Sales and Use Tax Return (BT–401–C), which requires a detailed allocation by county and is required of certain specified classes of sellers, e.g., auctioneers, vending machine operators, out-of-state sellers who have no regular place of business in California. The appropriate form of return is sent to each seller by the CDTFA at the close of each reporting period. Forms may also be obtained from any office of the CDTFA. A return must be signed by the person required to file it or by a duly authorized agent. It need not be verified by oath. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6452. Form BT–401–E2 is the return filed by persons who are liable for use taxes and are not sellers of tangible personal property, when the use taxes are payable directly to the state. For example, this return would be filed by the purchaser of tangible personal property from a retailer who is not engaged in business in California and who does not hold a Certificate of Registration—Use Tax. The use of this return is discussed in paragraph 3 of the instructions for Form BT–401–E. The form may be obtained from any office of the CDTFA. Reporting Requirement for Sales on State-Designated Fairgrounds Effective July 1, 2018, retailers who make sales of tangible personal property on the real property of a California state-designated fair must separately state the amount of those sales on their sales and use tax returns; however, there is no additional tax or fee due on these sales. California CDTFA Special Notice L-549 (May 2018);California Dept. of Tax & Fee Admin., Reporting Requirement for Sales on State-Designated Fairgrounds; California Tax Publication 388–June 2018; California Publication 388—Sept. 2018; California Dept. of Tax & Fee Admin., Temporary Sellers.

Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1667(b)(1); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1668(d); see California Tax Publication 103. A seller may rebut this presumption by taking an exemption certificate that includes the following:• the date; • the purchaser's name and address; • the purchaser's seller's permit number or a note stating why the purchaser is not required to hold such a permit; • a description of the property purchased; • a statement of the manner in which or purpose for which the property will be used so as to qualify for exemption; and • the signature of the purchaser or of an agent or employee of the purchaser. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1667(a); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1667(c); California Tax Publication 103; California Tax Publication 73 (explaining that the certificate may be in any form, such as a note, letter, or memorandum).

Code Regs. tit. 18, §1667(c); California Tax Publication 73; California Tax Publication 103. Sellers may also be able to establish a sale for resale without a certificate by other evidence. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1668(e); In re SRN, Inc., California Office of Tax Appeals Decision No. 18011954 (Feb. 5, 2019). Consequences of Failing to Obtain Exemption Certificates If a purchaser knowingly issues a resale certificate when purchasing items that they will not resell, they will owe:• the amount of tax that would be due had the certificate not been used;and • interest on the tax due (computed from the time the item was purchased). In addition, the purchaser may have their seller's permit revoked and may be required to pay one or both of the following:• a penalty of 10 percent of the tax or $500, whichever is greater, for each purchase made for personal gain or to evade payment of tax; or • a 25 percent penalty for fraud or intent to evade the tax.

Accepted Border States Uniform Sales for Resale Certificate California accepts the Border States Uniform Sales for Resale Certificate. California Tax Publication 32. The four border states of Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas, together with the United Mexican States, formed the Border States Caucus to create programs for promoting trade. One outcome of this has been the creation of the Border States Uniform Sales for Resale Certificate. A seller with this certificate from northern Mexico or any of the four border states can submit the certificate to purchase goods that will be transported across state or national borders exempt for resale. The certificate is used in the same manner as a standard resale certificate. California Tax Publication 32. BNA-SUTN CA 31.8.3.3.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Good Faith Requirement

Yes Resale and exemption certificates furnished to a seller will only relieve the seller from liability for tax on sales to which such certificates relate when the certificates are accepted in good faith by the seller. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1667(b)(1); see California Tax Publication 103. If a purchaser timely certifies in writing that the property purchased will be used in an exempt manner or for an exempt purpose and the seller accepts that certificate in good faith, the seller is relieved of liability for the sales tax on the sale. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1667(b)(1); see California Tax Publication 103. BNA-SUTN CA 31.8.4.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Timely Acceptance

Prior to Delivery The acceptance of an exemption certificate, for resale or otherwise, will be considered timely if it is given at any time before the seller bills the purchaser for the property, or any time within the seller's normal billing and payment cycle, or any time at or before delivery of the property to the purchaser. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1667(b)(1); California Tax Publication 103. In the event a purchaser certifies in writing that the property purchased qualified for an exemption from the sales tax when in fact it does not, the purchaser will be liable for payment of sales tax as if the purchaser were a retailer making a sale. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1667(b)(3); California Tax Publication 103. The sale is deemed to occur at the time the property no longer qualifies for exemption and the sales price of the property to the purchaser is deemed the gross receipts from such sale. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1667(b)(3); California Tax Publication 103. The seller should note whether the property being purchased fits the general character of the purchaser's business. If the property would not normally be resold by the purchaser based on the nature of the purchaser's business, then the seller should not accept the resale certificate.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Direct Pay Permits

Authorized An application for a direct payment permit must be in writing and provide information which supports the claim that the applicant meets the requirements for a permit. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1699.5(c); see California Tax Publication 123 (discussing registration requirements for businesses). The application must include a certified financial statement and a detailed description of the information processing system which will be used to account for the tax liabilities assumed and allocate the local taxes involved. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1699.5(c). A “direct payment permit” is a permit issued by the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration which allows the holder to purchase tangible personal property for use without paying tax or tax reimbursement to the retailer from whom the purchase is made, and which relieves that retailer from liability for tax on the transaction provided that the retailer obtains an exemption certificate as provided herein from the purchaser. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1699.5(a). Effective July 1, 2017, the California State Board of Equalization's(SBOE) jurisdiction over tax administration for sale and use tax was transferred to the Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA). See 2017 Cal. A.B. 102; 2017 Cal. A.B. 131. The regulations require that the CDTFA notify an applicant, in writing, within 30 days of receiving a direct payment permit application either that the application is complete and has been accepted, or that the application is deficient and what additional specific information is required to make the application complete. Within 60 days of acceptance of a complete application the CDTFA shall approve or deny the issuance of a direct payment permit and notify the applicant in writing of its decision. Use Tax Persons seeking to pay use taxes directly to the board must file an application for a use tax direct payment permit. An application for a use tax direct payment permit should be made on Board of Equalization Form BOE-400-DP (no revision date). If the applicant is a natural person, the application should be signed by the owner. If the applicant is an association or partnership, the application is signed by a member or partner. For a corporation, the application is signed by an executive officer or some person specifically authorized by the corporation to sign the application. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1699.6(b); see California Tax Publication 123. The regulations require that the CDTFA notify an applicant, in writing, within 30 days of receiving a direct payment permit application either that the application is complete and has been accepted, or that the application is deficient and what additional specific information is required to make the application complete. Within 60 days of acceptance of a complete application the CDTFA shall approve or deny the issuance of a direct payment permit and notify the applicant in writing of its decision. Requirements for a Permit The following requirements must be satisfied for a direct pay permit to be issued:• the applicant must hold a valid seller's permit; • the applicant must agree to report and pay directly to the CDTFA all tax liabilities which are transferred from retailers to the applicant as a result of exemption certificates; • the CDTFA must determines that issuance of the direct payment permit will facilitate the collection of the tax; • the CDTFA must determine that issuance of the direct payment permit is to the mutual convenience of the CDTFA, the applicant, and the retailers whose tax liability will be reported and paid by the applicant; and • the applicant must have a record of timely payment of tax liabilities and is in such financial condition that issuance of the direct payment permit will not result in a tax loss to the state. Cal Rev. & Tax. Code §7051.1; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1699.5(b); see California Tax Publication 123 (discussing registration requirements for businesses). Restrictions on Government Entities There are certain restrictions when the applicant is a government entity or if the applicant has gross receipts of less than $75 million or purchases subject to sales or use tax of less than $75 million. Prepayment Requirements The holder of a direct payment permit must make prepayments on the tax, but the due date of these prepayments is five days before traditional due date. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1699.5(f). Returns A holder of either a sales or use tax direct payment permit must file a return with the CDTFA on or before the last day of the month following each quarterly period. The person required to file the return shall deliver it together with any amounts to be remitted for the tax. The return must show the aggregate gross receipts and liabilities that the retailer has assumed responsibility for during the reporting period. In addition, the return must also include any other information that the CDTFA may require. This return is separate from, and in addition, to any returns required to be filed by the person to report his or her own sales and use tax liabilities. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1699.5(e); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1699.6(e); see California Tax Publication 123 (discussing return requirements for businesses). Penalties If a holder of a direct payment permit fails or refuses to pay that retailer's tax liability to the board on a timely basis, then in addition to that retailer's tax liability, the direct payment permit-holder is subject to the same penalty provisions that would apply if that permit holder was the retailer. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7051.2. In general, any taxpayer who knowingly collects sales tax reimbursement or use tax and who fails to timely remit such sales tax reimbursement or use tax to the CDTFA, will be liable for a penalty equal to 40 percent of the amount not timely remitted. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6597(a)(1). However, this penalty does not apply where the taxpayer's liability for unremitted sales or use tax does not exceed the greater of an average of $1,000 per month or 5 percent of the total tax liability for which the tax reimbursement was collected for the period in which the tax was due. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6597(a)(2)(A). Additionally, if a taxpayer's failure to make a timely remittance of sales tax reimbursement or use tax is due to a reasonable cause or circumstances beyond the taxpayer's control, and occurred despite the taxpayer's exercise of ordinary care and the absence of willful neglect, the 40 percent penalty will not apply. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6597(a)(2)(B). Other penalties for failure to properly pay tax are found in Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7051.2. Revocation Sales Tax The CDTFA may revoke any direct pay permit if it determines that the holder no longer meets the requirements for the permit. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1699.5(d). Use Tax The CDTFA may revoke the use tax direct payment permit of any person who fails to purchase at least $500,000 per year of tangible personal property for own use. The permit shall remain valid for all transactions taking place before the date the permit is revoked. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1699.6(h). BNA-SUTN CA 31.8.10.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Record-Keeping Requirements

4 Years California requires individuals and businesses making taxable sales to keep and preserve suitable records of the proceeds of sales or gross receipts of sales for at least four years. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7053; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1698(b); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1698(i); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1698(k); California Tax Publication 116. Records must be kept to verify the accuracy of sales and use tax returns and to determine whether tax is due if a return has not been filed. The records must include any books or other accounts that may be necessary to determine the amount of tax for which the taxpayer is liable. Other examples are bills, receipts, invoices, job orders, exemption certificates, contracts and any other schedule or working papers used to prepare tax returns. The records should show gross receipts from all sales or leases or tangible personal property including exemptions, all deductions, and the total purchase price of all tangible personal property, purchased for sale, consumption, or lease. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7053; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1698(b); California Tax Publication 116; California Tax Publication 73; see also In the Matter of the Appeal of Sonic Lighting, Inc., OTA Case No. 18011878 (March 6, 2019) (a claim for exempt sales in interstate commerce and for resale must be supported by proper taxpayer documentation). All records must be retained for at least four years unless, the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration authorizes the destruction of records in writing. However, records relating to reporting periods before Jan. 1, 2003, must be retained for at least 10 years. Failure to maintain proper records required under the tax code will be considered evidence of negligence or intent to evade the tax and may result in penalties or other administrative action. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1698(i); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1698(k); California Tax Publication 116. Effective July 1, 2017, the California State Board of Equalization's(SBOE) jurisdiction over tax administration for sale and use tax was transferred to the Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA). See 2017 Cal. A.B. 102; 2017 Cal. A.B. 131. Electronic Records Electronic records are valid records under the California record-keeping statutes. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1698(b)(2), amended effective Oct. 1, 2016 (replacing the term “machine-sensible”with “electronic”). Electronic records are a collection of related information in an electronic format and do not include hardcopy records that are created or recorded on paper or stored in or by a storage-only imaging system such as microfilm or microfiche. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1698(a)(4), amended effective Oct. 1, 2016 (replacing the term “machine-sensible”with “electronic”). Electronic records must contain sufficient transactional-level information in order to satisfy California record-keeping requirements. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1698(c), amended effective Oct. 1, 2016 (replacing the term “machine-sensible”with “electronic”). Additionally, taxpayers may use their own discretion to discard duplicate or redundant information contained in electronic form. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1698(c). It is illegal to knowingly sell, purchase, install, transfer, or possess software or devices which hide or remove sales from records. California Tax Publication 116. Used Car Dealer Recordkeeping Requirements Used car dealers selling, leasing or using personal property in California generally are required to keep records demonstrating vehicles sales and tax due for at least four years. Examples of records that should be retained include books of account, bills, receipts, invoices, schedules and working papers used for tax preparation, and all DMV Report of Sale — Used Vehicle (REG 51) forms issued.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Refunds

Vendor Claims for refund must be in writing using Form CDTFA-101 or through a letter. California Tax Publication 117;California Dept. of Tax and Fee Admin., CDTFA-101 Claim for Refund or Credit. The filing deadline for a refund claim is the last of the following:• three years from the date of the return on which there was overpayment (payment to the DMV is deemed to be the filing of a return); • six months from the date of overpayment; • six months from the date a determination (billing) became final; • three years from the date the CDTFA collected an involuntary payment, such as from a levy or lien. California Tax Publication 117. The claim must be signed, dated and include:• the specific reason for overpayment; • the amount of overpayment;and • the periods for which overpayments were made. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6904; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §5231; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §5232; California Tax Publication 117. A claim for refund must be filed in any case in which a suit for refund will be brought, because filing the claim is necessary to exhaust administrative remedies. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6905; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6932; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §5232. The grounds set forth in the claim for refund must be drafted with care because they limit the grounds on which a suit may be maintained. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6933. This rule is strictly enforced. In A&M Records, Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal., the taxpayer did not discover that no taxable use was made in California of property purchased out-of-state until after a suit for refund had already been filed and the statute of limitations had run on a claim for refund, but the taxpayer was precluded from proving that fact. Before trial the Board agreed to consider the new evidence although it had no duty to do so, but indicated that if it found the evidence insufficient, it would take the position at trial that the taxpayer had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies by failing to state the issue in its claim for refund. A&M Records, Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 250 Cal. Rptr. 915 (Cal. Ct. App. 1988). For a discussion of the necessity to exhaust administrative remedies, see Barnes v. California State Bd. of Equal., 173 Cal. Rptr. 742 (Cal. Ct. App. 1981), Atari, Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 216 Cal. Rptr. 267, 170 Cal. App. 3d 665 (Cal. Ct. App. 1985), and Duffy v. California State Bd. of Equal., 152 Cal. App. 3d 1156, 199 Cal. Rptr. 886 (Cal. Ct. App. 1984). For sales and use tax refund claims made on or after Jan. 1, 2017, taxpayers making installment payments on a final notice of determination that they wish to dispute can make one timely claim for refund that will cover all future payments applied to that billing as well as any previous payments that are within the applicable statute of limitations period. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6902.6, as added by 2016 Cal. A.B. 1856, effective Jan. 1, 2017; California SBOE Special Notice L-479 (Nov. 2016). In the usual case when several taxable periods are included in a single audit and Notice of Determination, a claim for refund should be filed along with a Petition for Redetermination in all cases in which, under any conceivable theory, a refund might be due for one or more periods. Otherwise, by the time the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration acts on the Petition for Redetermination, time to file claims on new matters for the taxable periods covered by the Notice of Determination may well have elapsed. See Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6702. Effective July 1, 2017, the California State Board of Equalization's(SBOE) jurisdiction over tax administration for sale and use tax was transferred to the Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA). See 2017 Cal. A.B. 102; 2017 Cal. A.B. 131. For example, if the CDTFA's determination has the incidental effect of shifting a taxable transaction from one period to another, the Notice of Determination will reflect a credit for one period and an increase in tax for another period. Because the measure of taxable sales is not changed by this adjustment, the matter will rarely be protested, and attention will be focused on other issues. If a claim for the period for which the credit is proposed is not filed, the taxpayer may be charged with a tax on the second period, but not given credit for the first payment. See Holland Furnace Co. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 2 Cal. Rptr. 606 (Cal. Ct. App. 1960). A possible alternative to filing a protective claim for refund along with the Petition for Redetermination may be to request that the CDTFA consent to an extension of the time within which deficiencies may be determined and refunds claimed. This procedure may be risky, because statutory authority exists only to waive the time within which deficiency determinations may be issued and the CDTFA may decline to extend the time in which claims for refund may be filed. See Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6488. A claim for refund filed for or on behalf of a class of taxpayers must be accompanied by written authorization from each taxpayer sought to be included in the class. The authorization must be signed by each taxpayer or taxpayer's authorized representative and must state the specific grounds on which the claim is founded. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6901.5, 6904; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §5239. If the CDTFA refunds to a retailer an amount representing sales tax reimbursement that the retailer over-collected from customers, the retailer must in turn refund this amount to its customers. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6901.5; Loeffler v. Target Corp., 58 Cal.4th 1081, 324 P.3d 50 (Cal. 2014). However, customers generally may not themselves seek such a refund directly from the CDTFA or bring a consumer protection action against a retailer for over-collecting tax. See Loeffler v. Target Corp., 58 Cal.4th 1081, 324 P.3d 50 (Cal. 2014). Payment of accrued interest is not a necessary precondition for review by the CDTFA of a refund claim on an alleged overpayment of sales or use taxes. Agnew v. California State Bd. of Equal., 134 Cal. App. 4th 899 (Cal. Ct. App. 2005); see Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6931; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6932. Suit for Refund A suit for refund must be commenced within 90 days after the notice of the CDTFA's action on the claim is mailed. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6933. If the CDTFA fails to act on the claim within six months, the taxpayer may consider the claim denied and commence an action for refund. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6934. The suit for refund should be filed in the superior court (regardless of the amount) in the county where the attorney general has an office, i.e., Sacramento, San Francisco, San Diego, or Los Angeles. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6933. Suits may not be brought for injunction against collection of taxes. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6931; see Helms Bakeries v. California State Bd. of Equal., 128 P.2d 167 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1942), cert. denied, 318 U.S. 756 (1943). A suit for refund is ordinarily considered to be an exclusive remedy. See Casey v. Bonelli, 93 Cal. App. 2d 253, 208 P.2d 723 (Cal. Ct. App. 1949). The refund action is heard de novo and does not constitute an appeal from the CDTFA. Marchica v. California State Bd. of Equal., 107 Cal.App.2d 501, 237 P.2d 725 (Cal. Ct. App. 1951). In appropriate cases, purchasers may file a class action lawsuit to have over-collected sales tax refunded to them. See Javor v. California State Bd. of Equal., 141 Cal. Rptr. 226, 73 Cal. App. 3d 939 (Cal. Ct. App. 1977). However, this remedy is “limited to the unique circumstances where the [purchasers'] allegations show that the state has been unjustly enriched by the overpayment of sales tax, and the [CDTFA] concurs that the circumstances warrant refunds to consumers.” Littlejohn v. Costco, No. A144440, 2018 BL 249777 (Cal. Ct. App. July 13, 2018), modified 2018 BL 277184 (Cal. Ct. App. Aug. 3, 2018). In McClain v. Sav-On Drugs, customers who purchased skin puncture lancets and glucose test strips from pharmacies and were charged a sales tax reimbursement even though these items are exempt from sales tax if furnished by a registered pharmacist and used by a diabetic patient per Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1591.1(b)(5), filed a class action seeking to compel the pharmacies to file an administrative claim for refund with the Franchise Tax Board. On appeal from the trial court, the appellate court concluded that the customers had not met the standard needed for a California court to create a tax refund remedy outside of the processes already put in place by the legislature. A court can create a new tax refund remedy only if the following are true: (1) those seeking the refund remedy have no statutory tax refund remedy available to them; (2) the tax refund remedy being sought is not inconsistent with existing tax refund remedies; and(3) the board has already determined that those seeking the tax refund remedy are entitled to the refund and that not creating a remedy will unjustly enrich the taxpayer or the board. The court wrote that while customers can not file a direct refund claim because they are not the taxpayer, they had other remedies available to them including urging the board to audit the pharmacies' sales tax collection practices. The court further stated that because the board has not determined that a refund is actually due, allowing the customers to sue the pharmacies and the board for a refund would be contrary to state law. McClain v. Sav-On Drugs, 2017 BL 77430 (Cal. Ct. App. 2017), modified 2017 BL 116831 (Cal. Ct. App. 2017), aff'd 2019 BL 71395 (Cal. Mar. 4, 2019). The continued validity of Javor, which permitted a class action to refund excess sales and use taxes paid on the sale of new motor vehicles, was earlier put in doubt by Woosley v. State, in which the court declined to permit a class action brought to obtain a refund of excess vehicle license fees and use taxes. The court held that the procedure for obtaining a refund of excessive license fees was controlled by Veh. C. § 42231, which requires that a person or his agent file a claim for the refund. A class was not an agent within the meaning of the statute. With respect to the use tax, the court held that Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6486 required the State Board of Equalization to give notice of a denial of a claim to individuals and that there was no provision for delivering such notice to a class representative. The thrust of the court's opinion was that class claims would be permitted in tax refund cases only if specifically authorized by statute. The court disapproved of the holding of the court of appeal in Javor on remand although that case did not deal with the validity of the class action. The court said nothing of its own holding in Javor approving class actions. Woosley v. State, 3 Cal. 4th 758, 838 P.2d 758 (Cal. 1992); see Javor v. California State Bd. of Equal., 141 Cal. Rptr. 226, 73 Cal. App. 3d 939 (Cal. Ct. App. 1977). Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6904, amended to permit class claims after Woosley filed his claim, expressly permits class claims but requires each member of the class to authorize his or her inclusion in the class and sign the claim. But see California State Bd. of Equal. v. Superior Court of Sacramento County, 111 Cal. App. 3d 568, 169 Cal. Rptr. 3 (Cal. Ct. App. 1980) for an illustration of the courts' response to suits brought by other than taxpayers. The burden of proof in a suit for refund is on the petitioner. Riley B's, Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 132 Cal. Rptr. 520 (Cal. Ct. App. 1976). A suit for refund may not be brought on a partial payment of tax liability. See California State Bd. of Equal. v. Superior Court, See California State Bd. of Equal. v. Superior Court, 39 Cal. 3d 633, 643 n10, 217 Cal. Rptr. 238, 243 n10 (Cal. 1985); see also Milton McKenzie Investment Corp. v. California State Bd. of Equal., No. A104359 (Cal. Ct. App. Jan. 27, 2005)(to file suit, the taxpayer must pay the entire amount of the disputed tax even though the deficiency notice came after the taxpayer filed a claim for refund). disapproving of some of the language to the contrary in Snoozie Shaving, Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal.. Snoozie Shaving, Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 158 Cal. Rptr. 866, 97 Cal. App. 3d 771 (Cal. Ct. App. 1979). and Schaffer v. California State Bd. of Equal., Schaffer v. California State Bd. of Equal., 109 Cal. App. 2d 574, 241 P.2d 46 (Cal. Ct. App. 1952). However, the court expressly stated that a taxpayer might agree with the Board to a partial or installment payment procedure. See Chahine v. California State Bd. of Equal., 272 Cal.Rptr. 56, 222 Cal.App.3d 485 (Cal. Ct. App. 1990) holding that a claim for refund brought after a series of installment payments of tax liability had been made was timely only with respect to payments made within six months of filing the claim. In American Hospital Supply Corp. v. California State Bd. of Equal., American Hospital Supply Corp. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 169 Cal. App. 3d 1088, 215 Cal. Rptr. 744 (Cal. Ct. App. 1985). the court treated a sales tax counsel ruling as a ruling of general application entitled to great weight and a presumption of correctness, rather than a recitation of the Board's litigating position, distinguishing Culligan Water Conditioning v. California State Bd. of Equal.. Culligan Water Conditioning v. California State Bd. of Equal., 17 Cal. 3d 86, 550 P.2d 593 (Cal. 1976). Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 7277 specifies procedures for filing a claim for a refund of a tax that is found to be unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction. In Cod Gas &Oil Co. Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal., Cod Gas & Oil Co. Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 59 Cal.App.4th 756, 69 Cal.Rptr.2d 366 (Cal. Ct. App. 1997). gasoline retailers sought a refund of supplemental county gasoline taxes that were found to be unconstitutional. The retailers' fuel pumps carried posted notices indicating that the price included all sales taxes. The California Court of Appeal denied the retailers' claims because § 7277 excludes retailers from the category of “persons” entitled to claims such refunds. The court determined that the posted notices created a presumption that the retailers were reimbursed for the sales tax. The court also said that the statutory refund scheme was intended to facilitate the refund of unconstitutional taxes to purchasers, who bore the economic burden of the tax. Taxpayers seeking a refund are not required to pay accrued interest on a tax deficiency in addition to the tax assessed. In Agnew v. California State Bd. of Equal., 134 Cal. App. 4th 899 (Cal. Ct. App. 2005). the California Court of Appeal held that payment of accrued interest was not a necessary precondition for review by the State Board of Equalization of a refund claim on an alleged overpayment of sales or use taxes. Without paying the interest due on the tax, the taxpayer sued for a refund. The taxpayer argued that the Board's policy of requiring taxpayers to pay interest as well as the tax before filing a refund claim violated state law and the state constitution. The court agreed, explaining that Cal Rev. & Tax. Code § 6931 and Cal Rev. & Tax. Code § 6932 do not expressly require payment of the accrued interest as well as the assessed tax as a precondition for filing a valid claim for refund. A suit for refund is ordinarily considered to be an exclusive remedy. See Casey v. Bonelli, 93 Cal. App. 2d 253, 208 P.2d 723 (Cal. Ct. App. 1949). A claim for refund must be filed in any case in which a suit for refund will be brought because filing the claim is necessary to exhaust administrative remedies. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6905; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6932; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §5232. The refund action is heard de novo and does not constitute an appeal from the CDTFA. Marchica v. California State Bd. of Equal., 107 Cal.App.2d 501, 237 P.2d 725 (Cal. Ct. App. 1951). Claims for Refund Claim for Refund or Credit for Tax Paid to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) When individuals register a vehicle after a sale between private parties (not through a registered dealer), the California DMV will calculate the use tax due on the transaction based on the address of the vehicle. If the address is based on a zip code that crosses a city or county border, the wrong tax rate may be applied. Taxpayers that may encounter this situation have two options:(1) Pay the correct tax at a CDTFA field office and obtain a tax clearance before registering the vehicle; or (2) Pay the tax charged by the DMV at the time of vehicle registration, and then file a claim for refund by submitting Form BOE-101-DMV, Claim for Refund or Credit for Tax Paid to DMV, along with supporting documentation. California Tax Publication 117. Claim for California Film and Television Tax Credits The California Film Commission administers the California Film and Television Tax Credit Program. For taxable years beginning on or after Jan. 1, 2016, a New Film and TV Tax Credit Program has been established. The Film and TV Credit Program allows a tax credit against income or sales and use tax liabilities for qualified taxpayers who have been issued a certified Tax Credit Certificate. The credit applies to qualified expenditures for film and television shows produced in California. Qualified taxpayers, or their affiliates who have been assigned unused credits, may qualify to use credits to obtain a refund of qualified sales and use taxes by making an irrevocable election to apply the tax credit to sales and use tax liabilities. Assignees must have been assigned the tax credit on their California income or franchise tax return before making the election. The California Franchise Tax Board administers the rules for assigning credits. To file a refund claim, taxpayers must complete Form BOE-318, Claim for Refund and Irrevocable Election to Apply Credits Against Qualified Sales and Use Tax. California SBOE Special Notice L-404. In order to provide more opportunities for feature film applicants, the California Film Commission is adding an application window for the 2017-18 fiscal year in October and moving the third allocation period from January 2018 to March 2018. California Film Commission, Production Alert. Refund Claims for Use Fuel Tax For use fuel tax refund claims made on or after Jan. 1, 2017, claims that would otherwise be valid under Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §§ 9152 or 9153 that are made in cases where the amount of tax determined has not been paid in full are deemed to be timely filed claims with respect all subsequent payments applied to that determination.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Statute of Limitations Refund Requests

3 Years There is a three-year limitations period for filing a refund claim in California. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6902. A claim for refund of sales and use tax already paid may be made in writing within: • three years from the last day of the month following the close of the quarterly period for which the overpayment was made, or, • if overpayment was made as a result of the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration's determination, within: ○ six months from the date the determination becomes final, or ○ six months from the date of overpayment, whichever period expires later:or • three years from the date the state collected an involuntary payment, such as a lien or levy. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6902(a); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6904; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §5231; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §5232; California Tax Publication 117. Effective July 1, 2017, the California State Board of Equalization's(SBOE) jurisdiction over tax administration for sale and use tax was transferred to the Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA). See 2017 Cal. A.B. 102; 2017 Cal. A.B. 131. The limitations period for filing refund claims is suspended during a period in which a person is “financially disabled.” Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6902.4. BNA-SUTN CA 31.11.1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Statute of Limitations Assessment of Additional Tax

3 Years For returns filed quarterly, a notice of deficiency must either be sent to the taxpayer within three years after the later of the date the return was filed, or the last day of the month following the period for which the amount is proposed to be determined. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6487(a). For returns filed annually, a notice of deficiency must be mailed within three years after the later of:• the date on which the return was filed, or • the end of the calendar month following the one-year reporting period. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6487(b). Failure to File a Return If no return has been filed the limitation period is extended and the notice of deficiency must be sent to the taxpayer within eight years after the last day of the calendar month following the quarterly period for which the amount is proposed to be determined. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6487. False or Fraudulent Returns There is no statute of limitations if the taxpayer filed a false or fraudulent return. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6487. A penalty of 25 percent applies to any deficiency due to fraud. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6485. See generally California Tax Publication 178. BNA-SUTN CA 31.11.2.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Civil Penalties

Yes California imposes civil penalties for failure to timely file and pay sales and use tax, failure to remit tax that has been collected, wrongful use of a resale certificate, and several other reasons. California Tax Publication 75. A collection cost recovery fee (CRF) is imposed on past due liabilities to recover costs incurred in obtaining payment of past due amounts greater than $250. The CRF may be assessed if the taxpayer: 1) does not pay the full amount due with 90 days after the issuance of a demand notice; or 2) does not timely enter into a payment plan and successfully complete the terms of the agreement. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6833; California Tax Publication 75. Late Tax Return Filings and Payments Persons who fail to file a tax return are subject to a penalty of 10 percent. Persons who fail to make a tax payment on time are also subject to a 10 percent penalty. However, if the return and payment are both late, the penalty is limited to 10 percent. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6591; California Tax Publication 73; California Tax Publication 75. Late Prepayment Persons who make a prepayment after the due date for prepayment but before the normal date for the quarterly return must pay a penalty of 6 percent of the amount of prepayment. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6476. Interest will not apply if paid by the due date of the return. There is no penalty for deficiency in prepayment unless the deficiency is due to negligence or disregard of the law, in which case the penalty is 10 percent of the deficiency. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6478. Persons who fail to make any prepayment prior to the normal due date of the quarterly return but file a timely return and payment for the quarter will be assessed a penalty of 6 percent of the 90 or 95 percent the tax liability for the month for which the prepayment was due, but if the failure was due to negligence or disregard of the law, the penalty is 10 percent. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6477; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6478. Failure to File a Return Persons who fail to file a return are subject to a 10 percent penalty. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6511; California Tax Publication 75. An additional 25 percent penalty applies if the failure to file was due to fraud or intent to evade taxes. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6514; California Tax Publication 75. The seller's permit may also be revoked. California Tax Publication 73. Failure to Remit Tax Collected In general, any taxpayer who knowingly collects sales tax reimbursement or use tax and who fails to timely remit such sales tax reimbursement or use tax to the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration, will be liable for a penalty equal to 40 percent of the amount not timely remitted. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6597; California Tax Publication 75. Effective July 1, 2017, the California State Board of Equalization's(SBOE) jurisdiction over tax administration for sale and use tax was transferred to the Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA). See 2017 Cal. A.B. 102; 2017 Cal. A.B. 131. However, this penalty does not apply where the taxpayer's liability for unremitted sales or use tax does not exceed the greater of an average of $1,000 per month or 5 percent of the total tax liability for which the tax reimbursement was collected for the period in which the tax was due. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6597(a)(2)(A). Additionally, if a taxpayer's failure to make a timely remittance of sales tax reimbursement or use tax is due to a reasonable cause or circumstances beyond the taxpayer's control, and occurred despite the taxpayer's exercise of ordinary care and the absence of willful neglect, the 40 percent penalty will not apply. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6597(a)(2)(B). Direct pay permit holders are subject to the same penalties for failure to timely pay the tax liability as if the permit holder were the retailer. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7051.2. Penalty for Wrongful Use of Resale Certificates A penalty may be imposed if a resale certificate is issued for personal gain or to evade payment of taxes by a person not actively engaged in or conducting a business as a seller of tangible personal property. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6072; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6066.5; California Tax Publication 75. Penalties may include:• the amount of tax that would be due had the certificate not been used; • interest on the tax due; • the seller's permit may be revoked; • a penalty of 10 percent of the tax or $500, whichever is greater; or • 25 percent penalty for fraud or intent to evade tax. California Tax Publication 73; California Tax Publication 103. Vehicle Registration Failure to pay the required sales or use tax on the purchase of a vehicle, vessel, or aircraft may result in one or more of the following penalties: Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6485.1; California Tax Publication 75. • 10 percent for failing to file a return (including failing to register with DMV or the DHCD); • 10 percent for late payment; • 10 percent for late filing of a return; • 10 percent for negligence; • 10 percent for failure to pay the correct amount of tax (the 10 percent would apply only to the additional tax due); • 25 percent for fraud or evasion; • 50 percent for registering a vehicle, vessel, or aircraft outside California to evade payment of tax. Although California does not provide any clear guidance on determining whether a taxpayer has the requisite intent to evade tax, one Letter Decision, Appeal of Duffield, does provide some insight. Appeal of Duffield, Decision Letter (Oct. 26, 2005). In Duffield, the Board of Equalization relied on the regulations of the U.S. Treasury Department to interpret Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §24431 which was modeled after I.R.C. §269. Pursuant to Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §17024.5(h)(7), California must make due account for differences in federal and state terminology, including substituting “Franchise Tax Board” for “Secretary”when appropriate, and other obvious differences. For purposes of I.R.C. § 269, the phrase “principal purpose” requires only that the tax avoidance purpose outrank or exceed in importance any of the non-tax business purposes for the acquisition. Treas. Regs. §1.269-3(a). The determinative factor is the intention or purpose of the taxpayer at the time of the acquisition, as demonstrated by objective facts. Appeal of Duffield, Decision Letter (Oct. 26, 2005) (citing Capri Inc. v. Commissioner 65 T.C. 162, 178 (1975)). The events leading up to and following the acquisition are necessary to evaluate the taxpayer's motivations;further, all of the integral steps of a plan must be considered. Appeal of Duffield, Decision Letter (Oct. 26, 2005) (citing VGS Corp. v. Commissioner 68 T.C. 563, 595 (1977)); J.T. Slocomb Co. v. Commissioner 334 F.2d 269, 274 (2d Cir. 1964). Relief from Liability A taxpayer may be relieved from liability for payments of sales and use tax, penalties, and interest when the taxpayer reasonably relied on:• the written advice by the CDTFA; • an annotation or legal ruling of counsel involving the same fact pattern;or • the written advice of the CDTFA in a prior audit. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1705. Beginning July 1, 2014, a person with shared accounting and ownership may rely on the written advice of the CDTFA in a prior audit of the business with which it shares accounting and ownership. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1705. The CDTFA's decision to bring a delinquency action is discretionary, as is its decision to seek monetary penalties, and are therefore not subject to a writ of mandamus unless an unreasonable or arbitrary abuse of that discretion. Barrett v. California Dept. of Tax & Fee Admin., No. B276619, 2018 BL 175549 (Cal. Ct. App. May 17, 2018) (denying writ of mandamus for failing to pursue uncollected sales and use taxes from Indian retailers). BNA-SUTN CA 31.12.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Criminal Penalties

Yes In California, it is a misdemeanor to engage in a business without a permit (or permits, if the person has more than one place of business). Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6071. Violators can be fined up to $5,000 and/or sentenced to up to one year in jail. California Tax Publication 166. It is also a misdemeanor to engage in business after a permit is suspended or revoked. Each officer of a corporation operating without a valid permit is also guilty of a misdemeanor. A permit is required for each place of business at which sales transactions are customarily negotiated with customers. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6071; see also California Tax Publication 166. A monetary penalty applies when a person knowingly fails to obtain a valid permit before the date on which the first tax return is due. The penalty is equal to 50 percent of the amount of tax due and is in addition to any additional penalties or interest that may apply. This penalty does not apply to: Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7155; California Tax Publication 75. • persons whose sales averaged $1,000 or less per month, or • taxes due on the sale or use of a vehicle, vessel, or aircraft, if the amount is subject to the penalty imposed by Cal. Rev. &Tax. Code §6485.1 or Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6514.1. BNA-SUTN CA 31.12.2.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Waiver of Penalties

Yes Any penalty resulting from tax delinquency may be canceled by the auditor or tax collector upon finding of reasonable cause and circumstances beyond the taxpayer's control. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §4985.2. Eligible penalties must have also occurred notwithstanding the exercise of ordinary care in the absence of willful neglect, provided the principal payment for the proper amount of the tax due is made no later than June 30 of the fourth fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the tax became delinquent. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §4985.2(a). Examples of reasonable care include the reliance on erroneous written advice from the CDTFA, or late returns or payments due to a disaster. California Tax Publication 75. California also provides for cancellation of penalty in the case of inadvertent error in the amount of payment made by the taxpayer, provided the principal payment for the proper amount of the tax due is made within 10 days after the notice of shortage is mailed by the tax collector. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §4985.2(b). The Director of the CDTFA may also approve a settlement of taxes or fees. Settlements where the reduction in taxes or fees exceed $5,000 must also be commented on by the Attorney General. California Dept. of Tax and Fee Admin., Compliance Policy and Procedures Manual, Chapter 1. BNA-SUTN CA 31.12.3.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Interest Frequency of Interest Rate Determination

Semiannually California determines the interest rate for underpayments and overpayments on a semi-annual basis. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6591.5. A rate change, if required, takes effect six months later and remains in effect for at least six months. The rate for January applies to the following July 1 to December 31, and the rate for July applies to the following January 1 to June 30. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6591.5; California Tax Publication 75. BNA-SUTN CA 31.13.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Interest Underpayment Rates Calculation

Federal Rate + 3% Persons who fail to timely file and make payments of sales and use tax must pay a penalty of 10 percent of the tax plus interest accrued at a rate established by statute. The California Department of Tax and Fee Administration indicates that the interest rate applied to unpaid and underpaid taxes is based on the rate established by I.R.C. §6621, plus 3 percent. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6591; California Tax Publication 75. Effective July 1, 2017, the California State Board of Equalization's(SBOE) jurisdiction over tax administration for sale and use tax was transferred to the Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA). See 2017 Cal. A.B. 102; 2017 Cal. A.B. 131. For a complete schedule of historical interest rates, see California Dept. of Tax & Fee Admin., Interest Rates. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6591; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6591.5; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1703, revised effective July 1, 2017; California Tax Publication 75. Late payment interest is generally calculated on a monthly basis. However, the CDTFA has the authority to compute the interest on a daily basis if the late payment was made electronically one business day after it was due, if the taxpayer was granted relief from all penalties, and if the taxpayer filed a request for an oral hearing in front of the CDTFA. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6591.6, as amended by 2016 Cal. A.B. 2201; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1703(b)(5), revised effective July 1, 2017. Innocent Spouse Frequently both spouses' names will appear on an application for a seller's permit. In such circumstances, an innocent spouse may be relieved of understated tax liability (and penalties and interest) caused by failure to file a return, omission of sums that should have been included in the return, or using erroneous deductions or credits if the understatement is attributable to one spouse. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6456; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1705.1. An erroneous deduction or credit is attributable to the spouse who caused it to be entered on the return. Whether the spouse contributed services as a retailer of the taxable items to which the understatement is attributed may determine whether the error is attributable to the spouse. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6456(e). The spouse seeking to escape liability must show that he or she did not know of the error or omission and had no reason to know of it. The standard for determining whether the spouse had reason to know of the understatement is whether a reasonably prudent person would have known of the understatement. Equitable considerations about whether the spouse benefitted directly or indirectly from the understatement are relevant to the decision as to whether to impose liability on the spouse. Relief from Liability A taxpayer may be relieved from liability for payments of sales and use tax, penalties, and interest when the taxpayer reasonably relied on:• the written advice by the CDTFA; • an annotation or legal ruling of counsel involving the same fact pattern; or • the written advice of the CDTFA in a prior audit. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1705. Beginning July 1, 2014, a person with shared accounting and ownership may rely on the written advice of the CDTFA in a prior audit of the business with which it shares accounting and ownership. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1705. Relief is provided for interest imposed under Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6459, Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6480.4, Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6480.8, Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6513, Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6591 and Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6592.5 if the CDTFA finds that a person's failure, despite the exercise of ordinary care and the absence of willful neglect, to make a timely return or payment was caused by a disaster. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6593. For tax liabilities arising during taxable periods commencing on or after July 1, 1999, the CDTFA, in its discretion, may relieve all or any part of the interest imposed by Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6480.4, 6480.8, 6513, 6591 and 6592.5 when the failure to pay the tax was due to an unreasonable error or delay by a CDTFA employee, or an error by the Department of Motor Vehicles in calculating the use tax on a vehicle or vessel registered with that Department. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6593.5; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1703(b)(1)(E). For an action for recovery under Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6961 on or after July 1, 1999, no interest is imposed on an erroneous refund by the CDTFA until 30 days after the date on which the CDTFA mails a notice of determination for repayment of the erroneous refund if the CDTFA finds that neither the person liable for payment of tax nor any related party had caused the erroneous refund. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6964; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1703(b)(1)(F). Any person seeking to be relieved of the interest is required to file with the CDTFA a statement under penalty of perjury stating the facts on which the claim for relief is based.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Voluntary Disclosure Relief

Yes The California Department of Tax and Fee Administration provides two different voluntary disclosure programs for reporting use tax. Participants may be eligible for penalty waivers, limitation of use tax assessment to three years, and advisory opinions. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6487.05; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6487.06; California Tax Publication 178; California Tax Publication 542—Edition 8. Effective July 1, 2017, the California State Board of Equalization's (SBOE) jurisdiction over tax administration for sale and use tax was transferred to the Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA). See 2017 Cal. A.B. 102; 2017 Cal. A.B. 131. The In-State Voluntary Disclosure Program is available for in-state purchasers for the purpose of reporting use tax on purchases of tangible personal property from retailers outside of California. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6487.06; California Tax Publication 178. Purchasers apply for California's In-State Voluntary Disclosure Program by completing and submitting California Form CDTFA-38-I: Application for In-State Voluntary Disclosure. The Out-of-State Voluntary Disclosure Program is available for out-of-state businesses for the purpose of reporting use tax on sales to consumers in California. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6487.05; California Tax Publication 178. To be eligible, the business must not have previously been registered with the CDTFA or contacted by the CDTFA or its agents regarding activities in California. Additionally, the business's failure to pay the tax or file a return must have been due to reasonable cause and not due to negligence or intentional disregard of the law.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Voluntary Disclosure Multistate Tax Commission (MTC) Program

Does Not Participate California does not participate in the Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program. Multistate Tax Commission, Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program. The MVDP allows taxpayers with outstanding tax liabilities in multiple states to negotiate settlements via a process coordinated by the National Nexus Program (NNP) staff of the MTC. Multistate Tax Commission, Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program. To participate in the MVDP, the taxpayer must:• have a minimum good-faith tax liability estimate of $500 or more; • not have been contacted by a state or commission regarding taxes due;and • submit a completed Voluntary Disclosure Agreement (VDA) including taxpayer's contact information, tax year, list of states to receive the proposed VDA, description of taxpayer's activities in each state, and estimate of taxes due. Multistate Tax Commission, Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program. The program is intended to incentivize taxpayers to begin filing and paying taxes in all of the states in which they have substantial nexus. Upon entering into a voluntary disclosure agreement with a state, taxpayers will be required to file returns, pay the tax due and accrued interest on the returns, and register with the state in exchange for waiver of penalties for the entire look-back period. Taxpayers are not charged to participate in the MVDP. BNA-SUTN CA 31.15.3.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Audits

Authorized For the purpose of determining the correct amount of sales and use tax due, the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration has the authority to examine and audit the records, books, or other relevant information that taxpayers are required to maintain relating to sales and use tax. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7054; see California Sales and Use Tax Audit Manual, Chapter 1. Effective July 1, 2017, the California State Board of Equalization's (SBOE)jurisdiction over tax administration for sale and use tax was transferred to the Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6481. See 2017 Cal. A.B. 102; 2017 Cal. A.B. 131; see also In the Matter of the Appeal of Roberto Hernandez, d/b/a Raliberto's Taco Shop, OTA Case No. 18011944 (March 4, 2019) (taxpayer's books and records provided for audit were incomplete and unreliable and the CDTFA was permitted to use the credit-card-sales-ratio method and the taxpayer's bank statements as the best-available evidence to determine the correct tax liability); see also In the Matter of the Appeal of Sonic Lighting, Inc., OTA Case No. 18011878 (March 6, 2019) (CDTFA determined that taxpayer's books and records were insufficient, its bank deposits exceeded sales by over $3,000,000 and taxpayer computed a negative mark-up percentage on its sales;therefore, CDTFA was justified in computing taxpayer's sales using the markup method as the best-available evidence to determine the correct tax liability). Also, the CDTFA has the authority to summon records, books, and witnesses to give testimony necessary to determine the correct sales and use tax owed. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 7054. See California Publication 147; California Tax Publication 76. An audit must be completed and provide enough time to allow the CDTFA to issue a Notice of Determination or Notice of Refund within the applicable statute of limitations. For sales and use tax purposes, the applicable statute is three years from the date the return was due or the return was filed, whichever is later. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6487. The taxpayer may consent to extend the period by signing a waiver of limitation. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1698.5(b)(2). A taxpayer may waive the applicable statute of limitations before the statute expiration date. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1698.5(b)(3). Under certain circumstances, the percentage of error developed in previous audits may be used by the auditor to determine liability. The use of the prior percentage of error allows a more efficient and less burdensome audit. A previous audit percentage of error may be used in up to two subsequent audits. California Tax Publication 76. Audit and Informal Conferences with Field Personnel In routine audits, the taxpayer and the CDTFA have ample opportunity to discuss the recommendations of the auditor. If the taxpayer and the auditor are unable to agree on the audit recommendations, the auditor will normally arrange a meeting between the auditor's field supervisor and the taxpayer. If points of disagreement still exist after the conference with the supervisor, the taxpayer will be furnished a field audit report, which may be marked to indicate that the taxpayer does not concur. If the taxpayer does not respond within ten days it is assumed that the taxpayer agrees with the audit. California Tax Publication 76. When the taxpayer disagrees with the auditor's recommendations, a letter will often be sent by the local CDTFA office to the taxpayer, giving the taxpayer the opportunity to appear before the CDTFA's principal auditor in the local district before a billing is made. The letter will give the taxpayer ten days within which to make an appointment. The meeting with the district principal auditor is informal, and the taxpayer may present any matter that he or she believes is pertinent. In cases in which the statute of limitations is in issue or when the facts indicate that a local hearing would be inappropriate, the local CDTFA office advises the taxpayer in writing that the audit has been forwarded to Sacramento for review. Audits are usually forwarded if the issue is complicated, uncertainty exists at the local level, an industry-wide issue is present, or the taxpayer has expressed a desire to proceed with statutory hearing procedures(i.e., a Notice of Determination) without delay. The CDTFA encourages taxpayers to take full advantage of the informal meetings with the auditor and other local staff personnel. Cooperation at an early stage often permits the fastest and least expensive manner of resolving the dispute. In other cases, e.g., when the auditor appears determined to set up an adjustment irrespective of any argument advanced by the taxpayer, a Notice of Determination should ordinarily be requested. Notice of Determination When the CDTFA's audit staff concludes that a return filed by a taxpayer is incorrect, it will issue a Notice of Determination based on any information within its possession, including an estimate based on incomplete information. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6481; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6486; see Maganini v. Quinn, 221 P.2d 241 (Cal. Ct. App. 1950). A 10 percent negligence penalty, and a 25 percent penalty for fraud or an intent to evade the statute or authorized rules and regulations, may be added. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6484 through Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6485; see In the Matter of the Appeal of Mohammad Bagher Bahour, OTA Case No. 18011877,(March 4, 2019) (a 10 percent negligence penalty imposed on a responsible person was appropriate when habitual underreporting of taxable sales is identified in multiple audits). If no return has been filed by the taxpayer, a 10 percent penalty is added to the amount of the taxpayer's liability as determined by the CDTFA. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6511. Failure or refusal to refurnish a return or other data required by the CDTFA is a misdemeanor. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6452(c); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 7155; Cal. Govt. Code §7173. A Notice of Determination must be mailed by the CDTFA within three years from the last day of the calendar month following the quarterly period for which the amount is determined, or within three years after the return is filed, whichever is later. When no return has been filed, the Notice may be mailed within eight years after the last day of the calendar month following the quarterly period for which the amount is determined. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6487(a). The limitation period for taxpayers filing returns on an annual basis is three years from the last day of the calendar month following the one-year period for which the amount is proposed to be determined, or within three years after the return is filed, whichever period expires later. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6487(b). No period of limitations applies in cases of fraud or intent to evade. The burden of proof with respect to fraud or intent to evade lies with the CDTFA. Marchica v. California State Bd. of Equal., 107 Cal.App.2d 501, 237 P.2d 725 (Cal. Ct. App. 1951). The CDTFA and a taxpayer can agree to extend the period for issuance of a Notice of Determination before the time has otherwise expired. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6488. Jeopardy Determination The CDTFA is authorized to issue a jeopardy determination when it believes that collection will be jeopardized by delay. The amount determined is immediately due and payable. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6536; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §5221 to Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 5225. A petition for redetermination may be filed within ten days, or a 10 percent penalty plus interest will attach on unpaid amounts. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6537; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6591. A petition for redetermination must be accompanied by security deemed necessary by the CDTFA to ensure compliance. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6538. An administrative hearing may be sought to (1) establish that the determination is excessive, (2) seek a delay of the sale of property seized after issuance of the jeopardy determination upon a showing that a sale would cause irreparable injury, (3) request the release of seized property, or (4) request a stay of collection activities. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §5225. The application shall be filed within 30 days after service of the notice of jeopardy determination and must state the specific factual and legal grounds upon which it is founded. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6538.5. Petition for Redetermination A person against whom a determination is made or anyone else who is directly interested may petition for redetermination within 30 days after service of the Notice of Determination and failure to file a petition within the 30 day period results in the determination becoming final. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6561; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 5210; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 5211. The petition must be in writing and must state the specific grounds on which the petition is based. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §5212. Additional grounds may be offered by amending the petition for redetermination at any time before the date on which the CDTFA issues its order or decision. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6561.5; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §5212.5. The petition should request a hearing before the CDTFA, if desired. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6562. Managed Audit Program The CDTFA's Managed Audit Program allows certain taxpayers to conduct a type of self-audit with instructions and guidance from the CDTFA's auditors. If a taxpayer completes a managed audit and owes additional tax, the taxpayer will only pay one-half of the interest on its tax liability. California Tax Publication 53. If a taxpayer has been selected for an audit and requests to participate in a managed audit, an auditor will assess the taxpayer's resources and the taxpayer's ability to perform some or all of the audit functions. Eligible taxpayers are those who have generally straightforward tax issues, the resources necessary to do the work and transactions that are not subject to a number of exemptions. Taxpayers with complex legal issues are generally not eligible to participate in managed audits. If a taxpayer is selected to participate in a managed audit, the taxpayer will be required to enter into a Managed Audit Program Participation Agreement with the CDTFA. California Tax Publication 53. BNA-SUTN CA 31.16.

Permitted Any person who has received a Notice of Determination (NOD) from the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) may file a petition for redetermination within 30 days of the mailing date of the notice. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6561; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 35007, re-adopted effective Sept. 17, 2018; see California Office of Tax Appeals v. First Am. Title Ins. Co., OTA Case No. 18042592 (Oct. 31, 2018) (the order or decision upon a petition for redetermination becomes final 30 days after service upon the petitioner of the notice;holding that notice was sufficient and respondent was not entitled to rehearing on grounds of “newly discovered evidence”when there was no new evidence obtained). For coverage of petitions for redetermination, see Portfolio 1700-2nd: State Tax Appeal Systems at 1700.06.B.3.a. If a petition for redetermination is not fully resolved to a taxpayer's satisfaction, the taxpayer may request an appeals conference, with the Appeals Bureau of the CDTFA, in writing within 30 days of the mailing date of the letter announcing the petition findings. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 35017(h); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 35032. For coverage of appeals to CDTFA, see Portfolio 1700-2nd: State Tax Appeal Systems at 1700.06.B.3.b. The Office of Tax Appeals hears appeals from decisions issued by the Appeals Bureau of the CDTFA that are timely filed in the following circumstances:• a Appeals Bureau decision is adverse to the taxpayer, in whole or in part; • a local entity is party to a petition for redistribution of local or district tax and the Appeals Bureau decision is adverse to that local entity, in whole or in part; or • a state agency other than the CDTFA is a party to a taxpayer's appeal and the Appeals Bureau decision is adverse to that state agency, in whole or in part. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 30103(b), as adopted by 2019 Cal. Regulatory Notice Reg., No. 2-Z (Jan. 11, 2019), effective Jan. 3, 2019; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §30201, as added by 2019 Cal. Regulatory Notice Reg., No. 2-Z (Jan. 11, 2019), effective Jan. 3, 2019.

TAAP is only available for taxpayers who owe or are claiming a refund of less than $30,000. Under TAAP, qualifying taxpayers receive no-cost help from law students working under experienced tax attorneys. California Tax Publication 215. TAAP is only authorized to provide assistance to taxpayers who are appealing one of a list of qualifying issues in a billing by the CDTFA. California Tax Publication 215 (previous versions of this publication stated that taxpayers could receive help from TAAP on certain decisions by the Franchise Tax Board; this information was removed in the January 2019 version). Qualifying issues in bills issued by the CDTFA include, but are not limited to:• consumer use tax; • dual determinations;and • successor liability. California Tax Publication 215. BNA-SUTN CA 31.17.
