Tax Base Michigan's Equalization Act imposes tax on the sale or transfer of any aircraft (as well as vehicle, ORV, manufactured home, snowmobile, or watercraft) based on the retail dollar value of the property at the time of acquisition, rather than the purchase price. To the extent that the purchase price is less than the retail dollar value of the property, equalization tax is imposed on the difference. The department of revenue determines the “retail dollar value”using the Aircraft Bluebook. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.179; Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2017-26 (Dec. 15, 2017). Transfers Between Family Members Michigan exempts transfers from use tax where the transferee or purchaser is the spouse, mother, father, brother, sister, child, stepparent, stepchild, stepbrother, stepsister, grandparent, grandchild, legal ward, or a legally appointed guardian with a certified letter of guardianship, of the transferor.

Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Aircraft, Interstate and Common Carrier Purchase, Lease, or Rental Transactions

Depends The sale of an aircraft is exempt from taxation if sold to a domestic air carrier, the aircraft has a certificated takeoff weight of at least 6,000 pounds, and the aircraft is for use solely in the transport of air cargo, passengers, or a combination of air cargo and passengers. Mich. Comp. Laws § 205.54x(1)(a). Tax Base Michigan's Equalization Act imposes tax on the sale or transfer of any aircraft (as well as vehicle, ORV, manufactured home, snowmobile, or watercraft) based on the retail dollar value of the property at the time of acquisition, rather than the purchase price. To the extent that the purchase price is less than the retail dollar value of the property, equalization tax is imposed on the difference. The department of revenue determines the “retail dollar value”using the Aircraft Bluebook. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.179; Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2017-26 (Dec. 15, 2017). Leases Michigan provides airplane lessors, as the final consumers of the property, two options in paying the sales or use tax due on lease transactions. Mich. Comp. Laws § 205.95(4). First, lessor may elect to pay sales tax on the full cost of the property at the time the lessor acquires ownership of the property. Mich. Comp. Laws § 205.95(4). Alternatively, the lessor may elect to obtain a Use Tax Registration with the Michigan Department of Treasury, which will allow the lessor to purchase the property exempt from sales tax. Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2015-25 (Dec. 2, 2015). This option requires the lessor to pay use tax calculated on the total rental receipts received under the lease each month. Mich. Comp. Laws § 205.95(4); Mich. Admin. Code r. 205.132(1); Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2015-25 (Dec. 2, 2015). To be eligible, a taxpayer must actually be engaged in the business of renting or leasing tangible personal property to others for profit. See FMG Leasing, LLC v. Michigan Dept. of Treas., 2014 BL 179938 (Mich. Ct. App. 2014) (a taxpayer leasing aircraft only to related entities and persons was not eligible to pay use tax on its rental receipts and was required to pay use tax on the full purchase price of the property); see also CDM Leasing, LLC v. Michigan Dept. of Treas., 2014 BL 357426 (Mich. Ct. App. 2014) (taxpayer did not qualify as a lessor of an aircraft because it did not look for other leasing opportunities through advertising, nor did it adjust its lease to cover its fixed costs. Further, taxpayer's leasing of construction equipment did not mean it was a lessor of an aircraft. Therefore, the taxpayer could not pay use tax on the rental receipts in lieu of paying tax on its initial purchase of the aircraft). If the tangible personal property leased is an airplane and the lessor elects to pay use tax on the rental receipts, then the election to do so must be at the earlier of the date set for the first payment of use tax in the lease agreement or 90 days after the lessor brings the aircraft into Michigan. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.95(4); CCXLS LLC v. Michigan Dept. of Treas., 2012 BL 268462 (Mich. Ct. App. 2012) (leave to appeal denied, Mich., No. 146198, (April 29, 2013). If a lessor purchases property outside of Michigan for purposes of leasing the property in Michigan, the lessor must pay use tax on the property at the time it is leased in Michigan. Mich. Comp. Laws § 205.95(4); NACG Leasing LLC v. Michigan Dept. of Treas., No. 146234, 2014 BL 36494 (Mich. 2014) (a taxpayer was subject to use tax when it purchased an aircraft from out an out-of-state seller, and simultaneously leased the aircraft to a related entity that had possession of the aircraft in Michigan at the time of the transfer.

Mich. Comp. Laws §205.54d(c). Sales of motor vehicles do not qualify for the use tax exemption for property purchased from a seller or transferor if the property is part of the purchase or transfer of a business. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.94g(2)(b). Motor Vehicle Trade-ins In Michigan, the agreed-upon value of a motor vehicle traded in as part payment for the purchase of a new or used motor or recreational vehicle may be deducted from the taxable sales price. However, from Jan. 1, 2018, to Dec. 31, 2018, this amount is capped at $4,000. Beginning Jan. 1, 2019, the deduction will increase to $5,000. On Jan. 1, 2020, and each January 1 thereafter, this amount will increase by an additional $1,000 each year. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.51(1)(d)(xii)(D) (sales tax), as amended by 2017 Mich. S.B. 94, effective Jan. 18, 2018; Mich. Comp. Laws §205.92(f)(xii)(D) (use tax), as amended by 2017 Mich. S.B. 95, effective Jan. 18, 2018. The trade-in deduction first took effect on Dec. 15, 2013, and was capped at $2,000. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.51(1)(d)(xii); Mich. Comp. Laws §205.92(f)(xii); see also Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2016-6. Beginning Jan. 1, 2015, this cap increased by $500 each January through 2018. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.51(1)(d)(xii)(B), as amended by 2015 Michigan S.B. 233, effective retroactively to Dec. 15, 2013; Mich. Comp. Laws §205.92(f)(xii)(B); see Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2016-6; Michigan Trade-in Sales Tax Credit Increase (December 2016). To qualify, the agreed-upon value of the car to be traded-in must be separately stated on the invoice or bill of sale. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.51(1)(d)(xii); Mich. Comp. Laws §205.92(f)(xii). For the trade-in deduction to be claimed, Michigan initially required that the seller allowing a trade-in be an in-state dealer. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.92(f)(xii) (2015). However, the law was amended retroactively to remove this requirement and the deduction may now be claimed for motor and recreational vehicles purchased from either in-state or out-of-state dealers. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.51(1)(m), as amended by 2016 Mich. S.B. 233, effective Dec. 15, 2013; Mich. Comp. Laws §205.92(f)(xii), as amended by 2016 Mich. S.B. 232, effective Dec. 15, 2013; Mich. Comp. Laws §205.92(t), as amended by 2016 Mich. S.B. 232, effective Dec. 15, 2013. The trade-in sales tax credit applies even when the purchaser is a non-resident. Dealers must calculate the Michigan sales tax applying the trade-in sales tax credit and then make a separate calculation applying the purchaser's home state sales tax rate. The Michigan dealer collects the lower of the two sales tax calculations. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.51(1)(d)(xii)(D);Michigan Dept. of State, Vehicle Sales Tax Trade-in Credit – Frequently Asked Questions. Any vehicle meeting the Michigan Vehicle Code definition of a motor vehicle is eligible for the trade-in sales tax credit, including motorcycles, mopeds, or motor homes. Recreational vehicles including a trailer coach, fifth-wheel, or pop-up camper are eligible for the sales tax credit. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.51(1)(d)(xii)(D);Michigan Dept. of State, Vehicle Sales Tax Trade-in Credit – Frequently Asked Questions. Utility trailers, snowmobiles, off-road vehicles, or mobile homes are not eligible for the trade-in sales tax credit. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.51(1)(d)(xii)(D);Michigan Dept. of State, Vehicle Sales Tax Trade-in Credit – Frequently Asked Questions. Only one vehicle can be used toward the sales tax trade-in credit. If two or more vehicles are traded in, sales tax credit for only one of the vehicles can be applied. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.51(1)(d)(xii)(D);Michigan Dept. of State, Vehicle Sales Tax Trade-in Credit – Frequently Asked Questions. A trade-in can qualify for the deduction even if the purchaser trading in the motor or recreational vehicle has negative equity in it. The dealer may claim the deduction up the lesser of the capped value of the trade-in or the agreed-upon value of the trade in. The invoice, bill of sale, or other similar document must clearly state the amount represented by the agreed-upon value of the trade-in vehicle. The dealer may not claim the deduction for any amounts that are not attributed to the value of the trade-in vehicle. See Michigan Letter Ruling LR 2015-1 (April 20, 2015). Effective Jan. 1, 2017, dealers are required to submit a completed RD-108T form on all vehicle transactions with a trade-in. Michigan Trade-in Sales Tax Credit Increase (December 2016). Transfers by Non-Licensed Dealers The ownership transfer of vehicles, other than those sold by a Michigan licensed new or used vehicle dealer, is governed by the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Revenue Equalization Act (Equalization Act). Mich. Comp. Laws §205.179; Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2017-26 (Dec. 15, 2017). The Equalization Act imposes tax on the sale or transfer of any vehicle, ORV, manufactured home, aircraft, snowmobile, or watercraft—based on the retail dollar value of the property at the time of acquisition, rather than the purchase price. To the extent that the purchase price is less than the retail dollar value of the property, equalization tax is imposed on the difference. The department of revenue determines the “retail dollar value” using the National Auto Dealers Association (NADA) valuation guide. Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2017-26 (Dec. 15, 2017). Transfers by new or used vehicle dealers that are licensed by the State of Michigan are not subject to the equalization tax. Therefore, a sale or transfer by a Michigan licensed dealer is only subject to use tax based on the purchase price. Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2017-26 (Dec. 15, 2017). Transfers Between Family Members Michigan exempts transfers from use tax where the transferee or purchaser is the spouse, mother, father, brother, sister, child, stepparent, stepchild, stepbrother, stepsister, grandparent, grandchild, legal ward, or a legally appointed guardian with a certified letter of guardianship, of the transferor. Mich. Comp. Laws 205.93(3)(a); Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2018-5 (March 5, 2018). Additionally, effective Jan. 1, 2014, transfers of certain vehicles to certain “in-laws” are also exempt from use tax. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.94bb; Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2018-5 (March 5, 2018); see also Michigan Internal Policy Directive 2015-1 (May 28, 2015). Specifically, Michigan exempts from sales and use tax the transfer of a vehicle, if the transferee or purchaser is the father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, or grandparent-in-law or the transferor. Vehicles include off-road vehicles, manufactured homes, aircraft, snowmobiles, and watercraft. 2014 Mich. H.B. 5261, retroactively effective, 4bb added, Jan. 1, 2014; Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2018-5 (March 5, 2018). Lease or Rental of Motor Vehicles The lease or rental of a motor vehicle is subject to use tax. “Lease or rental”means the transfer of possession or control of tangible personal property for a fixed or indeterminate term for consideration that may include future options to purchase or extend. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.51a(m); Mich. Comp. Laws 205.92b(m). Sales tax is due on the exercise of a purchase price option. The lease or rental and the subsequent sale are treated as two different transactions for sales tax purposes. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.51(1)(d); Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2015-25 (Dec. 2, 2015); Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 1990-15 (April 12, 1990). A transfer of possession or control of a motor vehicle under a security agreement or deferred payment plan that requires the transfer of title upon completion of the required payments is not a lease or rental, but rather a sale. As a result, sales tax is charged, collected, and remitted upfront. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.51a(m); Mich. Comp. Laws 205.92b(m). Similarly, the transfer of possession or control of a motor vehicle under an agreement requiring transfer of title upon completion of the required payments and payment of an option price that does not exceed the greater of $100 or 1 percent of the total required payments is a sale, not a lease or rental. As a result, sales tax is due at the time the vehicle is acquired. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.51a(m)(ii); Mich. Comp. Laws §205.92b(m)(ii). BNA-SUTN MI 29.3.1.

Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Motor Vehicles, Interstate and Common Carrier Purchase, Lease, or Rental Transactions

Taxable The transfer of a motor vehicle is subject to use tax. However, sales of certain motor carriers are exempt from sales and use tax if used in interstate commerce. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.93(2); Mich. Comp. Laws §205.52(1). Motor vehicle leases are subject to sales and use tax. “Lease or rental” means the transfer of possession or control of tangible personal property for a fixed or indeterminate term for consideration that may include future options to purchase or extend. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.51a(m); Mich. Comp. Laws 205.92b(m). A person engaged in the business of renting or leasing motor vehicles may elect to pay use tax on the lease or rental receipts or pay the Michigan sales or use tax on the full cost of the property at the time the lessor purchases the motor vehicle. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.95(4); Mich. Admin. Code r. 205.132(1). Michigan does not impose sales and use tax on the sale of rolling stock purchased by an interstate motor carrier or the rental of a lease to an interstate motor carrier and used in interstate commerce. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.54r(1); see also Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2016-2 (Jan. 8, 2016) (explaining that for both sales tax and use tax purposes, the three requirements are the same—the property must be “rolling stock;” it must be purchased, rented, or leased by an “interstate motor carrier,” and it must be “used in interstate commerce”). Similarly, Michigan exempts from tax the storage, use, or consumption of rolling stock used in interstate commerce and purchased, rented, or leased by an interstate fleet motor carrier. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.94k(4). “Interstate fleet motor carrier”means a person engaged in the business of carrying persons or property, other than themselves, their employees, or their own property, for hire across state lines, whose fleet mileage was driven at least 10 percent out-of-state in the immediately preceding tax year. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.94k(6)(d). To qualify as an interstate fleet motor carrier, the primary purpose of a business must be to transport persons or property for hire across state lines. That its activities might incidentally include such actions is insufficient to qualify. Midwest Power Line, Inc. v. Dep't of Treasury, 2018 BL 181816 (Mich. Ct. App. 2018); Michigan Treasury Update -September 2018. To qualify for the rolling stock exemption, the rolling stock must be “used in interstate commerce.” Rolling stock may be used in interstate commerce in either of two ways. First, the rolling stock could physically cross state lines. Second, the rolling stock could not physically cross state lines, but it could carry persons or property that originated from or is destined for locations outside of Michigan. Alvan Motor Freight, Inc. v. Michigan Dept. of Treas., 761 N.W.2d 269, 2008 BL 215075 (Mich. Ct. App. 2008); see also Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2016-2 (Jan. 8, 2016). Michigan defines the term “rolling stock”as a “qualified truck, a trailer designed to be drawn behind a qualified truck, and parts or other tangible personal property affixed to or to be affixed to and directly used in the operation of either a qualified truck or a trailer designed to be drawn behind a qualified truck.” Mich. Comp. Laws §205.94k(6)(i). A “qualified truck” is defined as “a commercial motor vehicle power unit that has 2 axles and a gross vehicle weight rating in excess of 10,000 pounds or a commercial motor vehicle power unit has 3 or more axles.” Mich. Comp. Laws §205.94k(6)(g). Transfers by Non-Licensed Dealers The ownership transfer of vehicles, other than those sold by a Michigan licensed new or used vehicle dealer, is governed by the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Revenue Equalization Act (Equalization Act). Mich. Comp. Laws §205.179; Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2017-26 (Dec. 15, 2017). The Equalization Act imposes tax on the sale or transfer of any vehicle, ORV, manufactured home, aircraft, snowmobile, or watercraft—based on the retail dollar value of the property at the time of acquisition, rather than the purchase price. To the extent that the purchase price is less than the retail dollar value of the property, equalization tax is imposed on the difference. The department of revenue determines the “retail dollar value” using the National Auto Dealers Association (NADA) valuation guide. Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2017-26 (Dec. 15, 2017). Transfers by new or used vehicle dealers that are licensed by the State of Michigan are not subject to the equalization tax. Therefore, a sale or transfer by a Michigan licensed dealer is only subject to use tax based on the purchase price. Michigan Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2017-26 (Dec. 15, 2017). BNA-SUTN MI 29.4.1.

Sales of watercraft do not qualify for the use tax exemption for property purchased from a seller or transferor if the property is part of the purchase or transfer of a business. Mich. Comp. Laws §205.94g(2)(b). In Podmajersky v. Michigan Dept. of Treas., the taxpayer was found responsible for use tax on a yacht that had been immobilized in Michigan within 90 days of its purchase. While the court of appeals discussed at length the taxpayer's attempts to avoid paying use tax in any jurisdiction, they ultimately settled on a strict interpretation of their use tax imposition statute, deciding that since the yacht was stored and used in Michigan within 90 days of its purchase, it was subject to Michigan use tax. Podmajersky v. Michigan Dept. of Treas., 2013 BL 214298 (Mich. Ct. App. 2013). Tax Base Michigan's Equalization Act imposes tax on the sale or transfer of any watercraft (as well as vehicle, ORV, manufactured home, snowmobile, or watercraft) based on the retail dollar value of the property at the time of acquisition, rather than the purchase price. To the extent that the purchase price is less than the retail dollar value of the property, equalization tax is imposed on the difference.
