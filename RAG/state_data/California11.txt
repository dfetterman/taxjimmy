Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Sales Tax

Yes For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail in California, the state imposes sales tax upon all retailers based upon their gross receipts from the retail sales of tangible personal property within the state. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6051. The seller of tangible personal property—not the purchaser—is ultimately liable to pay the sales tax to the state. The seller can seek reimbursement from the purchaser. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6051. Nonetheless, the legal incidence of the sales tax is on the seller, even though the economic burden is passed on to the purchaser. See Western Lithograph Co. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 11 Cal. 2d 156, 78 P.2d 731 (Cal. 1938). But see Diamond Natl. Corp. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 425 U.S. 268, 96 S. Ct. 1530 (U.S. 1976) (holding that the incidence of the California state and local sales taxes falls on the purchaser and not on the vendor, and accordingly struck down the tax on sales to national banks that were exempted by federal law from such state and local taxes). The California Department of Tax and Fee Administration Effective July 1, 2017, the California State Board of Equalization's (SBOE) jurisdiction over tax administration for sales and use tax was transferred to the Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA). See 2017 Cal. A.B. 102, effective July 1, 2017. For more information, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at California 31.1.1. has taken the administrative position and the court agreed in Xerox Corp. v. Orange County, Calif., Xerox Corp. v. Orange County, Calif., 136 Cal. Rptr. 583 (Cal. Ct. App. 1977). that the California state and local sales taxes are still imposed on the retailer under California law despite the contrary holding of the Supreme Court in Diamond for certain federal purposes. Businesses physically located in California making sales to California customers at retail stores, over the internet, by sales representative, over the phone, or by mail order are tasked with the responsibility of collecting sales tax on taxable sales of tangible personal property. California Tax Publication 109. Out-of-state retailers making sales by internet telephone or mail to California Residents are generally not responsible for collection of sales tax; however, the California resident continues to owe use tax on the purchase unless a specific exemption applies. An out-of-state seller doing business in the state making such sales to California residents is required to register with the state and collect use tax due by its customers. California Tax Publication 109. Not all transfers of title or possession are sales. Only transfers for consideration are included in the statutory definition of sale. Thus, contributions to capital, dividends, and gifts are not subject to sales tax. In Wallace Berrie &Co. v. California State Bd. of Equal., the court upheld Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1670(b), which requires evidence that a supplier receive consideration of at least 50 percent of its purchase price of marketing aids from its customers in order to prove sales of marketing aids had occurred. Wallace Berrie & Co. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 40 Cal.3d 60, 707 P.2d 204 (Cal. 1985); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, § 1670(b). BNA-SUTN CA 1.1.1.

Yes Every person storing, using, or otherwise consuming tangible personal property in California purchased from a retailer is liable for the tax. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6201; California Tax Publication 452. His or her liability is not extinguished until the tax has been paid, unless a receipt from a retailer engaged in or authorized to do business in this state is given to the purchaser pursuant to Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6203. Generally, this is true regardless of whether the order is over the internet, by telephone, or by mail. California Tax Publication 109 (providing guidance on sales made over the internet); California SBOE News Release NR 95-16-G (Dec. 22, 2016) (reminding Californians to pay use tax on online purchases); California Tax Publication 53A (Californians required to pay use tax on online purchases); California Tax Publication 177 (use tax on out-of-state purchases). The principal purpose of the use tax is to prevent avoidance or evasion of the sales tax by the purchase of tangible personal property outside California where either no sales tax is imposed or the applicable tax rate is lower than the California rate. Use tax is never imposed as a duplicate tax along with sales tax, because any use of property in California is exempt from use tax if the gross receipts from the sale of the property are included in the measure of the sales tax. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6401; see also California Tax Publication 110 (California Use Tax Basics); California Tax Publication 123 (guidance on use tax for businesses); California SBOE News Release NR 95-16-G (Dec. 22, 2016) (use tax on purchases made over the internet). For outright sales in California, the sales tax is the principal tax, except for sales by private persons of vehicles, aircraft, and most vessels. As a result of abuses of the occasional-sale exemption of motor vehicles from sales tax, in 1965, the legislature made all retail sales of vehicles, vessels, and aircraft taxable. See Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6282. However, private party sales of such property are exempt from sales tax, Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6283. and use tax is collected from the buyer at the time of registration. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6292. With respect to leases, use tax is the principal tax, and sales tax is not imposed on rentals required to be included in the measure of the use tax. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6390. The exemption from the use tax of property used in California required to be included in the measure of the sales tax does not cover “the possession of, or the exercise of any right or power over, tangible personal property by a lessee under a lease.” Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6401. For further discussion on the distinction between services and products, see Tobi Transport, Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 104 Cal. App. 3d 730, 163 Cal. Rptr. 778 (Cal. Ct. App. 1980); see also Sternoff v. California State Bd. of Equal., 103 Cal. App. 3d 828, 164 Cal. Rptr. 715 (Cal. Ct. App. 1980) (holding that a custom packer was providing a service of which the packaging was an integral part). Property that is “hand-carried”into California from out of state is only subject to use tax on the amount that exceeds $800. California SBOE News Release 102-14-G (July 8, 2014); California Tax Publication 53A. Publications (e.g., brochures, catalogs, circulars) containing printed sales messages for goods and services are exempt from use tax in some situations. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6379.5.

Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Local Option Sales and Use Tax

Local Tax Authorized Local jurisdictions in California have the discretion pursuant to Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law to impose sales and use taxes on sales of tangible personal property. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7200, et seq. General Authority – Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law The Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax law authorizes cities and counties, at their discretion, through the county board of supervisors to impose a local county, city, or county and city sales and use tax on the sale and use of tangible personal property. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7200; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7201; see also Cal. Rev. &Tax. Code §7202(a); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7202(h)(1); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7203; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7207; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1803(a)(1); California Tax Publication 28. In order to impose the tax, the locality must adopt all of the provisions and amendments of the state sales and use tax law. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7202(b); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7202(c); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7202(h)(2); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7202(h)(3); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7203(a); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7203(b); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7203.2; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1803(a)(1). All California counties have adopted the Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax Law. California Tax Publication 71. The tax is imposed at a rate of 1.25 percent at the county level, and 1 percent at the city level. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7202(a); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7202(h). When determining the amount of local sales and use tax, a credit is given against the county tax for any city tax that is paid. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7202(h). In March 2004, California voters approved Proposition 57, the Economic Recovery Bond Act. In implementing Proposition 57, California established a “revenue exchange period” during which county and city tax rates were reduced by 0.25 percent. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7203.1(a)(1); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7203.1(a)(2); California Tax Publication 28. The “revenue exchange period”is the period beginning on July 1, 2004, and ending on the first day of the quarter that begins 90 days after the Director of Finance declares that all the bonds issued causing this rate change and ancillary obligations have been paid, retired, or otherwise provided for. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7203.1(b); see also Cal. Gov. Code §99006(b). The change of local tax rates is not a true change in rates; instead, it is a reallocation of the proceeds. During the “revenue exchange period,” 0.25 percent of the local tax was shifted to the state. This shift was accomplished administratively by the Department of Equalization. California Tax Publication 28. The Director of Finance confirmed that the bonds associated with Proposition 57 have been paid off. Thus, the provisions of the Economic Recovery Bond Act expire effective Dec. 31, 2015. As a result, beginning Jan. 1, 2016, the 0.25 percent tax rate reduction for localities shifts back to local agencies, who are entitled to receive their 1 percent Bradley-Burns local sales and use tax for transactions occurring within their jurisdictions. California SBOE Special Notice L-432 (Nov. 2015). Effective Jan. 1, 2016, cities and counties may not enter into agreements that would directly or indirectly result in the payment, transfer, diversion or rebate of any sales and use tax revenue generated under the Bradley-Burns Uniform Sales and Use Tax Law to any person for any purpose when:• the agreement results in a reduction of the amount of local sales and use tax revenue that, absent the agreement, would otherwise be received by another local agency; and • the retailer continues to maintain a physical presence within the jurisdiction of the other local agency. Cal. Gov. Code §53084.5(a), as amended by 2015 Cal. S.B. 533, §2, effective Jan. 1, 2016. A local agency entering an agreement that would reduce the amount of revenue received by another local agency must post the agreement on its website at least 30 days before approval of the agreement, and must provide 60 days' notice of the proposed agreement to the other local agency via certified mail. Additionally, such local agency is required to post on its website any agreements, including agreements entered into before Jan. 1, 2016, that remain in effect on or after that date, that result in the reduction of local sales and use tax revenue to another city, county or city and county. Cal. Gov. Code §53084.5(b), as amended by 2015 Cal. S.B. 533, §2, effective Jan. 1, 2016. Redevelopment Agencies and Bradley-Burns Uniform Sales and Use Tax Law Between Jan. 1, 1986, and Jan. 1, 1994, California cities had the authority to create redevelopment agencies. The redevelopment agencies could impose a sales and use tax at a rate of 1 percent or less, and it was credited against the city's sales and use tax. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7202(h)(1); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7203.1(a)(2); see also California Tax Publication 28. If a taxpayer owed any other local taxes on a purchase within a redevelopment agency's area of control, then the state credited the taxpayer for taxes that it paid to the redevelopment agency. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7202.8; see also California Tax Publication 28. As part of California's 2011 Budget Act, the Legislature dissolved all redevelopment agencies in California. At that time, many of the redevelopment agencies' sponsors provided for successor agencies to wind down the former redevelopment agencies, pay enforceable obligations, and remit unencumbered balances to the county auditor-controller. The county auditor-controllor would then distribute the funds to local taxing entities, such as cities, counties, special districts, and school districts. Bellflower, Cal. v. Cohen, 199 Cal. Rptr. 3d 383 (Cal. Ct. App. 2016) citing Cal. Redevelopment Assn. v. Matosantos, 267 P.3d 580 (Cal. 2011). Successor agencies and sponsoring agencies are separate public entities, even though the sponsoring agency may provide for the governance of successor agency. Bellflower, Cal. v. Cohen, 199 Cal. Rptr. 3d 383 (Cal. Ct. App. 2016) citing Health &Saf. Code § 34173, subd. (g). In Bellflower, Cal. v. Cohen, California cities and the League of California Cities sued the state to challenge Cal. Health & Safety Code § 34179.6(h), passed as part of 2012 Cal. A.B. 1484. See Bellflower, Cal. v. Cohen, 199 Cal. Rptr. 3d 383 (Cal. Ct. App. 2016). The cities sued both in their municipal capacity and as successor agencies of the former redevelopment agencies that they sponsored. The “state”in the case consisted collectively of the State Director of Finance, the State Board of Equalization, the State Controller, and various local government entities. The plaintiffs asserted that § 34179.6(h) violated 2010's Proposition 22, which limited the California legislature's power by stating that “[t]he Legislature may not reallocate, transfer, borrow, appropriate, restrict the use of, or otherwise use the proceeds of any tax imposed or levied by a local government solely for the local government's purposes.”The cities contended that the statute violated Proposition 22 to the extent the it allowed the state and county auditor-controllers to withhold from the cities their shares of sales and use tax revenue and property tax revenue, respectively. See Bellflower, Cal. v. Cohen, 199 Cal. Rptr. 3d 383 (Cal. Ct. App. 2016). The California Court of Appeal agreed and explained that “[i]n passing Proposition 22, the People took away from the Legislature the authority to withhold sales and use tax revenue and property tax revenue from local governments.” The court viewed Proposition 22 as a limitation on the state legislature's authority, “consistent with the People's authority to amend the Constitution.”The court concluded that the Legislature had exceeded its authority under the Constitution when it enacted section 34179.6(h) to the extent the provision permits withholding of local sales and use tax revenue and property tax revenue from local governments. See Bellflower, Cal. v. Cohen, 199 Cal. Rptr. 3d 383 (Cal. Ct. App. 2016). Transactions and Use Tax Law(District Taxes) California law, known as the “Transactions and Use Tax Law,” authorizes the imposition of local district taxes for general or specific purposes on the sale and use of tangible personal property within a district. See California SBOE Special Notice L-492 (Feb. 17, 2017); California Tax Publication 388–March 2017. “District” as used for this tax is a city, county, city and county, or other governmental entity authorized to impose a transactions and use tax. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7252; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1828(a)(2); California Tax Publication 44. The procedures for a locality to impose the general tax versus a specific tax differ and are discussed below. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7251; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7252; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7261; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7285; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7285.8; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7285.9; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7285.91; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7286.24; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7286.59; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7286.43; California Tax Publication 44. District taxes are imposed within special tax districts and are in addition to the Bradley-Burns Uniform Local Sales and Use Tax. California Tax Publication 44; California Tax Publication 28; see California SBOE Special Notice L-492 (Feb. 17, 2017); California Tax Publication 388–March 2017; see, e.g., Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7291, as amended by 2016 Cal. A.B. 1665, effective July 1, 2016 (allowing the Contra Costa Transportation Authority to impose a 0.5 percent “transactions and use tax” to support the countrywide transportation programs, if the Contra Costa Transportation Authority meets three requirements). “Transaction”as used in this tax means the same as sale in the context of sale and use taxes. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7253; California Tax Publication 44; California Tax Publication 28. In order to impose a general or specific district tax, the locality must adopt all of the provisions and amendments of the state sales and use tax law. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7261(b); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7261(c); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7262(a); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7262(b); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1821; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1823(a)(1); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1823(b)(1). However, the sale or use of tangible personal property by operators of aircraft, to be used or consumed principally outside the county where the sale is made, are exempt from district taxes if the property is to be used directly and exclusively in the use of the aircraft as common carriers of persons or property. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7261(e); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7262(e); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1825(b)(1); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1825(b)(2). Also, the district tax does not apply to a “contract to purchase” or a “continuing lease of tangible personal property” that is for a fixed price pursuant to a contract or lease entered into before the operative date of the district tax ordinance that the purchaser/lessee is obligated to fulfill. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7261(g); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7262(f); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1821(1); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1821(3). The district tax will apply, however, if the contracting parties are not required to fulfill their obligations and the contract provides that each party has an unconditional right to terminate it with notice to the other, regardless of whether that right is exercised. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7261(g); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7262(f). Lastly, the sales component of the district tax does not apply to the sale of property shipped by the seller or a common carrier to a point outside the district. If the purchaser is using the property in a taxing district, then the use tax may apply. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7261(f); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1821(2); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1823(b)(2)(B). The governing authorities may enact more than one district tax, except that no other specific district tax may be enacted by a county that has enacted a specific tax to fund libraries pursuant to Cal. Rev. &Tax Code §7286.59. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7285; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7285.9; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7286.59(a). Through Dec. 31, 2011, the district taxes must be imposed in 0.25 percent increments, except for the county library tax, which can be imposed at a rate of 0.125 percent and the Fresno Zoo Tax, which can be imposed at a rate of 0.1 percent. Beginning Jan. 1, 2012, the increment rate decreases to 0.125 percent. The percentage of tax for all district taxes combined in a city and county cannot exceed a combined rate of 2 percent, unless an exception is authorized by statute. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7251.1; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7285, as amended by 2011 Cal. A.B. 686, effective Jan. 1, 2012; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7285.9, as amended by 2011 Cal. A.B. 686, effective Jan. 1, 2012; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7286.43; California SBOE Special Notice L-492 (Feb. 17, 2017); California Tax Publication 388–March 2017. See 2017 Cal. S.B. 703, effective Oct. 10, 2017 (allowing an exception to the general 2-percent cap on local taxes for the city of Santa Fe and the counties of Alameda and Santa Clara) and 2017 Cal. A.B. 1613, effective Jan. 1, 2018 (allowing an exception to the general 2-percent cap on local taxes for San Mateo County by authorizing additional 0.5 percent local tax to be used for the support of countywide transportation programs). The governing board of a county or the governing body of a city may impose a district tax for general purposes, if approved by two-thirds of the governing authority and a majority vote of the electorate. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7285; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7285.9. However, beginning, Jan. 1, 2015, the governing board of a county may impose a district tax on the entire county or the unincorporated parts of the county for general purposes if approved by two-thirds of the governing authority and a majority vote of the electorate. When the tax will be imposed on the entire county, the majority of the electorate of the entire county must approve the tax. However, when the tax will only be imposed on the unincorporated parts of the county, the majority of the electorate of the unincorporated parts of the county must approve the tax. When the tax is imposed on only the unincorporated parts of the county, the tax collected may only be used for general purposes in the parts of the county where the tax is imposed. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7285. There are five types of specific use taxes:a specific tax where the governing authority determines the use; a specific tax for road systems enacted by a qualified city; a specific tax for the funding of libraries enacted by a county; a specific tax for zoos in the County of Fresno; and a specific tax for a county transportation authority. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7285.5; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7285.91; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7286.24; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7286.43; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7286.59; Cal. Pub. Util. Code §180201. The specific district tax where the governing authority makes the determination as to what specific use the tax will apply, may be enacted by a city or county by approval of two-thirds of the governing authority, two-thirds of the electorate, and an ordinance that includes an expenditure plan describing the specific projects to be funded by the tax revenue. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7285.5(a)(1); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7285.5(a)(3); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7285.91(a); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7285.91(c). The specific road construction district tax may only be enacted by a “qualified city” and can be enacted in addition to the specific tax authorized by §7285.91. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7286.24(a)(1). To enact the tax, the ordinance must be approved by a majority vote of all members of the city counsel and two-thirds vote of the electorate. Additionally, the proceeds must be used for the maintenance, repair, replacement, construction, or reconstruction of the city's road system. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7286.24(a)(1)(A); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7286.24(a)(1)(B); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7286.24(a)(2)(B). “Qualified city” means the cities of Clearlake, Fort Bragg, Point Arena, Ukiah, and Willits. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7286.24(b). The library specific tax is a specific district tax enacted by a county to fund public libraries. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7286.59(a); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7286.59(b). If the library tax is enacted, the county may not enact another specific tax pursuant to §7285.5. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7286.59(a). The statute does not prohibit the county from enacting a general district tax, except any general district tax enacted may not exceed the 2 percent ceiling on all district taxes combined. See Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7286.59(a); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7251.1. To enact this tax, it must be approved by two-thirds of the electorate, the ordinance must specify how the revenue will be spent, and the funds must be used to supplement, not replace, the current funding for public libraries. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7286.59(a)(1); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7286.59(a)(2); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7286.59(a)(4). Specifically, the funds can only be used to construct, acquire, fund programs, or fund operations of public libraries within the county. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7286.59(a)(4). The public library transaction and use tax must be imposed at a rate of 0.125 or 0.25 percent for a period no longer than 16 years. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7286.59(a)(3). The Fresno County Zoo tax, may be enacted at a rate of 0.1 percent. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7286.43. The ordinance enacting the tax must be approved by a two-thirds vote of all members of the governing authority of the county; a two-thirds vote of the electorate; and the ordinance imposing the tax must require that all of the revenue is used exclusively for the support of zoos, zoological facilities, and related zoological purposes within the county of Fresno. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7286.43(a); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7286.43(b); Cal. Pub. Util. Code §130350.5, as added by 2015 Cal. S.B. 767, effective Jan. 1, 2016. The last specific tax is the transportation authority tax. A county may enact a district tax by a two-thirds vote of the county government and a majority vote of the electorate. A county transportation expenditure plan must also be adopted to impose the tax. Cal. Pub. Util. Code §180201. The ordinance imposing the tax must state both the rate and how the funds will be used. The rate may be in 0.25 percent increments and cannot exceed a maximum rate of one percent, unless otherwise provided. Cal. Pub. Util. Code §180202; Cal. Pub. Util. Code §180202. The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority is given special permission to impose the tax at a rate of .0125 percent. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7262.3.

The counties of San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara, pursuant to a vote of the Peninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board, and approval by residents, are permitted to impose a regional retail transactions and use tax not to exceed 0.125 percent to fund the Caltrain rail service. This authorization allows an exception to the 2-percent cap on the combined rate of all taxes imposed in a county. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7286.65, as added by 2017 Cal. S.B. 797, effective Jan. 1, 2018. The nine counties that are affected by the Bay Area County Traffic and Transportation Funding Act are authorized to impose 0.5 percent or 1 percent retail transaction and use tax. The Act allows the county to exceed the statutory tax rate allowed to be imposed by the counties under the Transactions and Use Tax Law. For counties that approve the tax, the ordinance to increase the tax will go into effect at the close of polls the day the ordinance is passed. Cal. Pub. Util. Code §131102, as amended by 2013 Cal. A.B. 1112; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7295, as added by 2015 Cal. S.B. 705, effective Jan. 1, 2016.

District Use Tax Collection Requirement for Retailers Effective April 25, 2019, all retailers (whether in-state or remote) that are registered (or required to be registered) with the state, and that meet specified sales or transaction thresholds must collect and remit any applicable district use taxes. The district use tax thresholds mirror the state's economic nexus thresholds, applying to retailers whose sales into the state exceed $500,000. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7262(a), as amended by 2019 Cal. A.B. 147, effective April 1, 2019; but see 2019 Cal. S.B. 92, §10(g), effective June 27, 2019 (changing the effective date of the provision from April 1, 2019, to April 25, 2019); California Tax Publication 542 - Edition 9; California CDTFA Special Notice L-632 (April 2019), superseding California CDTFA Special Notice L-591 (December 2018); California CDTFA News Release NR 18-59 (Dec. 11, 2018). Bradley-Burns & District Tax Differences The primary differences between the district taxes and the Bradley-Burns uniform local sales and use taxes are:• The district tax is not applicable to the gross receipts from the sale or lease of tangible personal property that the seller or the lessor is obligated to furnish for a fixed price pursuant to a contract entered into before the operative date of the district tax ordinance. • The district sales tax does not apply to gross receipts from the sale of property to be used outside the district when the property is shipped to a point outside the district, pursuant to the contract of sale, by delivery to such point by the retailer or his agent, or by delivery by the retailer to a carrier for shipment to a consignee at such point. If thereafter the purchaser brings the property into the district for use and uses it there, the district use tax may apply and the purchaser may be required to pay that tax. • The use tax of a district is not applicable to the storage, use or other consumption in the district of tangible personal property that the purchaser or lessee is obligated to purchase or lease for a fixed price pursuant to a contract or lease entered into before the operative date of the district tax ordinance. • The district use tax must be collected by retailers engaged in business in the district and paid to the board when the retailer ships or delivers the property sold into the district or participates within the district in making the sale. The state and Bradley-Burns uniform local use tax must be collected by retailers engaged in business in this state. • Retailers of vehicles, aircraft, or undocumented vessels are engaged in business in a district imposing a state-administered district tax and are required to collect the use tax from the purchaser and pay it to the board when such vehicles, aircraft or undocumented vessels are registered or licensed in that district. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, §1821. Voter Approval and Local Taxes in California California law, through voter initiatives, has restricted local governing bodies from enacting or increasing local taxes without approval from the voters. California Legislative Analyst's Office, Understanding Proposition 218 (Dec. 1996); see Jensen v. Santa Clara Valley Transp. Auth., No. H044974, 2018 BL 384603 (Cal. Ct. App. Oct. 18, 2018) (discussing authorization for voter-approved sales and use tax measure). The result of these various initiatives is to require that all local taxes enacted for general purposes be approved by majority of the electorate and that all special taxes be approved by two-thirds of the electorate. Cal. Gov. Code §53722; Cal. Gov. Code §53723; Cal. Gov. Code §53724 as enacted by Proposition 62 (1986); California Legislative Analyst's Office, Understanding Proposition 218 (Dec. 1996). The requirement that general taxes be imposed by majority vote was first imposed by the voters in Proposition 62, but only on general law cities and counties. Cal. Gov. Code §53723; Cal. Gov. Code §53724 as enacted by Proposition 62 (1986); California Legislative Analyst's Office, Understanding Proposition 218 (Dec. 1996). The majority vote requirement was later expanded to apply to charter cities by Proposition 218. Cal. Const. art. XIII C, §1(b); Cal. Const. art. XIII C, §2(b) as enacted by Proposition 218 (1996); California Legislative Analyst's Office, Understanding Proposition 218 (Dec. 1996). The requirement that special taxes be enacted by two-thirds approval of the electorate was first imposed by Proposition 13, codified by Proposition 62, and expanded by Proposition 218. Cal. Gov. Code §53722 as enacted by Proposition 62 (1986); Cal. Const. art. XIII A §3(a) as amended by Proposition 13 (1978); Cal. Const. art. XIII A, §4 (amended by Proposition 13 (1978)); Cal. Const. art. XIII D, §3(a)(2) as enacted by Proposition 218 (1996); California Legislative Analyst's Office, Understanding Proposition 218 (Dec. 1996). Taxes as used in these initiatives include sales, hotel occupancy, and utility user's taxes. California Legislative Analyst's Office, Understanding Proposition 218 (Dec. 1996). A tax is a general tax if the revenue from the tax can be used for any governmental purpose, and a tax is a special tax if the revenue from the tax is used for a specific purpose. Cal. Const. art. XIII C, §1(a); Cal. Const. art. XIII C, §1(c) as enacted by Proposition 218 (1996); California Legislative Analyst's Office, Understanding Proposition 218 (Dec. 1996). The voter requirements for general taxes do not apply to taxes enacted before Jan. 1, 1995. Thus, general taxes enacted before this date, which were not subject to voter approval, are still valid. Cal. Const. art. XIII C, §2(c) as enacted by Proposition 218 (1996); California Legislative Analyst's Office, Understanding Proposition 218 (Dec. 1996). Los Angeles Measure H In March 2017, voters in Los Angeles County approved a measure, known as Measure H, to authorize a 0.25-percent county sales and use tax for 10 years for the purpose of funding programs to prevent and combat homelessness. In June 2017, the state passed legislation declaring that the Measure H tax is valid and authorized under Cal. Rev. &Tax. Code §7285.5. The tax will be collected in districts of the county where the current aggregate tax rate is 0.25 percent under the 10.25 percent ceiling specified in Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7251.1. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7286.40, as added by 2017 Cal. S.B. 96, effective June 27, 2017; California CDTFA News Release NR 17-14 (Sept. 20, 2017). Local Grocery Tax Ban Effective June 28, 2018, local taxing jurisdictions may not impose certain taxes on groceries. Taxes, fees, and assessments imposed prior to Jan. 1, 2018 are not affected, but local taxes, fees, and assessments imposed after Jan. 1, 2018, are inoperative as of June 28, 2018. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7284.12, as added by 2017 Cal. A.B. 1838, §1 effective June 28, 2018; California CDTFA Special Notice L-597 (Jan. 2019). Specifically, no local tax may imposed on groceries after Jan. 1, 2018, unless:• the tax, fee, or other assessment is generally applicable to a broad range of businesses, business activity, or products; and • the tax, fee, or other assessment does not establish or rely on a classification related to or involving groceries or a subset of groceries for purposes of establishing or otherwise resulting in a higher tax rate due to that classification. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7284.12, as added by 2017 Cal. A.B. 1838, §1 effective June 28, 2018. “Groceries” are defined as any raw or processed food or beverage intended for human consumption, including the packaging, wrapper, container, or any ingredient thereof. Examples include, but are not limited to, meat, poultry, fish, fruits, vegetables, grains, bread, milk, cheese, and other dairy products, or any carbonated or noncarbonated nonalcoholic beverages. California CDTFA Special Notice L-597 (Jan. 2019). The definition of “groceries” does not include alcoholic beverages, cannabis, cannabis products, cigarettes, tobacco products, and electronic cigarettes. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7284.10, as added by 2017 Cal. A.B. 1838, §1 effective June 28, 2018 and as amended by 2017 Cal. S.B. 872, §1 effective June 28, 2018. BNA-SUTN CA 1.1.3.

Yes California imposes several excise taxes that operate similarly to the state sales tax. See Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7392. Excise Taxes California's excise taxes that function in a manner similar to the state's transactional sales and use tax include: • excise taxes on the use or sale of aircraft jet fuel; Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §7392. • the surcharge on consumption of electrical energy in the state purchased from an electric utility, or the U.S. or an agency thereof; Cal. Rev. & Tax.

Replacement Taxes The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement prohibits member states from imposing a “prohibited replacement tax” which is a tax outside of the sales and use tax that is imposed on products defined in the Agreement. Generally, the Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board will make a finding regarding whether or not a member state has imposed a replacement tax. Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Governing Board, Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement as amended through Dec. 16, 2016, Section 334 and Rule 334 of the Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board,Rules and Procedures.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Historical Information

Est. 1933 California enacted its sales tax Aug. 1, 1933, at an initial rate of 2.5 percent. California Dept. of Tax &Fee Admin., History of Statewide Sales and Use Tax Rates. The state's complementary use tax was enacted on July 1, 1935. California Tax Publication 306. In 1955, the Bradley-Burns Local Sales and Use Tax Law authorized counties to impose a sales and use tax, and as of Jan. 1, 1962, all counties adopted ordinances for the California State Board of Equalization to collect local taxes. Historically, the state-level sales and use tax rates have ranged from 2.5 percent to the current state rate of 6.25 percent. Since 1962, local rates have ranged between 1 and 1.25 percent. The statewide sales and use tax rate for 2016 is 7.5 percent. California Dept. of Tax &Fee Admin., History of Statewide Sales and Use Tax Rates. Sales and use tax revenues collected for fiscal year 2014-15 totaled $52.1 billion. California Tax Publication 306. The State Board of Equalization (BOE) was created by the state's legislature in 1870. In 1879, a state constitutional amendment established the BOE with the charge of ensuring equal and uniform county property assessment practices and of assessing properties of the interconnected railroads. Until July 1, 2017, the BOE administered sales and use taxes, property taxes, special taxes, and the tax appellate program. The BOE is the only elected tax board in the U.S. California State Bd. of Equal., History of the Board of Equalization; California Tax Publication 306; California Tax Publication 216. Beginning July 1, 2017, the newly formed California Department of Tax and Fee Administration took over the BOE's administration of state and local sales and use taxes, as well as other BOE duties.

Economic Nexus, CDTFA & OTA Transition Effective April 1, 2019, an out-of-state retailer must collect and remit use tax if such retailer or persons related to the retailer makes sales into the state of more than $500,000. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6203(c)(4)(a), as amended by 2019 Cal. A.B. 147, effective April 1, 2019. In addition, effective Oct. 1, 2019, marketplace facilitators are considered the seller and retailer for each sale they facilitate through their marketplace and must register and collect sales tax. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6042 and Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6043, both added by 2019 Cal. A.B. 147, effective April 1, 2019. CDTFA & OTA Transition In June 2017, legislation was approved to transfer many of the duties of the State Board of Equalization to a newly formed department, the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA). Cal. Gov. Code §15570 and Cal. Gov. Code §15570.22, as added by 2017 Cal. A.B. 102, effective July 1, 2017. The CDTFA took over responsibility from the BOE for the administration of California's sales and use taxes as of July 1, 2017. The transfer of information from the BOE website to the CDTFA website is expected to take place over time, as is the transfer of online forms and registration applications. California Dept. of Tax &Fee Admin., Transition Frequently Asked Questions (July 14, 2017). Until Dec. 31, 2017, the BOE will conduct appeals on all tax and fee programs in the state of California. Beginning Jan. 1, 2018, the newly created Office of Tax Appeals (OTA) will conduct appeals for all tax and fee programs not covered by the constitutional authority of the BOE, which includes sales and use taxes. Cal. Gov. Code §15670 and Cal. Gov. Code §15674, as added by 2017 Cal. A.B. 102, effective July 1, 2017; California Dept. of Tax & Fee Admin., Transition Frequently Asked Questions (July 14, 2017). Any statutory reference to the BOE or “the board” for purposes of the sales and use tax refers to the CDTFA as of July 1, 2017. Cal. Gov. Code §15570.20 and Cal. Gov. Code §15570.24, as added by 2017 Cal. A.B. 102, effective July 1, 2017. Expansion of Tax Base California may consider an expansion of its tax base to include currently un-taxed services, as the BOE issued a report in April 2015, at the request of a state Senate committee, estimating the potential revenue from taxation of such services. California SBOE, Revenue Estimate (April 14, 2015). In response to a request from California's Senate Committee on Governance and Finance, the BOE prepared revenue estimates on all currently non-taxable services. Estimate of Potential Revenue to be Derived from Taxation of Currently Non-taxable Services (April 14, 2015). Some of the estimates reached include:• a potential$52.2 billion from the application of sales and use tax to the gross receipts of employers in service industry establishments; • the imposition of sales tax on the gross receipts of non-employer establishments(who represent 82.5 percent of services in California) could generate a potential $5.2 billion; and • a total potential taxable revenue of service-sector employers and non-employers of $122.6 billion, and a total potential general fund revenue of $57.3 billion. Estimate of Potential Revenue to be Derived from Taxation of Currently Non-taxable Services (April 14, 2015). The following services were covered in the report:• support activities for agriculture and forestry; • support activities for mining; • construction; • automobile dealers; • transportation and warehousing; • information; • finance and insurance; • real estate and leasing; • professional, scientific, and technical service; • administrative and support and waste management and remediation services; • educational services; • health care and social assistance; • arts, entertainment, and recreation; • accommodations;and • other services, except public administration. Estimate of Potential Revenue to be Derived from Taxation of Currently Non-taxable Services (April 14, 2015). The 2016 Legislative year has revealed little evidence that California's legislature seeks to establish a broader sales and use tax base by including services among taxable items. Nevertheless, it will be prudent to keep watch on legislative action in that direction. CAEATFA Expiration The sales tax exclusion provided by California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority(CAEATFA) is currently set to expire on Jan. 1, 2021. A report by the California Legislative Analysts Office recommends that the legislature allow the exclusion to expire because it overlaps with the state's more general partial exemption for manufacturing equipment and is difficult to administer.

Defined “Use”is defined as including “the exercise of any right or power over tangible personal property incident to the ownership of that property, and also includes the possession of, or the exercise of any right or power over, tangible personal property by a lessee under a lease.” Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6009. “Storage” is defined to include “any keeping or retention in [California]for any purpose except sale in the regular course of business or subsequent use solely outside [California] of tangible personal property purchased from a retailer.” Cal.

Rev. & Tax. Code §6016; see California Tax Publication 61. “Tangible personal property"includes any leased fixtures if the lessor has the right to remove the fixtures upon breach or termination of the lease, unless the lessor is also the lessor of the realty.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Intangible Property'

Not Defined Although intangible personal property is specifically excluded from the sales price and gross receipts when such property is transferred with tangible personal property pursuant to a technology transfer agreement, California's sales and use tax law does not specifically define “intangible property.” Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6011(c)(10). A “technology transfer agreement” is an agreement under which a person who holds a patent or copyright interest assigns or licenses to another person the right to make and sell a product or to use a process that is subject to the patent or copyright interest. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6011(c)(10); Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6012(c)(10); Lucent Techs., Inc. v. California State Bd. of Equal., 193 Cal. Rptr. 3d 323 (Cal. Ct.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Retailer' or 'Vendor'

Defined In California, “retailer” includes every seller that makes any retail sale of tangible personal property. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6015(a). Specifically, “retailer”means every seller that makes any retail sale or sales of tangible personal property, every person engaged in the business of making retail sales at auction of tangible personal property owned by the person or others, and every person engaged in the business of making sales for storage, use, or other consumption or in the business of making sales at auction of tangible personal property owned by the person or others for storage, use, or other consumption. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6015(a). A “seller”includes every person engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property of a kind the gross receipts from the retail sale of which are required to be included in the measure of the sales tax. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6014; California Tax Publication 61. The word “person”is broadly defined in Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6005 to include any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, assignee for the benefit of creditors, trustee, trustee in bankruptcy, syndicate, the United States, this state, any county, city and county, municipality, district, or other political subdivision of the state, or any other group or combination acting as a unit. Thus, any transfer of property is potentially subject to sales or use tax, as the definition of seller and retailer starts with “any person who.” Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6005. In California, every individual, firm, co-partnership, joint venture, trust, business trust, syndicate, association or corporation making more than two retail sales of tangible personal property during any 12-month period, including sales made in the capacity of assignee for the benefit of creditors, or receiver or trustee in bankruptcy, is considered a retailer in his or its individual, firm, co-partnership, joint venture, trust, business trust, syndicate, associate or corporate capacity. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6019. The purpose of Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6019 is to expand somewhat the definition of retailers in Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6015 Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6015 (basic definition). to include vendors not normally considered to be in the business of selling tangible personal property, but who engage in enough sales transactions to be distinguished from a nonbusiness vendor. A vendor is not a retailer under Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 6019 until the third sale is made in a 12-month period. At the time of the first and second sales, the vendor may not know whether he or she will be a retailer by virtue of this provision. However, sales tax is imposed on the gross receipts from all three sales. Such a vendor should consider providing in the first two sales contracts for sales tax reimbursement if a tax should ultimately be due on the sale. If this is not feasible, the vendor should consider delaying the third sale until after the 12 months have passed.

Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6015(b). However, a newspaper carrier is not a retailer. The retailer is the publisher or distributor for whom the carrier delivers the newspapers. Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code §6015(c). BNA-SUTN CA 1.4.6.
