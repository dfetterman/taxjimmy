Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Tangible Personal Property

Destination In Washington, sourcing refers to the location where a sale or lease is deemed to occur and is subject to retail sales tax. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-145. Washington provides five general sourcing rules. See Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.730(1). First, if the purchaser receives a taxable item purchased at the seller's business location, then the sale is sourced to that business location. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.730(1)(a); Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-193(203)(a); see also Washington Special Notice May 1, 2014 (explaining that the place of sale for a brokered vessel sale is deemed to be the broker's in-state office location). Second, if the purchaser does not receive the item at the seller's business location, then the sale is sourced to the location where receipt occurs(whether by the purchaser, the purchaser's agent or designee, or the purchaser's designated donee), including the location indicated by instructions for delivery to the purchaser or donee, known to the seller. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.730(1)(b). Third, if neither of the first two rules apply, then the sale is sourced to the location indicated in good faith by an address for the purchaser that is available from the seller's business records maintained in the ordinary course of business. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.730(1)(c). Fourth, if the first three rules do not apply, then the sale is sourced to the location indicated in good faith by an address for the purchaser obtained during the consummation of the sale, including the address of a purchaser's payment instrument. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.730(1)(d). Fifth, if the first four rules do not apply, including in situations where the seller lacks sufficient information to apply those provisions, then the location is determined by the address from which tangible personal property was shipped, from which the digital good or digital code or the computer software delivered electronically was first available for transmission by the seller, or from which the service was provided, disregarding for these purposes any location that merely provided the digital transfer of the product sold. This is called origin sourcing. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.730(1)(e); see also Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 14-0244 (Oct. 30, 2015)(taxpayer was liable for Washington sales tax where taxpayer did not retain documentation to verify that items were delivered to buyer outside Washington). Washington also applies origin sourcing to retail sales of watercraft; modular homes, manufactured homes, and mobile homes; and motor vehicles, trailers, semitrailers, and aircraft, other than those that are leased or qualify as transportation equipment. Sales of those items are always sourced to the location from which delivery is made. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.730(7); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 14-0207 (March 31, 2016) ( The Division found the use of Mobile Units by an out-of state taxpayer is sourced to the place of first use in Washington therefore, the taxpayer, as lessee, is liable for use tax when no retail sales tax has been paid on such property). Sourcing for Products Shipped to Package-Receiving Businesses Washington imposes sales and use tax on purchases of property that is delivered to a package-receiving business (i.e., a business that accepts and stores shipped purchases for future pick-up) on behalf of an unrelated Canadian resident. Because the Canadian buyer picks up his or her purchased item in Washington and then takes it to Canada, the sale does not qualify as an export sale. Further, the goods are not delivered into the export stream as required by Wash. Admin. Code § 458-20-193C. Washington Tax Topics –Package-Receiving Businesses. Record-Keeping Requirement A seller must retain in its records documents used in the ordinary course of the seller's business to show that the seller knows the location of where the purchaser received goods. Wash. Admin. Code § 458-20-193(203)(b); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 14-0244 (Oct. 30, 2015). Those documents include:• instructions for delivery to the seller indicating where the purchaser wants the goods delivered, provided on a sales contract, sales invoice, or any other document used in the seller's ordinary course of business showing the instructions for delivery; • a waybill, bill of lading or other contract of carriage indicating where delivery occurs, if shipped by a shipping company; or • a trip-sheet signed by the person making delivery for the seller, if shipped by the seller using the seller's own transportation equipment. Wash. Admin. Code § 458-20-193(203)(b); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 14-0244 (Oct. 30, 2015). Without such documentation, a seller's claim that it delivered its products to locations outside of Washington or is otherwise eligible for an exemption would be denied. Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 16-0409 (Nov. 30, 2017). BNA-SUTN WA 4.1.1.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Services

Destination Generally, when a customer purchases retail services at the seller's business location, the sale is sourced to that business location. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-145; Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.730(1)(a). Sourcing of Telecommunication Services Generally The sale of telecommunications services sold on a call-by-call basis is sourced to each level of taxing jurisdiction where the call originates and terminates in that jurisdiction or each level of taxing jurisdiction where the call either originates or terminates and in which the service address is also located. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.520(2). Sourcing of Prepaid Calling Service When a prepaid calling service is received by the purchaser at business locations of the seller, the sale is sourced to that business location. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.520(3)(c)(i). However, if the calling service is not received by the purchaser at the seller's business location the sale is sourced to the location where the purchaser receives the call. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.520(3)(c)(ii). If the sale is not sourced to either of those locations, then the source is the address of the purchaser as indicated on the business records of the seller. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.520(3)(c)(iii). If no other address exists for the purchaser, the sale of the prepaid calling card service is sourced to the location of the purchaser's payment instrument. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.520(3)(c)(iv). In the event that no information can be obtained with regard to the purchase of the property, the sale is sourced according to the location from which the service was provided, disregarding any location that merely provided the digital transfer of the product sold. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.520(3)(c)(v). This includes the location associated with a mobile telephone number in the case of a sale of prepaid wireless calling service. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.520(3)(c)(vi). Sourcing of Private Communication Services Services for separate charges related to a customer channel termination point are sourced to each level of jurisdiction where the customer channel termination point is located. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.520(3)(d)(i). If all customer termination points are located entirely within one taxing jurisdiction the service is sourced to the location of termination. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.520(3)(d)(ii). Conversely, service for segments of a channel between two customer channel termination points, located and charged separately in different jurisdictions, is sourced 50 percent in each jurisdiction a termination point is located. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.520(3)(d)(iii). In the event that segments of a channel are located in more than one jurisdiction and are not separately billed, the service is sourced to each jurisdiction based on a percentage equal to the number of customer channel termination points in the jurisdiction divided by the total number of customer channel termination points. Sourcing of Repair Services for Nonresidents Repair services rendered with respect to tangible personal property for a nonresident, where the property is delivered outside of Washington, are nontaxable. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0265 (2015) repealed July 24, 2015, but sourcing rules under Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.730(1) lead to the same result; Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-173. In order to qualify for the exemption, the seller must retain proof that there was an agreement for delivery of the property outside of Washington and that delivery was made outside Washington. Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 16-0282 (Sept. 1, 2017). BNA-SUTN WA 4.1.2.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Leases and Rentals

Depends In Washington, sourcing refers to the location where a lease is deemed to occur and is subject to retail sales tax. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-145. A lease of tangible personal property, equipment, and motor vehicles, trailers, or aircraft that do not qualify as “transportation equipment,” that does not require recurring periodic payments, is sourced to the location where the customer takes possession of the property. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.730(1). Recurring periodic lease payments for tangible personal property other than exempt transportation equipment or motor vehicles, trailers, semitrailers, or aircraft that do not qualify as exempt transportation equipment are sourced as follows:(1) The first payment for the leased property is sourced to the location where the lessee takes possession of the property. (2) The remaining periodic payments are sourced to the primary property location. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.730(2); Washington Excise Tax Advisory 3185.2014 (Jan. 16, 2014). The “primary property location”is a key factor in determining how such leases are sourced. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.730(2); Washington Excise Tax Advisory 3185.2014 (Jan. 16, 2014). The “primary property location” is the address for the property provided by the lessee that is available to the lessor from its records maintained in the ordinary course of business, when use of the address does not constitute bad faith. This location is not altered by intermittent use at different locations. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.730(2)(a); Washington Excise Tax Advisory 3185.2014 (Jan. 16, 2014). If a periodic lease payment is sourced to Washington, the payment is subject to sales tax. If the lessee uses the property outside the state within the period covered by the lease payment, the primary property location controls for sales tax purposes. The lease payment is not apportioned based on time spent inside or outside of Washington. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.730(2)(a); Washington Excise Tax Advisory 3185.2014 (Jan. 16, 2014). If a periodic lease payment is sourced to a location outside of Washington, the lessor is not required to collect Washington's sales tax. The lessee may, however, incur a use tax liability if the lessee uses the property in Washington. Wash. Rev. Code §82.12.020; Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 14-0207 (March 31, 2016) (finding the use of mobile video and television production units by an out-of state taxpayer is sourced to the place of first use in Washington, therefore, the taxpayer, as lessee, is liable for use tax when no retail sales tax has been paid on such property); Washington Excise Tax Advisory 3185.2014 (Jan. 16, 2014). Motor Vehicles, Trailers, Semitrailers, and Aircraft All recurring periodic lease payments for motor vehicles, trailers, semitrailers, and aircraft that do not qualify as exempt transportation equipment are sourced to the primary property location, regardless of where the lessee takes possession of the property. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.730(3)(a); Washington Excise Tax Advisory 3185.2014 (Jan. 16, 2014). The primary property location will be as indicated by an address for the property provided by the lessee that is available to the lessor from its records maintained in the ordinary course of business, when use of this address does not constitute bad faith. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.730(4). The property location is not altered by intermittent use at different locations, such as use of business property that accompanies employees on business trips and service calls. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.730(4); Washington Excise Tax Advisory 3185.2014 (Jan. 16, 2014). For non-transportation aircraft, the primary property location is presumed to be the location where the aircraft is primarily based or hangared and ready for use. Washington Tax Topics – Primary Property Location - Leased Non-transportation Aircraft. In the case of a lease that does not require recurring periodic payments, the payment is sourced the same as a retail sale, rather than according to the primary property location. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.730(3)(b); Washington Excise Tax Advisory 3185.2014 (Jan. 16, 2014). BNA-SUTN WA 4.1.3.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Local Sourcing

Destination Local sales tax is allocated in the same manner as the state sales tax. The term sourcing refers to the location where a sale or lease is deemed to occur and therefore where it is subject to tax. Wash. Rev. Code §82.14.490; Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.730; Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-145(1). In July of 2008, Washington adopted destination based sourcing rules for most retail sales. 2008 Wash. S.B. 5089, effective July 1, 2008; Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-145. The sourcing rules apply to both state and local level transactions. Wash. Rev. Code §82.14.490; Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.730. The rules are summarized as follows: • (1)When a purchaser receives a taxable item or service at a business location of the seller, the sale is sourced to that business location; Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.730(1)(a). • (2)When the purchaser does not receive the taxable item or service at a business location, the sale is sourced to the location where receipt by the purchaser occurs. This includes a location indicated by instructions for delivery that are known to the seller; Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.730(1)(b). • (3)If (1) and (2) do not apply, the sale is sourced to the purchaser's address, indicated by the business records of the seller; Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.730(1)(c). • (4)If (1), (2), and (3) do not apply, the sale is sourced to the location indicated by an address for the purchaser obtained during the sale's consummation; Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.730(1)(d). • (5)If none of the above apply, the location of the sale is sourced to the address where the taxable property was shipped or the taxable service was provided. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.730(1)(e). Upon enactment of the new sourcing rules, the Washington legislature created a Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Mitigation Account. Wash. Rev. Code §82.14.495(1); Wash. Rev. Code §82.14.495(2). Under this authority, the state treasury may transfer amounts from the general state fund to local taxing jurisdictions. The redistribution is based on the treasury's determination of a local taxing jurisdiction's net annual loss resulting from the change in sourcing laws. Wash. Rev. Code §82.14.495; Wash. Rev. Code §82.14.500. The account's purpose is to diminish the negative fiscal impact that results from the shift in revenues among taxing jurisdictions. Wash. Rev. Code §82.14.495. Vessels For brokered vessel transactions, the place of sale is the “selling broker's” in-state office location as the selling broker is the buyer's agent. Washington Special Notice Jan. 1, 2017. BNA-SUTN WA 4.1.4.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Credit for Tax Paid to Another Jurisdiction

Yes Washington allows a reciprocal use tax credit up to the amount of any sales or use tax paid to another state. In addition to state taxes paid, Washington allows a taxpayer to take a credit against Washington state taxes due for local taxes paid as well as taxes paid to the District of Columbia. Wash. Rev. Code §82.12.035; Wash. Admin. Code § 458-20-178(8); Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Taxability Matrix, Washington (version 2018.0). BNA-SUTN WA 4.2.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Temporary Presence, In-Transit Property Tangible Personal Property First Used Out-of-state

Depends The use of a taxable item on which the person using the item has already paid a sales or use tax is exempt from use tax. Wash. Rev. Code §82.12.020(2). Household goods, private motor vehicles and services rendered upon such property are exempt from use tax if used in-state by a Washington resident or a nonresident member of the armed forces that previously acquired and used the item or service in another state of which she was a resident for more than 90 days prior to entering Washington. Wash. Rev. Code §82.12.0251(3); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 18-0124 (May 8, 2018) (”resident” means a person who manifests an intent to live or be located in Washington for more than a temporary or transient basis); see Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 13-0175 (June 11, 2013) (member of the armed forces that purchased a motor vehicle more than 90 days prior to entering Washington did not qualify for exemption where he first took possession of the motor vehicle in Washington and, therefore, did not satisfy the requirement of having also used the motor vehicle more than 90 days prior to entering the state). BNA-SUTN WA 4.3.1.

==================================================

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Temporary Presence, In-Transit Property Tangible Personal Property Temporarily Stored In-state

Depends Whether tangible personal property temporarily stored in Washington is taxable depends on whether it is in import or export. Wash. Rev. Code §82.04.610(1); Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.990; Wash. Rev. Code §82.12.010(7)(c). Tangible personal property in import or export commerce is not subject to sales and use taxes. Other tangible personal property temporarily stored in Washington is taxable. Wash. Rev. Code §82.04.610(1); Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.990. Additionally, special rules apply to tangible personal property brought into Washington by a person engaged in business outside Washington for 180 days or less in a consecutive 365 day period and temporarily used for business purposes in Washington. The value of such property for use tax purposes is the reasonable rental value of said property. The reasonable rental value is normally determined by the rental price or the fair market rental value of similar products of like quality and character of the property, which is often calculated on a monthly basis. Wash. Rev. Code §82.12.010(7)(c); Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-178(4)(i); Washington Excise Tax Advisory 3200.2017 (April 18, 2017). There is a separate taxable event each time tangible personal property from outside Washington is used in Washington for 180 days or less for business purposes. Property may be used in Washington on a temporary basis on multiple occasions. Wash. Rev. Code §82.12.010(7)(c); Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-178(4)(i); Washington Excise Tax Advisory 3200.2017 (April 18, 2017). BNA-SUTN WA 4.3.2.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Temporary Presence, In-Transit Property Tangible Personal Property Purchased for Use Out-of-state

Depends Subject to certain conditions, Washington exempts from retail sales tax sales to nonresidents of tangible personal property, digital goods, and digital codes. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0273(1), as amended by 2019 Wash. S.B. 5997, effective July 1, 2019; Washington Special Notice May 31, 2019. This exemption applies when the following conditions are satisfied:• the property is for use out-of-state; • the purchaser is a bona fide resident of a province or territory of Canada or a state, territory, or possession of the United States, other than the state of Washington; and o such state, possession, territory, or province does not impose, or have imposed on its behalf, a generally applicable retail sales tax, use tax, value added tax, gross receipts tax on retailing activities, or similar generally applicable tax, of three percent or more; or o if imposing such a tax, provides an exemption for sales to Washington residents by reason of their residence; and • the purchaser agrees, when requested, to grant the department of revenue access to records and other forms of verification at his or her place of residence to assure that such purchases are not first used substantially within Washington. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0273(1), as amended by 2019 Wash. S.B. 5997, effective July 1, 2019. Effective July 1, 2019, any person claiming this exemption must pay the state and local sales tax to the seller at the time of purchase and then request a remittance from the department. A request for remittance must include proof of the person's status as a nonresident at the time of the purchase for which a remittance is requested. The request for a remittance must also include any additional information and documentation as required by the department, which may include a description of the item purchased for which a remittance is requested, the sales price of the item, the amount of sales tax paid on the item, the date of the purchase, the name of the seller, the physical address where the sale took place, and copies of sales receipts showing the qualified purchases. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0273(3)(a), as amended by 2019 Wash. S.B. 5997, effective July 1, 2019; Washington Special Notice May 31, 2019. Beginning Jan. 1, 2020, through Dec. 31, 2020, a person may request a remittance from the department for state sales taxes paid by the person on qualified retail purchases made in Washington between July 1, 2019, and Dec. 31, 2019. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0273(4)(a)(i), as amended by 2019 Wash. S.B. 5997, effective July 1, 2019. Beginning Jan. 1, 2021, a person may request a remittance from the department during any calendar year for state sales taxes paid by the person on qualified retail purchases made in Washington during the immediately preceding calendar year only. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0273(4)(a)(ii), as amended by 2019 Wash. S.B. 5997, effective July 1, 2019. The remittance request, including proof of nonresident status and any other documentation and information required by the department, must be provided in a form and manner as prescribed by the department. Only one remittance request may be made by a person per calendar year. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0273(4)(b), as amended by 2019 Wash. S.B. 5997, effective July 1, 2019. The total amount of a remittance request must be at least twenty-five dollars. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0273(4)(c), as amended by 2019 Wash. S.B. 5997, effective July 1, 2019. Any person making fraudulent statements to the department, which includes the offer of fraudulent or fraudulently procured identification or fraudulent sales receipts, in order to receive a remittance of retail sales tax is guilty of perjury and is ineligible to receive any further remittances from the department. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0273(5)(a), as amended by 2019 Wash. S.B. 5997, effective July 1, 2019. Any person obtaining a remittance of retail sales tax from the department by providing proof of identification or sales receipts not the person's own, or counterfeit identification or sales receipts is: (i) liable for repayment of the remittance, including interest from the date the remittance was transmitted to the person until repaid in full; (ii) liable for a civil penalty equal to the greater of one hundred dollars or the amount of the remittance;and (iii) ineligible to receive any further remittances from the department. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0273(5)(b), as amended by 2019 Wash. S.B. 5997, effective July 1, 2019. Any person assisting another person in obtaining a remittance by providing another's identification or sales receipts, or counterfeit identification or sales receipts, is jointly and severally liable for repayment of the remittance with interest and for penalties and is also ineligible to receive any further remittances from the department. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0273(5)(c), as amended by 2019 Wash. S.B. 5997, effective July 1, 2019. A person who receives a refund of sales tax from the seller for any reason with respect to a purchase made in Washington is not entitled to a remittance for the tax paid on the purchase. A person who receives both a remittance and a refund of sales tax from the seller with respect to the same purchase must immediately repay the remittance to the department with interest. A person who receives a remittance with respect to a purchase for which the person had, at the time the person submitted the application for a remittance, already received a refund of sales tax from the seller is also liable for a civil penalty equal to the greater of one hundred dollars or the amount of the remittance obtained and is ineligible to receive any further remittances from the department. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0273(6), as amended by 2019 Wash. S.B. 5997, effective July 1, 2019. This exemption is only for the state portion of the sales tax. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0273(7), as amended by 2019 Wash. S.B. 5997, effective July 1, 2019. This exemption does not apply to sales of marijuana, useable marijuana, or marijuana-infused products. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0273(8), as amended by 2019 Wash. S.B. 5997, effective July 1, 2019. Sales and use tax does not apply to sales of motor vehicles, trailers, or campers to nonresidents for use outside the state if certain requirements are met. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0264(1); Wash. Rev. Code §82.12.0251(2); Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-177(3)(a). More specifically, the vehicle, trailer, or camper must be taken from the point of delivery in Washington to a point outside of Washington under the authority of a one-transit permit used by the director of licensing; or the vehicle, trailer, or camper must be registered and licensed immediately under the laws of the state of the purchaser's residence, may not be used in Washington for more than three months, and must not be required to be registered and licensed under the laws of Washington. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0264(1); Wash. Rev. Code §82.12.0251(2); Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-177(3)(a); Washington Special Notice June 28, 2019. The fact that a taxpayer is a resident of another state does not necessarily make the taxpayer a nonresident of Washington, as a taxpayer may maintain a residence in more than one state. See Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 18-0049 (Feb. 13, 2018). If the vehicle bears Washington state license plates, then the seller must remove the Washington plates before delivering the vehicle and retain evidence of that removal to avoid liability for collection and payment of the retail sales tax. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0264(1); Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-177(3)(a). In all other cases where the vehicle is delivered to a buyer in the state of Washington, the retail sales tax applies and must be collected at the time of sale. The fact that the buyer claims to be a nonresident or that the buyer intends and actually used the vehicle in some other state does not by itself entitle the buyer to the exemption. If the seller licenses or registers the vehicle in Washington on the buyer's behalf the retail sales tax applies. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-177(3). Sale of Parts to Nonresidents Effective June 1, 2019, nonresidents purchasing repair parts at retail are no longer exempt from sales tax at the point of sale, however qualified nonresidents may request a refund of the state portion of sales tax paid. “Qualified nonresidents”means a resident of a state other than Washington, a U.S. possession, or a Canadian province or territory whose sales tax or similar tax is less than three percent. To request a refund, the charge for parts must be separate from labor and other installation charges, and the seller has certified in writing that the charges for parts do not exceed the seller's current retail price or if no retail price is available, does not exceed the seller's cost. Washington Special Notice June 28, 2019. The refund is available for the purchase of parts for a motor vehicle, trailer or camper for the purpose of repair, cleaning, alteration, or improvement. Nonresidents may request refunds beginning Jan. 1, 2020 for purchases made between July 1, 2019 and Dec. 31, 2019. The request must be for $25 or more. Washington Special Notice June 27, 2019.
