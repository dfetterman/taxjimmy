Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Prepared Food Definition of 'Prepared Food'

Defined Summarized briefly, New Jersey defines prepared food to mean food sold in a heated state with two or more ingredients and sold with eating utensils. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3(c)(3); New Jersey Technical Bulletin TB-71. More comprehensively, New Jersey defines “prepared food” as:• food sold in a heated state or heated by the seller; • two or more food ingredients mixed or combined by the seller for sale as a single item, but not including food that is only cut, repackaged, or pasteurized by the seller, or eggs, fish, meat, poultry, or foods containing these raw animal foods requiring cooking by the consumer as recommended by the Food and Drug Administration in Chapter 3, part 401.11 of its Food Code so as to prevent food borne illnesses; or • food sold with eating utensils provided by the seller, including plates, knives, forks, spoons, glasses, cups, napkins, or straws. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3(c)(3); New Jersey Technical Bulletin TB-71. When determining whether food is sold with eating utensils “provided by the seller,” if a business' gross annual sales of food sold in a heated state or heated by the seller and which is the result of the seller mixing or combing two or more food ingredients to make a single item, are more then 75 percent of its total sales of good and food ingredients, excluding alcohol, then utensils merely have to be made available by the seller for a sale to be considered one of “prepared food” which is taxable. If the business exceeds 75 percent and has a kiosk or other area where napkins and utensils are available to customers, all sales are treated as being sold with utensils “provided by the seller” and are taxable as “prepared food.” N.J. Admin. Code tit. 18, §24-12.2A; see New Jersey Letter Ruling LR: 2014-1-SUT (Sept. 9, 2014). If the sale of items contains four or more servings packaged as one item sold for a single price, the “bulk items”do not become prepared food due to the seller having utensils available. N.J. Admin. Code tit. 18, §24-12.2A; see New Jersey Letter Ruling LR: 2014-1-SUT (Sept. 9, 2014). Nonreturnable containers and wrapping supplies, that are used incidental to the delivery of taxable prepared foods to customers, are exempt from tax when purchased by a restaurant. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-8.15; New Jersey Letter Ruling LR: 2013-2-SUT (Sept. 6, 2013). However, restaurants must generally pay sales tax on purchases of taxable items such as utensils, straws, tablecloths, napkins, placemats and janitorial supplies, which are used in their business and not resold or otherwise exempt. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3(a); New Jersey Letter Ruling LR: 2013-2-SUT (Sept. 6, 2013). BNA-SUTN NJ 11.2.2.
