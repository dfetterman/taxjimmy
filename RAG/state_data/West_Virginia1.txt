Destination Generally, West Virginia sources sales of products, including tangible personal property, on a destination basis. W. Va. Code §11-15B-15. Products are defined to include tangible personal property, computer software, digital goods, or a service, or any combination thereof. W. Va. Code §11-15B-15(f). Sellers are required to source sales of products under the general sourcing rules, regardless of whether the product is tangible personal property, custom computer software, a service, or digital goods. W. Va. Code §11-15B-14a(a). However, with respect to use tax, purchasers or lessees are required to remit tax on the use of the product to the taxing jurisdiction of where used. W. Va. Code §11-15B-14a(a). For the purposes of West Virginia's sourcing rules, “receive” and “receipt” mean:• taking possession of tangible personal property; • making first use of services; or • taking possession or making first use of computer software or digital goods, whichever comes first. W. Va. Code §11-15B-14(a). The terms “receive” and “receipt”do not include possession by a shipping company on behalf of a purchaser. W. Va. Code §11-15B-14(b). West Virginia requires retail sales of products, which includes tangible personal property, to be sourced under the following general rules:• when a purchaser receives the product at the seller's business location, the sale is sourced to that business location; W. Va. Code §11-15B-15(a)(1). • when a purchaser does not receive a product at the seller's business location, the sale is sourced to the location where the purchaser receives the product, which includes the location indicated by the seller's instructions for delivery to the purchaser; W. Va. Code §11-15B-15(a)(2). • if the above rules do not apply, the sale is sourced to the purchaser's address known to the seller from business records maintained in the ordinary course of business; W. Va. Code §11-15B-15(a)(3). • if no other rules apply, the sourcing location is the address from which the tangible personal property was shipped or the location from which the service was provided. W. Va. Code §11-15B-15(a)(5). Sourcing of Transportation Equipment The retail sale, lease, or rental of transportation equipment is sourced under the general rules for sourcing retail sales under W. Va. Code §11-15B-15(a). W. Va. Code §11-15B-15(d). Transportation equipment refers to any of the following:• locomotives and railcars utilized for carrying persons or property in interstate commerce; W. Va. Code §11-15B-15(d)(1). • trucks and truck-tractors with a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 pounds or greater, trailers, semitrailers, or passenger buses registered and operated under federal authority to carry persons or property in interstate commerce; W. Va. Code §11-15B-15(d)(2). or • aircraft operated by air carriers under federal or foreign authority to carry persons or property in interstate or foreign commerce. W. Va. Code §11-15B-15(d)(3). Advertising and Promotional Direct Mail Direct mail is printed material delivered or distributed by U.S. mail or other delivery services to a mass audience or to addressees on a mailing list provided by the purchaser or at the direction of the purchaser when the cost of the items is not billed directly to the recipients. To qualify as advertising and promotional direct mail, the primary purpose must be to attract public attention to a product, person, business, or organization, or to attempt to sell, popularize, or secure financial support for a product, person, business, or organization. W. Va. Code §11-15B-2(b)(16); W. Va. Code §11-15B-17(c)(1). If a purchaser of advertising and promotional direct mail provides a seller with a direct pay permit, an exemption certificate, or information showing the jurisdictions to which the advertising and promotional direct mail is to be delivered to recipients, or other approved statement that relieves the seller of tax liability, the purchaser must source the sale to the jurisdictions to which the advertising and promotional direct mail is to be delivered to the recipients. W. Va. Code §11-15B-17(a)(2). If a purchaser of advertising and promotional direct mail does not provide a direct pay permit, exemption certificate, or other statement, but provides the seller with information showing the jurisdictions to which the advertising and promotional direct mail is to be delivered to recipients, the seller must source the sale to the jurisdictions to which the advertising and promotional direct mail is to be delivered. W. Va. Code §11-15B-17(a)(3). If a purchaser does not provide any of the above information to the seller, the sale is sourced to the address from which the advertising and promotional direct mail is shipped. W. Va. Code §11-15B-17(a)(4). Other Direct Mail Generally, sales of other direct mail are sourced to the location indicated by the address for the purchaser that is available from the business records of the seller that are maintained in the ordinary course of the seller's business, when use of this address does not constitute bad faith. W. Va. Code §11-15B-17(b)(1); W. Va. Code §11-15B-15(a)(3). However, if the purchaser provides a direct pay permit, an exemption certificate, or any other statement relieving the seller's tax obligation, the sale is sourced to the jurisdictions to which the other direct mail is to be delivered to the recipients. W. Va. Code §11-15B-17(b)(3). “Other direct mail” is any printed material delivered or distributed by U.S. mail or other delivery services to a mass audience or to addressees on a mailing list provided by the purchaser or at the direction of the purchaser, when the cost of the items are not billed directly to the recipients, that does not qualify as advertising and promotional direct mail. W. Va. Code §11-15B-17(c)(2). Examples of other direct mail are:• transactional direct mail that contains personal information specific to the addressee, such as invoices, bills, statements of account, and payroll advices; • any legally required mailings, such as privacy notices, tax reports, and stockholder reports; and • other non-promotional direct mail delivered to existing or former shareholders, customers, employees, or agents, such as newsletters and informational pieces.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Leases and Rentals

Depends West Virginia sources leases of tangible personal property or custom software based on whether the agreement requires periodic payments. W. Va. Code §11-15B-15(b). Leases and rentals of tangible personal property or custom software are sourced using the rules set forth below.• The first payment under leases or rentals that provide for recurring payments is sourced the same as a retail sale under the provisions of W. Va. Code §11-15B-15(a). Subsequent periodic payments are sourced to the primary property location for each period covered by the payment. W. Va. Code §11-15B-15(b)(1). • Leases or rentals that do not require recurring periodic payments are sourced the same as a retail sale under the provisions of W. Va. Code §11-15B-15(a). W. Va. Code §11-15B-15(b)(2). The “primary property location”is determined by an address provided by the lessee and maintained in the lessor's ordinary business records, when use of such address does not constitute bad faith. The primary property location is not changed by intermittent use of the property in different locations, such as accompanying employees on business trips or service calls. W. Va. Code §11-15B-15(b)(1); see also W. Va. Code §11-15B-15(c)(1) (leases of vehicles). Sourcing of Vehicles Leases The lease or rental of motor vehicles, trailers, and aircraft that are not qualified as transportation equipment are sourced as follows:• for a lease or rental requiring periodic payments, each periodic payment is sourced to the primary property location; W. Va. Code §11-15B-15(c)(1). and • for a lease or rental that does not require recurring periodic payments, the payment is sourced the same as a retail sale under the provisions of W. Va. Code §11-15B-15(a). W. Va. Code §11-15B-15(c)(2). BNA-SUTN WV 4.1.3.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Local Sourcing

Same As State West Virginia's destination-based state-level sourcing rules applicable to retail sales under W. Va. Code §11-15B-15, also apply to municipal sales and use taxes. W. Va. Code §8-13C-4(c)(2). Municipalities in West Virginia are authorized to impose a pension relief municipal sales and service, and use tax and an alternative municipal sales and service tax (in lieu of a business and occupation privilege tax). W. Va. Code §8-13C-4(a); W. Va. Code §8-13C-4(b); W. Va. Code §8-13C-5. Additionally, counties and municipalities may impose special district excise taxes within an economic opportunity development district. W. Va. Code §7-22-12(a); W. Va. Code §8-13B-11(a). These taxes are imposed at the same tax rates as the state consumer sales and service tax. The imposition of a special district excise tax results in an exemption from the state consumer sales and services tax on sales of such items. W. Va. Code §11-15-9f. When a West Virginia retailer collects State sales tax at the time a sale is made but does not collect municipal sales tax because the sale took place in a municipality that does not impose a sales tax, and the purchaser then uses or consumes the products in a municipality that does imposes a sales and use tax, the user owes municipal sales and use tax based on the purchase price of the products used or consumed within the municipality. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-28-4.7.1. BNA-SUTN WV 4.1.4.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Credit for Tax Paid to Another Jurisdiction

Yes In West Virginia, a person is entitled to a credit against tax imposed on the use of a particular item of tangible personal property, custom software, or service, equal to the amount, if any, of sales tax lawfully paid to another state for the acquisition of the property or service. W. Va. Code §11-15A-10a(a); W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-43; Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Taxability Matrix, West Virginia (version 2018.0). The amount of credit allowed may not exceed the amount of use tax imposed on the use of the property in West Virginia. W. Va. Code §11-15A-10a(a); W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-43; Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Taxability Matrix, West Virginia (version 2018.0). Additionally, the credit is allowed only for the amount of motor fuel tax actually paid to another state that exceeds the $4.3 million refundable motor fuel excise tax exemption provided by West Virginia for fuel used in the operation of railroad diesel locomotives in West Virginia. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, § 110-41-5, effective Dec. 31, 2018. For more information about refundable exemptions from West Virginia's motor fuel excise tax, see the Excise Tax Navigator, at West Virginia 8.1.4. The credit allowed under W. Va. Code §11-15A-10a applies to sales taxes paid both to other states and to local jurisdictions of other states. Matkovich v. CSX Transp., Inc., No. 15-0935, 2016 BL 381333, (W. Va. 2016). The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals has ruled that the state's sales tax credit must be granted for both state and local sales taxes paid to other jurisdictions in order for the statute to meet the constitutional requirements of the dormant Commerce Clause. Matkovich v. CSX Transp., Inc., No. 15-0935, 2016 BL 381333, (W. Va. 2016). CSX Transportation sought a credit for sales taxes paid to municipalities in other states for its purchases of motor fuel. West Virginia imposes a use tax, pursuant to W. Va. Code §11-15A-13a, on taxpayers who purchase motor fuel outside the state but use the fuel within the state. CSX was assessed use tax on motor fuel used in West Virginia, and sought a credit against the use tax for sales taxes paid for the motor fuel to other states' local jurisdictions. The court noted that the state's sales tax credit operates as an offset to the motor fuel use tax. The state tax department argued that the credit statute, W. Va. Code §11-15A-10a, applies only to taxes paid to other states, not to taxes paid to states'cities, counties, and other municipalities. Upholding the lower court decision and the decision of the Office of Tax Appeals, the Supreme Court of Appeals found that denial of the credit for sales taxes paid by CSX to other states' municipalities on its motor fuel purchases would unconstitutionally discriminate against interstate commerce. Matkovich v. CSX Transp., Inc., No. 15-0935, 2016 BL 381333, (W. Va. 2016). With respect to local taxes, a credit is allowed against use tax lawfully imposed by another municipality. However, no credit is permitted for sales or use tax levied by West Virginia or another state. W. Va. Code §8-13C-5a; W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-28-3.1.d. BNA-SUTN WV 4.2.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Temporary Presence, In-Transit Property Tangible Personal Property First Used Out-of-state

Exempt West Virginia exempts from use tax the use of tangible personal property brought into the state by a nonresident individual or a business not actually doing business in the state in connection with the establishment of a permanent residence or business in West Virginia. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-9.7. To qualify for the exemption, the property must have been purchased more than 6 months prior to entering the state, or 6 months prior to the establishment of the permanent residence or business, whichever occurs first. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-9.7. Unless another exemption applies, or the amount of sales or use tax paid to another state is equal to or greater than West Virginia's use tax, the use of property relocated in the state that was purchased and used outside the state for less than 6 months is subject to West Virginia's use tax. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-9.7.2. BNA-SUTN WV 4.3.1.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Temporary Presence, In-Transit Property Tangible Personal Property Temporarily Stored In-state

Depends West Virginia does not impose use tax on the use of tangible personal property and custom software that a nonresident individual brings into the state while temporarily in the state or while passing through the state. W. Va. Code §11-15A-3(a)(1); W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-9.5.1. An exception to the exemption is gasoline or special fuel: gasoline or special fuel is subject to use tax generally, but only if not contained in the motor vehicle that is not a motor carrier. Thus, gas in the tank of a car brought into the state by a visiting nonresident for his or her own use is not subject to use tax. W. Va. Code §11-15A-3(a)(1); W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-9.5.1. When a nonresident contractor performs a contract in West Virginia, use tax is imposed on machinery, materials, supplies, and equipment that the contractor has or will have on hand at the time he begins the fulfillment of the contract and for which no West Virginia tax has been paid. W. Va. Code §11-15A-8(b); W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-9.5.1.1. BNA-SUTN WV 4.3.2.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Temporary Presence, In-Transit Property Tangible Personal Property Purchased for Use Out-of-state

Depends West Virginia does not impose use tax on tangible personal property, custom software, or the result of a taxable service to be subsequently transported for use solely outside the state. W. Va. Code §11-15A-1(b)(15). West Virginia specifically excludes from the definition of “use” the keeping, retaining or exercising any right or power over tangible personal property, custom software or the result of a taxable service for the purpose of subsequently transporting it outside West Virginia for use thereafter solely outside the state. W. Va. Code §11-15A-1(b)(15); W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-2.103. Also, West Virginia specifically exempts from its consumers sales and service tax sales of vehicles purchased and delivered in the state but immediately removed from the state, provided the vehicle is titled and registered in another state. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-9.2.24.4. The vehicle must be subject to a tax in another state that is similar to West Virginia's certification of title tax under W. Va. Code §17A-3-4. W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-9.2.24.4; see W. Va. Code §17A-3-4. However, use tax is imposed on the purchase or lease of machinery or equipment or other tangible personal property for use in another state that is then used or consumed in the state. The tax is imposed on the value of the property used or consumed. W. Va. Code §11-15A-2a(c). BNA-SUTN WV 4.3.3.
