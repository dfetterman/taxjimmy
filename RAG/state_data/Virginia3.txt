Topic: Utilities, Fuel, Mining and Natural Resource Extraction, Production, Sale Utilities Other Utilities

Yes Heating Oil For Domestic Consumption Artificial or propane gas, firewood, coal, or heating oil is exempt so long as it is used for domestic consumption. Va. Regs. §10-210-630(A); Va. Code Ann. §58.1-609.10(1); Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 10-259 (Nov. 19, 2010) (charcoal briquettes not exempt from sales tax because not included in list of exempt fuels). “Domestic Consumption”Defined The term “domestic consumption”means the use of artificial or propane gas, firewood, coal, or home heating oil by an individual for other than business, commercial, or industrial purposes. Domestic consumption is restricted to fuels used by individuals; purchases of fuel by groups or organizations will be subject to the tax unless the fuel purchased is for domestic consumption by an individual. However, domestic consumption usage is not restricted to heating purposes, but may also include cooking or heating water. Va. Regs. §10-210-630(B). The term “domestic consumption”includes purchases of fuel by:• an owner or lessee for use in a single-family dwelling in which he or she resides; Va. Regs. §10-210-630(B)(1). • individual residents for use in apartments, townhouses, trailer courts, condominiums, or other multi-family dwellings in which they reside; Va. Regs. §10-210-630(B)(2). and • a condominium or similar owner cooperative association provided such association is comprised solely of the owners of the dwelling and more than 50 percent of the fuel purchased is for use in owner-occupied units. Va. Regs. §10-210-630(B)(3). The term “domestic consumption”does not include purchases by:• nonprofit churches, civic or other charitable groups unless otherwise allowed; Va. Regs. §10-210-630(B)(1). • businesses operated by nonprofit groups; Va. Regs. §10-210-630(B)(2). • profit hospitals, nursing homes, or homes for adults; Va. Regs. §10-210-630(B)(3). • profit schools or institutions of learning; Va. Regs. §10-210-630(B)(4). • lessors of apartments, trailer courts, condominiums, rooming houses, or other multi-family dwellings; fraternities, or sororities; Va. Regs. §10-210-630(B)(5). • hotels, motels, inns, cabins, or lodges; Va. Regs. §10-210-630(B)(6). or • any commercial, business, or industrial operations. Va. Regs. §10-210-630(B)(7). In determining when tax is to be collected by the dealer on a purchase used for both domestic and nondomestic purposes, a principal usage test is applied. A purchase will be classified as exempt if more than 50 percent of the fuel purchased is for domestic consumption. However, if 50 percent or less of the fuel purchased is for domestic consumption, then the entire purchase will be taxable and the tax must be collected by the dealer at the time of the sale. Va. Regs. §10-210-630(C). The ultimate taxability of a fuel purchase depends on its actual usage. The purchaser will be liable for payment to the department of use tax on any portion of a domestic purchase (i.e., a purchase on which no sales tax was paid to the dealer) subsequently used for nondomestic purposes. A purchaser who has paid tax, however, may apply to the department for a refund of tax paid on that portion that is actually used for domestic consumption. Refund claims must be filed on forms prescribed by the department between Jan. 1 and April 15 of the year following the year of purchase. Refund applications pursuant to this exemption will be denied if post-marked after April 15 of the year following the year of purchase. Va. Regs. §10-210-630(C). Multifuel Heating Stoves Beginning July 1, 2007, and ending July 1, 2012, multifuel heating stoves used for heating an individual purchaser's residence are exempt from tax. The term “multifuel heating stoves” are stoves that are capable of burning a wide variety of alternative fuels, including, but not limited to, shelled corn, wood pellets, cherry pits, and olive pits. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-609.10(18). Local Utilities Tax Virginia law authorizes its localities to impose a tax on water or heat, light and power companies, detailed below. The local sales and use tax, however, does not apply to utilities other than for non-domestic use because the local sales and use tax applies only to the same base as the state sales and use tax, which does not apply to gas, electricity, or water when delivered to consumers through mains, lines, or pipes. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-605(B); Va. Code Ann. §58.1-609.1(3). Additionally, artificial or propane gas, firewood, coal or home heating oil used for domestic consumption is exempt from the state sales and use tax. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-609.10(1). Water or Heat, Light and Power Companies Tax Virginia authorizes all localities to impose a tax on consumers of utility services provided by any water, heat, light and power, or other utility. A locality may impose a rate of up to 20 percent on the first $15 charged each month to consumers of the utility service. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-3814(A).

Topic: Utilities, Fuel, Mining and Natural Resource Extraction, Production, Sale Mining, Timber, Natural Resource Extraction Oil and Gas Machinery and Equipment

Exempt Machinery and equipment used directly in processing, manufacturing, refining or extracting oil or gas for sale are exempt from sales and use tax. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-609.3(2); Va. Code Ann. §58.1-609.3(12); Va. Regs. §10-210-960. From July 1, 1994, to July 1, 2022, Virginia exempts from sales and use tax raw materials, fuel, power, energy, supplies, machinery, or tools, including repair parts or replacements that are used directly in the drilling, extraction, or processing of natural gas or oil and the reclamation of the well area. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-609.3(12), as amended by 2016 Va. S.B. 563, effective July 1, 2016(extending the period to July 2022 from July 2016); Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 16-185 (Sept. 16, 2016) (a taxpayer claiming that certain equipment purchased was exempt because it was used in the taxpayer's business in the natural gas industry was held liable for the sales tax on that equipment because the taxpayer failed to provide evidence that the equipment was used for the taxpayer's natural gas business). The term “natural gas” has the same meaning as “gas,” “natural gas,” and “coalbed methane gas” as they are defined in Va. Code Ann. §45.1-361.1. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-609.3(12). Under that section the terms “gas”and “natural gas” mean all natural gas whether hydrocarbon or nonhydrocarbon or any combination or mixture thereof, including hydrocarbons, hydrogen sulfide, helium, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen, casing head gas, and all other fluids not defined as oil under Va. Code Ann. §45.1-361.1. Va. Code Ann. §45.1-361.1. The term “coalbed methane gas”means occluded natural gas produced from coalbeds and associated rock strata. Va. Code Ann. §45.1-361.1. The terms “drilling,” “extraction,”and “processing” include production, inspection, testing, dewatering, dehydration, or distillation of raw natural gas into a usable condition consistent with commercial practices, and the gathering and transportation of raw natural gas to a facility where the gas is converted into such a usable condition. Machinery, tools and equipment, including repair parts or replacements, are exempt from tax if the preponderance of their use is directly in the drilling, extraction, refining, or processing of natural gas or oil for sale or resale, or in well area reclamation activities required by state or federal law. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-609.3(12). BNA-SUTN VA 30.3.2.1.

Exempt Machinery or tools, including repair parts or replacements, fuel, power, energy, or supplies that are used directly in the harvesting of forest products for sale or for use as a component part of a product to be sold are exempt from tax. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-609.2(6); Va. Regs. §10-210-700(2.1). Effective July 1, 2013, harvesting of forest products includes all operations prior to the transport of the harvested product used for: • removing timber or other forest products from the harvesting site; • complying with environmental protection and safety requirements applicable to the harvesting of forest products; • obtaining access to the harvesting site; and • loading cut timber or other forest products onto highway vehicles for transportation to storage or processing facilities. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-609.2(6), as amended by 2013 Va. H.B. 2054, effective July 1, 2013. A harvester's direct use of machinery and tools, fuel, power, energy, or supplies in the harvesting of the forest products is exempt from tax. In addition, repair or replacement parts used to repair, restore, or refurbish machinery and tools that are directly used in the harvesting of forest products are also exempt from the use tax. Va. Regs. §10-210-700. However, a harvester's use of machinery and tools, fuel, power, energy, or supplies indirectly in the harvesting of forest products or in any other activity is subject to tax. Va. Regs. §10-210-700. Machinery and tools used in clearing land or constructing roads to open up a logging site, clearing trash from the harvesting site, or transporting severed product from the harvesting site are not exempt from tax because such items are not considered to be used directly in harvesting forest products. Va. Regs. §10-210-700(2.3). A harvester may purchase the following items exempt from tax if they are used directly in harvesting activities:• axes; • bulldozers(crawler tractors with a rear mounted winch with cables), if used to pull logs out of the woods; • cables, if used to pull logs out of the woods; • chain saws; • fork lifts or lift trucks used to move logs at a harvesting site; • hydraulic slashers; • log carts; • oil, if used in tractors or other log handling equipment; • repair parts for machinery and tools used directly in the harvesting of forest products; • saw blades; • saws; • shearers; • skidders; • tires, if used on bulldozers or tractors to pull logs out of the woods; • tractors;and • wedges. Va. Regs. §10-210-700(2.4). The following items are subject to the tax even when used by a harvester of forest products:• bulldozers(crawler tractors with a front mounted blade) when used to open roads into woods for trucks or to clear mill site of trash; • cables used to secure logs to a truck for transportation; • fuel tanks; • grading machines; • gravel, culverts, and similar items used in opening and constructing roads; • oil, if used in trucks that transport the logs from forest to mill or in equipment used to open roads or remove trash; • repair parts for licensed and unlicensed trucks; • repair tools; • tires, if used on vehicles for transporting lumber to mill site; • trucks(other than licensed vehicles); and • welders, and related gases. Va. Regs. §10-210-700(2.5). A harvester's use of supplies or equipment in both an exempt activity and a taxable activity will result in those items being subject to the tax unless the harvester can accurately determine the percentage of use of the items or equipment in the harvesting of forest products as compared to the use of the supplies or equipment in a taxable activity. If an accurate percentage can be determined then the harvester can prorate the tax due on the supplies or equipment based upon the percentage of use of the items in a taxable activity. Va. Regs. §10-210-700(2.6). BNA-SUTN VA 30.3.3.
