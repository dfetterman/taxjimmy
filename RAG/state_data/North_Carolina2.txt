Topic: Administration and Procedure Agencies Responsible for Administration State Sales and Use Tax

North Carolina Department of Revenue The North Carolina Secretary of Revenue is responsible for interpreting all laws it administers in a manner that is consistent with the applicable rules. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-264(a). An interpretation by the Secretary is prima facie correct. When the Secretary interprets a law by adopting a rule or publishing a bulletin or directive on the law, the interpretation is a protection to the officers and taxpayers affected by the interpretation, and the taxpayers are entitled to rely upon the interpretation. The Secretary is not prevented from changing an interpretation, and the change made by the Secretary is applied on and after the effective date of the change. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-264(c). If the Secretary changes an interpretation, a taxpayer who relied on an interpretation before it was changed is not liable for any penalty or additional assessment on any tax that accrued before the interpretation was changed when the reason tax was not paid was reliance on the interpretation. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-264(a). In addition, if a taxpayer requests specific advice from the North Carolina Department of Revenue and receive erroneous advice in response; the taxpayer is not liable for any penalty or additional assessment attributable to the erroneous advice furnished by the North Carolina Department of Revenue. However escaping liability also depends on the extent to which the following conditions are satisfied:• the advice was reasonably relied upon by the taxpayer; N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-264(b)(1). • the penalty or additional assessment did not result from the taxpayer's failure to provide adequate or accurate information; N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-264(b)(2). and • the North Carolina Department of Revenue provided the advice in writing or the department's records establish that the department provided erroneous verbal advice. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-264(b)(3). BNA-SUTN NC 31.1.1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Agencies Responsible for Administration Local Sales and Use Tax

North Carolina Department of Revenue The state of North Carolina Secretary of Revenue administers all of the local sales and use taxes imposed by a county. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-469(a). The Secretary will also design, print and furnish to all retailers in a taxing county, the necessary forms for filing returns and instructions to insure full collection from retailers, and the Secretary may adapt the present form used for the reporting and collecting of the state sales and use tax for this purpose. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-471. Under North Carolina law, individuals and businesses that are required to collect and remit sales and use tax must file the appropriate return forms with taxes when they are paid to the North Carolina Department of Revenue. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.16(a). Any retailer that is required to hold a sales tax permit must file a sales tax return. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.7; N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.16(a). The returns must be signed by the person filing the return, or by that person's authorized agent, when the tax returns are filed. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.16(a). The procedures for filing local sales and use tax returns are the same as the procedures for filing state sales and use tax returns in North Carolina. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.16. Under North Carolina law, individuals and businesses that purchase and consume nonexempt tangible personal property without otherwise paying sales tax to a retailer that is required to collect the tax must file use tax returns. An individual who is not required to hold a sales tax permit and who makes purchases for personal use may file a use tax return on an annual basis. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.16(d). The local sales and use taxes are subject to the same statute of limitations as imposed on the state sales and use taxes in North Carolina. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-241.8(b)(2)(a); N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-241.8(b)(2)(b); N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-241.8(b)(2)(c); N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-474. The state of North Carolina general statute of limitations for proposing an assessment is the later of three years after the due date of the return, or three years after the taxpayer filed the return. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-241.8(a)(1); N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-241.8(a)(2). There is no statute of limitations and the Secretary may propose an assessment of tax due from a taxpayer at any time if any of the following applies: the taxpayer did not file a return; the taxpayer filed a fraudulent return; or the taxpayer attempted in any manner to fraudulently evade or defeat the tax. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-241.8(b)(2)(a); N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-241.8(b)(2)(b); N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-241.8(b)(2)(c). The North Carolina Voluntary Disclosure Program is designed and has been implemented to promote compliance with tax laws and to benefit taxpayers who discover a past filing obligation and liability that have not been paid or otherwise discharged. The voluntary disclosure program applies to taxpayers that have failed to file returns and pay any taxes due to the state of North Carolina Department of Revenue, and it applies to any tax administered by the Department.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Vendor/Seller Registration

Required Before a person may engage in business as a retailer or a wholesale merchant, or when a facilitator is liable for sales or use tax, the person must obtain a Certificate of Registration. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.29(a), as amended by 2017 N.C. H.B. 59, §8 effective Sept. 30, 2017. To obtain a Certificate of Registration, a person must register with the Department. A wholesale merchant, retailer, or facilitator who has more than one business is required to obtain only one Certificate of Registration to cover all operations of the business throughout the state. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.29(a), as amended by 2017 N.C. H.B. 59, §8 effective Sept. 30, 2017. An application for registration must be signed as follows:• by the owner, if the owner is an individual; N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.29(a)(1). • by a manager, member, or partner, if the owner is an association, partnership, or a limited liability company; N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.29(a)(2). and • by an executive officer or some other person specifically authorized by the corporation to sign the application, if the owner is a corporation. If the application is signed by a person authorized to do so by the corporation, written evidence of the person's authority must be attached to the application. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.29(a)(3). A Certificate of Registration is not assignable and is valid only for the person in whose name it is issued. A copy of the Certificate of Registration must be displayed at each place of business. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.29(b). A certificate of registration is valid unless it is revoked or becomes void. The certificate becomes void if, for a period of 18 months, a seller or facilitator files no returns or files returns showing no sales. A certificate of registration issued to a seller who, under the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, is a model one seller and contracts with a certified service provider(CSP) does not become void if the CSP files returns for such seller showing no sales for a period for which the certificate could otherwise become void. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.29(a), as amended by 2017 N.C. H.B. 59, §8 effective Sept. 30, 2017. The failure of a wholesale merchant or retailer to comply with these requirements is grounds for revocation of the wholesale merchant's or retailer's Certificate of Registration. Before the Secretary may revoke a Certificate of Registration, the Secretary must notify the wholesale merchant or retailer that the Secretary proposes to revoke the Certificate of Registration and that the proposed revocation will become final unless the Certificate holder objects to the proposed revocation and files a request for Departmental review within the time provided under N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-241.11 for requesting a Departmental review of a proposed assessment. The notice must be sent in accordance with the methods authorized in N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-241.20. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.29(d). State Government Exemption Process To be eligible for the exemption provided in N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.13(52), a State agency must obtain from the Department a sales tax exemption number. The application for exemption must be in the form required by the Secretary, be signed by the State agency's head, and contain any information required by the Secretary. The Secretary must assign a sales tax exemption number to a State agency that submits a proper application. This section does not apply to an occupational licensing board or to a governmental entity.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Tax Collection and Remittance

Vendor Each responsible person in a business entity is personally and individually liable for sales and use tax. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-242.2(b). If a business entity does not pay a tax it owes after the tax became collectible, the Secretary may enforce the responsible person's liability for the tax by sending the responsible person a notice of proposed assessment. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-242.2(b); North Carolina Important Notice: Annual Requirements for a Conditional Farmer Exemption Certificate Number Holder (Mar. 20, 2015). The sales and use tax for which a person may be held personally and individually liable are all sales and use taxes due upon taxable transactions of the business entity but upon which it failed to collect the tax, but only if the person knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, that the tax was not being collected. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-242.2(b)(2). The North Carolina Tax Board held in In re Pearman, that the president of a corporation was personally liable for the sales and use tax that was owed to North Carolina before the corporation ceased doing business. The corporation filed sales and use tax returns that reported sales tax due, but did not send payment with the return. The taxpayer did not provide evidence that the sales tax was not collected on the corporation's taxable transactions and that the taxpayer did not know that tax was not being collected on the transactions and therefore the taxpayer was personally and individually liable for the unpaid sales tax. In re Richard M. Pearman Jr. President of Dependable Housing Inc., Administrative Decision No. 396, (Dec. 19, 2002). The North Carolina Court of Appeals has also considered a situation in which actions by the Department of Revenue contribute to a taxpayer's late payment. A taxpayer who was a president of a company that was unable to pay sales and use taxes that had been collected was personally liable for the amount due, even though the Department was in part responsible for the company's inability to pay. The company's check for payment of the tax was dishonored because its bank was being investigated by the federal government. The Department was aware of the situation, but failed to immediately assess the company for the unpaid taxes or advise it of the problem involving the bank. The president contended that he was not personally liable because the checks could have been collected if they had been processed in a timely fashion, or collection would have been made from the company if it had been immediately assessed. The Court found that assessment of the tax was valid because the power to collect tax from responsible officers did not depend on the Department's own due diligence. In re Jonas, 70 N.C. App. 116 (1984). Distribution An officer, partner, trustee, or receiver of a business entity required to file a report with the Secretary, who has custody of funds of the entity and who allows the funds to be paid out or distributed to the owners of the entity without having remitted to the Secretary any taxes that are due, is personally liable for the payment of tax. The Secretary may enforce an individual's liability by sending the individual a notice of proposed assessment. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-242.2(d). Statute of Limitations The period of limitations for assessing a responsible person for unpaid taxes expires one year after the expiration of the period of limitations for assessing the business entity or one year after a tax becomes collectible from the business entity. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-242.2(e). Assessments may be made at any time when no license application was ever filed; when no return was ever filed;or when there has been a fraudulent application, return, or attempt to evade tax. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-241.8(b)(2). The taxpayer may sign a written waiver extending the period of limitations. N.C. Admin. Code tit. 17, r. 7B.0300. BNA-SUTN NC 31.3.1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Reliance on SST Matrix

Relieves Liability A person who relies on information provided in the taxability matrix developed by the Secretary of Revenue is not liable for underpayments of tax attributable to erroneous information provided in the taxability matrix until 10 business days after the date of notification by the Secretary. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.42L(b);Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, User Guide: Online Taxability Matrix and Certificate of Compliance (Nov. 20, 2018). Retailers are not liable for underpayment of tax attributable to a rate change where the State fails to provide at least 30 days between the enactment of the new rate change and its effective date, provided there is no showing that a retailer fraudulently failed to collect tax at the new rate or that a retailer solicited customers based on the immediately preceding effective rate. Retailers are entitled to liability relief only if:• the retailer collected tax at the immediately preceding rate; and • the retailer's failure to collect at the newly effective rate does not extend beyond 30 days after the date of enactment of the new rate or the effective date applicable under N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.15A. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.42L(b). BNA-SUTN NC 31.3.4.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Certified Service Providers

Relieves Liability North Carolina relieves sellers of sales and use tax liability when they contract with certified service providers for the collection and remittance of sales and use tax. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.42I(c). North Carolina considers certified service providers to be the agents of the sellers with which they contract and as such are liable for any sales and use tax due on the sales transactions processed by the certified service provider. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.42I(c). However, the certified service provider is relieved of sales and use tax liability if the seller misrepresents the type of products it sells or the seller does not commit fraud. In the event of such misrepresentation or fraud, the seller is liable for taxes not collected as a result of the misrepresentation or fraud. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.42I(c). North Carolina relieves certified service providers, and any seller registered under the Agreement that contracts with a certified service provider, from tax liability to North Carolina and its local jurisdictions for 10 days after notification by the State to conform with changes to the taxability matrix. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.42L(b), as amended by 2016 N.C. S.B. 729, §3.17(a), effective Sept. 1, 2016; Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Taxability Matrix, North Carolina (version 2018.0).

Every 12 months after requiring a taxpayer to pay a tax by EFT the Secretary must determine whether, during the applicable period, the average amount of the taxpayer's required payments of the tax was at least $20,000 a month. If it was not, the Secretary must suspend the requirement that the taxpayer pay the tax by EFT and notify the taxpayer in writing that the requirement has been suspended. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-241(b)(3). Payment by electronic funds transfer also is required for a taxpayer required to prepay its sales and use tax liability under N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.16. N.C. Gen.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Multistate Certificates Other

Accepted There are two types of farmer exemptions in North Carolina, qualifying and conditional, each of which has its own certificate. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.13E. A qualifying farmer is a person who has an annual gross income of $10,000 or more from farming operations for either the preceding tax year or who has an average annual gross income for the three preceding taxable years of $10,000 or more from farming operations. The exemption certificate provided to a qualifying farmer expires when the person fails to meet the income threshold for three consecutive taxable years or ceases to engage in farming operations. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.13E(a). A conditional farmer is a person who does not meet the definition of a qualifying farmer and may apply to the Department for a conditional exemption certificate. A person with a conditional exemption is allowed to purchase items exempt from sales and use tax to the same extent as a qualifying farmer. The exemption certificate issued by the department for a conditional farmer is valid for the income tax year in which the certificate is issued, and the following two income tax years, provided farming operations continue. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.13E(b); North Carolina Important Notice: Annual Requirements for a Conditional Farmer Exemption Certificate Number Holder (March 20, 2015). A person who is issued a conditional farmer exemption certificate is required to submit copies of income tax returns to the department with 90 days following the end of the year covered by the exemption certificate. If returns are not submitted, the certificate will be cancelled, and sales and use taxes become due and payable with interest accruing from the original date of purchases. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.13E(b); North Carolina Important Notice: Annual Requirements for a Conditional Farmer Exemption Certificate Number Holder (March 20, 2015). Failure to provide returns in a timely manner will result in liability for taxes at the general sales and use tax rate on purchases where an exemption is claimed, and a $250 penalty will be applied to sellers who accept the cancelled certificate. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.13E(b); North Carolina Important Notice: Annual Requirements for a Conditional Farmer Exemption Certificate Number Holder (March 20, 2015). Effective July 1, 2017, a conditional exemption certificate may not be extended or renewed beyond the original three-year period; however, a person may request a one-year extension for their conditional exemption certificate if the person satisfies all of the following:• The person holds a conditional exemption certificate that is scheduled to expire within 30 days of an extension request • The person suffers a weather-related disaster that prevents the person from becoming eligible for a qualifying exemption certificate • The person provides the Department with all of the following: • Documents demonstrating that, but for the disaster, the person would have earned $10,000 or more in gross sales for the year in which the disaster occurred; • Documentation of revenues and expenses relating to the damaged crop; and • An affidavit from a county extension director or FSA county committee that the disaster occurred in the area of the county where the person farms. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.13E(b). Effective until July 1, 2017, a conditional exemption certificate may not be extended or renewed beyond the original three-year period.

N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.27A(a). A person who purchases an item under a direct pay permit is liable for the use tax due on the purchase. The tax is payable when the property is placed in use or the service is received. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.27A(a).

Topic: Administration and Procedure Record-Keeping Requirements

No Specific Time Period Retailers, wholesale merchants, and consumers must keep records that establish their tax liability. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.22. The Secretary or a person designated by the Secretary may inspect these books, records, and documentation kept for purposes of determining compliance with North Carolina tax law at any reasonable time during the day. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.22 as amended by 2016 N.C. S.B. 729, §3.15, effective Jan. 1, 2017. Before enacting 2016 N.C. S.B. 729, the statute referred to this provision as a three-year time period. However, North Carolina removed the phrase “for a period of three years.” As the bill summary to 2016 N.C. S.B. 729 explains, it was misleading to think of the record-keeping requirement as a three-year period. Instead, records should be retained for periods covered within a statute of limitations. The statute of limitations is generally three years, but an ongoing audit might exceed three years, and there is no statute of limitations if a taxpayer fails to file a return. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.22 as amended by 2016 N.C. S.B. 729, §3.15, effective Jan. 1, 2017. Retail Merchant Records A retailer's records and documentation must include records of the retailer's gross income, gross sales, net taxable sales, and all items purchased for resale. Where there is a failure of a retailer to keep records and documentation that establish that a sale is exempt from tax as required, the retailer is subject to liability for tax on the sale. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.22. Wholesale Merchant Records A wholesale merchant's records must include a bill of sale for each customer containing the name and address of the purchaser, the date of the purchase, the item purchased, and the price at which the wholesale merchant sold the item. Where there is a failure of a wholesale merchant to keep these records and documentation corresponding to the sale of an item as required, the wholesale merchant is subject to liability for tax at the rate that applies to the retail sale of the item. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.22. Consumer Records A consumer's records must include an invoice or other statement of the purchase price of an item the consumer purchased from outside North Carolina. Where there is a failure of the consumer to keep these records as required, the consumer is subject to liability for tax on the purchase price of the item, as determined by the Secretary. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.22. BNA-SUTN NC 31.9.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Refunds

Both A taxpayer who remits sales or use tax directly to the Department in excess of the rate or amount of state and/or county tax due on the sale or purchase of tangible personal property or other taxable transactions is entitled to a refund of the overpayment or erroneous payment of tax. North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Bulletin Section 34-21.A. When taxes are paid to a vendor in error, a customer/vendee must request a refund or credit from the vendor who in turn may obtain a refund or credit from the Department. The vendor must issue a refund or credit to the customer/vendee and provide documentation to the Department before receiving a refund or credit from the Department of Revenue. A taxpayer who requests a refund or credit from a vendor should retain copies of the request and make the document available for review by the Department. North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Bulletin Section 34-21.A. A claim for refund should be submitted in duplicate on Form E-588, Business Claim for Refund State and County Sales and Use Taxes. The refund will be verified by departmental personnel in Raleigh or referred to the appropriate field office of the Examination Division. After a claim is verified or approved, a refund voucher is issued and forwarded to the taxpayer. North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Bulletin Section 34-21.B. When submitting a claim for excessive or erroneous collection of tax, supporting data to be submitted includes copies of invoices or schedules reflecting the purchaser's name, invoice numbers, a description of the property purchased, the amount of tax collected, and copies of refund checks or credit memos that were issued to the purchaser. If applicable, copies of executed exemption certificates should also be submitted. North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Bulletin Section 34-21.C. North Carolina law provides for a refund when a taxpayer has made an overpayment of taxes, provided that a request for refund is made within three years after the date set by statute for filing of the return or within two years from the date of payment of the tax, whichever is later. North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Bulletin Section 34-21.F. If the refund claim is denied, a taxpayer may request that the Department review that action by submitting Form NC-242, Objection and Request for Departmental Review, to the Department of Revenue. The request for review must be filed with the Department within 45 days from the date the notice was mailed by the Department(if mailed) or delivered to the taxpayer (if delivered by a Department employee in person). N.C. Dept. of Rev. Resolving Disputes About Your Taxes. Certain joint intergovernmental agencies created to provide fire or police protection, or emergency services are allowed a refund for sales and use tax paid on direct purchases of tangible personal property and services. To request a refund, qualifying agencies must file Form E-585, Nonprofit and Governmental Entity Claim for Refund State, County, and Transit Sales and Use Taxes, annually within six months of the end of the agency's fiscal year. North Carolina Important Notice: Certain Joint Agencies Created to Provide Fire Protection, Emergency Services, or Police Protection (Sept. 21, 2015). Beginning July 1, 2018, a retailer who pays sales and use tax on property or services and subsequently resells the property or services at retail, without the property or service being used by the retailer, may recover the sales or use tax originally paid to a seller. A retailer entitled to recover tax may reduce taxable receipts by the taxable amount of the purchase price of the property or services resold for the period in which the retail sale occurs. A recovery of tax is not an overpayment of tax and, where such recovery is taken, a refund of the tax originally paid should not be requested. Any amount for tax recovered in excess of tax due for a reporting period is not subject to refund. Any tax recovered may be carried forward to a subsequent reporting period and taken as an adjustment to taxable receipts. The records of the retailer must clearly reflect and support the adjustment to taxable receipts for the period in which the adjustment is made. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.11B, as added by 2018 N.C. S. 99, effective July 1, 2018; N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.11(b), as amended by 2018 N.C. S. 99, effective July 1, 2018. The records of a retailer who reduces taxable receipts pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.11B must clearly reflect and support the adjustment to taxable receipts for the period in which the adjustment is made. The retailer's records must include the sales invoice or similar billing document given to its customer at the time of the sale or other such records that identifies the items sold. Additionally, the retailer must maintain in its records the corresponding purchase invoice or other statement reflecting the purchase price and North Carolina sales or use tax paid on the items resold. Failure of a retailer to keep records that establish a retailer qualifies for a recovery of sales and use tax originally paid to a seller disqualifies the retailer from recovering the sales and use tax originally paid. A retailer is liable for any additional tax, applicable penalties, and applicable interest for any adjustments made to taxable receipts that are not substantiated by adequate books and records.

Failure to Obtain a License For failure to obtain a license before engaging in a business, trade or profession for which a license is required, the Secretary is required to assess a penalty equal to 5 percent of the amount prescribed for the license per month, or fraction of that amount until paid, not to exceed 25 percent of the amount so prescribed, but in any event not less than $5. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-236(a)(2). Failure to File a Return In the case of a failure to file any return on the date it is due, determined with regard to any extension of time for filing, the Secretary is required to assess a penalty equal to 5 percent of the amount of the tax if the failure is for not more than one month, with an additional 5 percent for each additional month, or fraction of a month, during which the failure continues, but not exceeding 25 percent in the aggregate, or $5, whichever is greater. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-236(a)(3).

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Waiver of Penalties

Yes The Secretary of Revenue may, upon making a record of the reasons for doing so, waive any civil penalties imposed against a taxpayer. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-237(a). The North Carolina Department of Revenue issued a Penalty Waiver Policy, which applies to requests for a waiver of civil penalties considered by the Department on or after July 1, 2009, and does not apply to any compliance program or initiative that includes terms for the full or partial waiver of penalties for participants. A category of general waiver criteria, which consists of three automatic reasons to waive a penalty and one conditional reason of a good compliance record, and a category of special circumstances, are the basis for waiving a civil penalty under this policy. However, as a specific exception to the permitted waiver of penalty, a penalty imposed for failure to pay trust taxes that are withheld or collected and not remitted, such as sales taxes, are not eligible for a waiver of penalty. North Carolina Dept. of Rev., Penalty Waiver Policy. Automatic reasons for waiver of a penalty include the death of the taxpayer, the taxpayers immediate family member, or the taxpayer's tax preparer; serious, sudden illness of the taxpayer, the taxpayer's immediate family member, or the taxpayer's tax preparer;and a natural disaster, such as a tornado or hurricane, or an accident, such as a fire, that destroyed property, records, or both. North Carolina Dept. of Rev., Penalty Waiver Policy. Editor's Note: The department may waive penalties for taxpayers affected by a disaster.

Yes North Carolina held an amnesty program that began on April 23, 2010 and ended on June 30, 2010. North Carolina Dept. of Rev., Internet Transactions Resolution Program. The amnesty program is known as the Internet Transaction Resolution Program, and it arose as a result of a collaboration of the Department of Revenue with e-commerce retailers that had operated affiliate programs in the state, as an effort to resolve issues of tax liability and promote equal treatment of all businesses in the state. Any retailer that failed to register for sales and use tax as a result of operating an affiliate program in North Carolina was eligible to participate in the program and must have submitted an election to participate in the program by June 30, 2010. A resolution agreement must be signed by both the retailer and the Department by Aug. 31, 2010. North Carolina Dept. of Rev., Internet Transactions Resolution Program. Participants in this program could have resolved their prior tax liability by registering for sales and use tax and agreeing to collect and remit those taxes for four years, beginning as of Sept. 1, 2010. The Department of Revenue agreed not to assess any tax, penalties, or interest for periods prior to Sept. 1, 2010 for retailers that successfully completed the program and also agreed not to exercise its authority to obtain consumer information from the retailer to collect a tax liability for the period prior to Sept. 1, 2010. North Carolina Dept. of Rev., Internet Transactions Resolution Program. With respect to retailers that failed to participate in the program and were subject to nexus filing requirements, the Department assessed all applicable tax, penalties, and interest.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Voluntary Disclosure Relief

Yes The North Carolina Voluntary Disclosure Program is intended to promote compliance with tax laws and to benefit taxpayers who discover a past filing obligation and liability that have not been paid or otherwise discharged. North Carolina Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program. Voluntary disclosure arises when a taxpayer contacts the Department without any prior initial contact by the Department concerning the filing of a return and the payment of a tax, and includes requests by taxpayers under the Multistate Tax Commission National Nexus Program. A major component of the Voluntary Disclosure Program is to resolve sales and use tax liabilities when nexus is the central issue. The Voluntary Disclosure Program applies to taxpayers that have failed to file returns and pay any taxes due to the Department, to any tax administered by the Department of Revenue, and to any type of domestic or foreign taxpayer that is subject to tax in North Carolina. North Carolina Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program. Specific Taxpayers Disqualified From Participation The Voluntary Disclosure Program is not available to corporate and individual income taxpayers who have engaged in income shifting tax strategies or other tax shelter activities that minimize or eliminate North Carolina state taxes. Voluntary disclosure does not apply to a taxpayer that is registered for payment of a tax but fails to file a return, nor does it apply to a taxpayer that files a return but underreports the tax due on the return. This program is also not available to corporations and limited liability companies having their articles of incorporation or certificate of authority suspended by the Secretary of State for failure to file any report or return or to pay any tax for 90 days after it is due, and those corporations or limited liability companies subject to reinstatement following such a suspension. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-230(a); N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-232(a). Qualification for Voluntary Disclosure In order for a disclosure made by a taxpayer to be considered voluntary, the disclosure must meet the following criteria: North Carolina Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program. • the Department of Revenue has not already contacted the taxpayer with respect to any tax for which the taxpayer is requesting voluntary disclosure; • the taxpayer does not have outstanding liabilities for other taxes; • the taxpayer is not under audit for any tax; • the taxpayer was never previously registered for the tax schedule being disclosed; • the taxpayer has never filed a return with the Department for the tax schedule being disclosed; • the taxpayer pays the tax due plus accrued interest (Upon request, the Department will calculate the interest due and notify the taxpayer.); • upon request, the taxpayer makes records available for audit to verify the amount of the taxpayer's liability and the accuracy of the representations made by the taxpayer; and • subsequent to the disclosure, the taxpayer remains in compliance for all tax schedules. Application for Participation in Voluntary Disclosure Program A taxpayer must furnish information in writing to the Department of Revenue in order to make a satisfactory application to participate in the Voluntary Disclosure Program. Specifically, the taxpayer or a representative of the taxpayer must initiate contact with the Department of Revenue by writing a letter describing all of the following: • the taxpayer's business; • the nature and extent of the taxpayer's activities in North Carolina, including whether the taxpayer does any of the following: o owns or leases property in North Carolina, o has employees or independent sales representatives soliciting sales in North Carolina, o has inventory located in North Carolina, o makes deliveries into North Carolina and, if so, the means of transportation used, o engages third parties to install or repair property sold to North Carolina customers, or o engages in other activities described in N.C. Admin. Code tit. 17, r. 05C.0102 or in N.C. Gen. Stat. §§105-164.3(5) or 105-164.8(b); • the length of time the taxpayer has been in business and the period of time it conducted activities in North Carolina; • the taxpayer's previous filing or payment history with the Department; • whether the taxpayer has been contacted by the North Carolina Department of Revenue or the Multistate Tax Commission regarding its liability; • whether the taxpayer has any outstanding liabilities for any tax administered by the Department; and • an explanation of why returns were not filed and taxes paid. North Carolina Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program. The application in request to qualify for a voluntary disclosure must be made in writing and addressed to the following: North Carolina Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program. Voluntary Disclosure Program N.C. Dept. of Rev. P. O. Box 871 Raleigh, North Carolina 27602-0871 Review and Approval of Voluntary Disclosure Requests An application will not be considered for voluntary disclosure until a full written disclosure has been submitted to the North Carolina Department of Revenue. Based on the information submitted, the application will be approved, rejected, or a counter proposal made. Once the application has been approved, unless a letter is more appropriate, the Department will sign a Voluntary Disclosure Agreement and send it to the taxpayer or representative of the taxpayer to obtain proper signatures. North Carolina Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program. Upon receipt of a properly signed Voluntary Disclosure Agreement, the Department will determine whether the taxpayer has an outstanding liability for any tax, a prior filing history, or previous contact with the Department. Any returns and payments made by the taxpayer or taxpayer's representative and received by the Department will be processed and an account will be established for the funds. North Carolina Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program. If the Department determines that the taxpayer or its representative misrepresented the information furnished to the Department upon which the agreement is based, the agreement can be voided and the Department can then take action as if the agreement does not exist. North Carolina Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program. The Department also reserves its right to audit a taxpayer's books and records, and make an assessment subject to the applicable time limits. The audit may include all or part of a voluntary disclosure period. The Department will assess any tax determined to be due that was not discharged under the Voluntary Disclosure Agreement. All applicable penalties and interest will apply to additional taxes discovered to be due that have not been paid. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-241.8(a); N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-241.8(b)(2);North Carolina Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program. Benefits of Voluntary Disclosure A taxpayer who has made qualified voluntary disclosures and whose application for a voluntary disclosure is approved will have the following benefits: • Waiver of civil penalties and an agreement by the Department to not pursue criminal prosecution, unless the taxpayer collected a trust tax but did not pay it to the Department. If trust taxes were collected, the Department will waive all civil penalties except the 10 percent civil penalty for failure to pay the tax when due. In the absence of fraud, the Department will not pursue criminal prosecution. • When applicable, the ability to file the liability in a spreadsheet format versus filing a return for each period involved. The spreadsheets must reflect liability in chronological order. • When applicable, the ability to file the liability in a spreadsheet format versus filing a return for each period involved. The spreadsheets must reflect liability in chronological order. • Sixty days to determine the liability and prepare the returns or spreadsheets. • A requirement to pay all tax due for only the look-back period. North Carolina Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program. The look-back period is four delinquent years for annual filers or forty-eight months for taxes that do not have an annual filing frequency. If the applicant has collected taxes and not reported them for periods beyond the look-back period, the look-back period will be extended to cover those periods. The look-back period for voluntary disclosure is shorter than the look-back period that applies when the Department discovers through examination that a taxpayer has failed to file returns and pay taxes due. The look-back period for taxpayers discovered through examination is six years for annual filers or seventy-two months for taxes that do not have an annual filing frequency. North Carolina Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program. Trust Tax Recovery Program The Trust Tax Recovery Program allows businesses to pay unpaid or non-filed trust taxes to the Department of Revenue in installments based on predetermined installment terms. Upon full payment of the tax and applicable interest, all penalties and collection assistance fees assessed are waived. North Carolina Dept. of Rev., Frequently Asked Questions - Trust Tax Recovery Program. Generally, sales and use taxes are considered trust taxes, which are taxes paid by a customer to a seller or withheld from an employee and held in trust by the business until they are filed and paid to the Department of Revenue. However, a purchaser's use tax liability due on purchases of tangible personal property, certain digital property, or certain taxable services on which sale and use taxes were not paid at the time of purchase, does not constitute a trust tax. North Carolina Dept. of Rev., Frequently Asked Questions - Trust Tax Recovery Program. Businesses may qualify for the Trust Tax Recovery Program if they:• have an outstanding balance of trust taxes due; • have not defaulted or had a penalty waiver on the Trust Tax Recovery Program, the Small Business Counseling Program, or the Small Business Taxpayer Recovery Program; and • are not facing criminal charges and are not the subject of a criminal investigation by the Department of Revenue.

To participate in the MVDP, the taxpayer must:• have a minimum good-faith tax liability estimate of $500 or more; • not have been contacted by a state or commission regarding taxes due;and • submit a completed Voluntary Disclosure Agreement (VDA) including taxpayer's contact information, tax year, list of states to receive the proposed VDA, description of taxpayer's activities in each state, and estimate of taxes due. Multistate Tax Commission, Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program. North Carolina may have additional requirements for participation in the MVDP. The program is intended to incentivize taxpayers to begin filing and paying taxes in all of the states in which they have substantial nexus. Upon entering into a voluntary disclosure agreement with a state, taxpayers will be required to file returns, pay the tax due and accrued interest on the returns, and register with the state in exchange for waiver of penalties for the entire look-back period. Taxpayers are not charged to participate in the MVDP. Online Marketplace Seller Voluntary Disclosure Initiative – Special Multistate Tax Commission (MTC)Program From Aug. 17, 2017, through Nov. 1, 2017, North Carolina is participating in the MTC's special limited-time voluntary disclosure initiative in which back sales and use tax liability may be waived for eligible online marketplace sellers that timely register and begin to collect the state's sales and use tax. North Carolina Dept. of Rev., NCDOR Participating in Online Marketplace Seller Voluntary Disclosure Initiative. North Carolina is considering applications from all marketplace sellers, including those that have been contacted by the Department of Revenue regarding their liability for sales and use, income, and franchise taxes. For marketplace sellers that qualify, the state will not assert liability for past taxes. However, where sales and use taxes (or withholding taxes) have been collected but not remitted, a 10 percent failure to pay penalty applies. North Carolina Dept. of Rev., NCDOR Participating in Online Marketplace Seller Voluntary Disclosure Initiative.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Audits

Authorized The Secretary and any duly authorized agent are authorized and empowered to examine the books, papers, records, documents, or other data of all retailers or wholesale merchants. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.30. This power has been conferred for the purpose of enforcing the collection of North Carolina's sales and use tax. The department may specifically assess the correctness of any return or make a return for a retailer or wholesale merchant that has failed to make one when required. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.30. Authorization to Assess Tax Based Upon Estimate If a retailer, a wholesale merchant, or a consumer fails to file a return and pay the tax due or files a grossly incorrect or false or fraudulent return, the Secretary must estimate the tax due and assess the retailer, wholesale merchant, or consumer based on the estimate. Beginning July 1, 2018, if a “facilitator”fails to file a return and pay the tax due or files a grossly incorrect or false or fraudulent return, the Secretary must estimate the tax due and assess the retailer, wholesale merchant, or consumer based on the estimate. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.32, as amended by 2018 N.C. S. 99, effective July 1, 2018. The general statute of limitations for proposing an assessment is the later of the following:• three years after the due date of the return; N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-241.8(a)(1). or • three years after the taxpayer filed the return. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-241.8(a)(2). Scope of Investigation The examination of books, papers, records, documents, and other data may be performed by the Secretary or his duly authorized agent at all reasonable hours during the day. Additionally, the Secretary or his duly authorized agent may require the attendance of any person and take his testimony with respect to any matter for determining the correctness of a return, or for the purpose of making a return where none has been made as required, with power to administer oaths to a person or persons summoned as a witness. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.30. Effect of Failure to Comply With Examination In the event any retailer or wholesale merchant fails or refuses to permit examination of his books, papers, accounts, records, documents, or other data by the Secretary or his authorized agents, the Secretary has the power to proceed by citing the retailer or wholesale merchant to show cause before the superior court of the county in which the taxpayer resides or has its principal place of business as to why the books, records, papers, documents, or data should not be examined. The superior court has jurisdiction to enter an order requiring the production of all necessary books, records, papers, documents, or data and to punish for contempt of the order any person for violating the request for examination of books, papers, accounts, records, documents, or other relevant data. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.30, as amended by 2016 N.C. S.B. 729, §3.16, effective Sept. 1, 2016. Effect of Failure to Comply With Summons If any person summoned as a witness fails to obey any summons to appear before the Secretary or his authorized agent, or refuses to testify or answer any material question or to produce any book, record, paper, or other data when required to do so, the failure or refusal must be reported to the Attorney General or the district solicitor, who must then institute proceedings in the superior court of the county where the witness resides to compel obedience to any summons of the Secretary or his authorized agent. Officers who serve summonses or subpoenas, and witnesses attending, will receive like compensation as officers and witnesses in the superior courts, which is paid from the proper appropriation for the administration of the applicable tax. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.30. Contingency Contracts North Carolina law prevents the Department of Revenue from contracting with private accounting firms to perform an examination of a taxpayer's books and records where the compensation structure of the contract is based on the amount of tax ultimately collected from the disputed taxpayer. However, the Department of Revenue may contract with outside accounting firms to perform audit services or collection services where the private examining firm has no authority to determine the amount of tax, interest, court costs, or other penalties that the disputed taxpayer may owe to the state. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.42I. The prohibition against local governments employing entities paid on a contingency basis to assist a county tax assessor and against local governments employing agents paid on a contingent fee basis to determine a taxpayer's liability was scheduled to expire on July 1, 2015. Effective June 24, 2015, the prohibition became permanent. N.C. Gen. Stat. §153A-146; N.C. Gen. Stat. §160A-206, as amended by N.C. 2015 S.B. 682, effective June 24, 2015. BNA-SUTN NC 31.16.
