Stat. §297A.99(1);Minnesota House of Reps., Research Dept., Local Sales Taxes in Minnesota, Dec. 12, 2016; see Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 164. A political subdivision of Minnesota has the authority to impose a general local sales tax under the following provisions: Minn. Stat. §297A.99(1)(a); see also Minnesota Basic Sales and Use Tax Manual. • the metropolitan transportation area sales tax provision; Minn. Stat. §297A.992. • the Greater Minnesota transportation sales and use tax provision; Minn. Stat. §297A.993. • if permitted by special law enacted before June 2, 1997; Minn. Stat. §297A.99(1)(b). or • if the political subdivision enacted and imposed the tax before Jan. 1, 1982. Minn. Stat. §297A.99(1). Under Minnesota law, a compensating local use tax applies at the same rate as the local sales tax on the use, storage, distribution or consumption of tangible personal property or taxable services that would be subject to the local sales tax. Minn. Stat. §297A.99(6); Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 164. Before a political subdivision can impose a local sales and use tax, it must be approved by voters at a general election. Minn. Stat. §297A.99(3)(a). The revenue from the tax must be for a specific capital improvement and be designated at least 90 days before the referendum on imposition of the tax is conducted. Minn. Stat. §297A.99(3)(b). After the completion of the capital improvement, the tax terminates and the locality is prohibited from imposing a local sales and use tax for a period of one year. Minn. Stat. §297A.99(3)(c). The local sales and use tax rate among the cities/counties in Minnesota is imposed on the same items and services that are taxable under the state sales and use tax. Minn. Stat. §297A.99; Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 164. The local tax and state sales and use tax are collected by the Minnesota Commissioner of Revenue. Minn. Stat. §297A.99(9)(a). Local governments including cities, towns, counties, instrumentalities, political subdivisions, commissions, special districts, and governmental boards are not required to pay general local sales taxes. No exemption certificate is necessary. However, state sales tax and special local taxes generally apply. Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 164.

Minn. Stat. §297A.992(1); Minn. Stat. §297A.992(2). The sales tax applies to retail sales made within these specific counties. The use tax applies to taxable items used in these counties if the sales tax was not paid. The tax applies to the same items that are taxable under the state sales and use tax law. The tax is used to fund improvements to the transit system including light rail, commuter rail, and bus rapid transit. Minn. Stat. §297A.992(6);Minnesota Dept. of Rev., Transit Improvement Area Sales and Use Tax Ends September 30, 2017 (July 2017); Minnesota Dept. of Rev., Transit Improvement Sales, Use and Vehicle Excise Tax (June 25, 2008).

The tax was used to fund improvements to the transit system, including light rail, commuter rail and bus rapid transit. Additionally, while local sales tax generally does not apply to sales of motor vehicles, the transit improvement tax applied a $20 vehicle excise tax to sales of motor vehicles in lieu of the Metropolitan Transportation Area Sales and Use Tax when the sale occurred in one of the five counties. This excise tax was required to be collected by any person in the business of selling new or used motor vehicles at retail and submitted to the department on their sales and use tax return. Minn. Stat. §297A.992(1); Minn. Stat. §297A.992(2); Minnesota Sales Tax Fact Sheet 164S; Minnesota Notification of Local Sales and Use Tax Ending. For sales occurring on or after Oct. 1, 2017, Anoka, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, and Washington counties will implement their own transit sales and use tax and a $20 vehicle excise tax.

Minn. Stat. §297A.993(1). Special Law Enacted Before May 20, 2008 In 2008 the Minnesota legislature enacted a temporary measure prohibiting local governments from imposing local option sales taxes until May 31, 2010. Between May 20, 2008, and May 31, 2010, local governments could only extend or change special laws enacted before May 20, 2008 pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 297A.99 Subds. 1 and 2. Minn. Stat. §297A.99(1)(a); Minn. Stat. §297A.99(1)(d).

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Use' or 'Storage, Use, or Consumption'

Defined “Use”is defined as the right or power incident to the ownership of any interest in tangible personal property, or services purchased from a retailer other than the sale of that property in the regular course of business. Minn. Stat. §297A.61(6). Use also includes the consumption of printed materials in the creation of nontaxable advertising that is distributed within Minnesota. Minn. Stat. §297A.61(6); Employer Solutions Staffing Group II, LLC v. Minnesota Comr. of Rev., Docket No. 8445R (Minn. Tax Ct. Oct. 22, 2013) (limited liability corporation that purchased goods and services online from an out of state retailer was liable for use tax in Minnesota, as its consumption fell within the definition of use, and the state use tax was deemed constitutional). Morton Buildings v. Commissioner of Revenue The Minnesota Supreme Court has held that use tax applies to materials purchased and processed into building components outside the state and used to construct buildings within Minnesota. In Morton Buildings Inc. v. Commissioner of Revenue, the taxpayer, an Illinois company, sold and erected pre-fabricated buildings for industry and farm use in Minnesota and in other states. Morton Bldgs. Inc. v. Minnesota Comr. of Rev., 488 N.W.2d 254 (Minn. 1992). The taxpayer purchased raw materials outside of the state and made them into building components at factories located outside the state. When a customer ordered a building, the taxpayer withdrew the necessary raw materials from storage and made them into building components. These materials included lumber, nails, cement, staples, insulation and plastic sheeting. The taxpayer sought a refund on all of the use taxes it paid to Minnesota for the cost of the raw materials it used at its factories outside the state to make building components used in Minnesota. The taxpayer argued that the raw materials at issue were not “used, stored or consumed” in Minnesota because the building components made out of the raw materials were new and different items of tangible personal property. In its analysis, the Supreme Court of Minnesota applied the following test to determine if the imposition of use tax on the raw materials at issue was proper:• the item of tangible personal property must be used, stored or consumed in Minnesota; • the item of personal property must be purchased (not manufactured by the user); and • the purchase of the item of personal property must have been for use, storage or consumption in Minnesota. Morton Bldgs. Inc., 488 N.W.2d 254 (Minn. 1992). The Supreme Court held that the manufacturing process that was performed upon the raw materials did not transform the raw materials into something that was not used in Minnesota. As a result, the raw materials were still tangible personal property used in Minnesota as part of the taxpayer's pre-fabricated buildings. Therefore, the raw materials, in their altered form as building materials, are used in Minnesota when made into prefabricated buildings. The Court ultimately held that the taxpayer clearly exercised a right or power over raw material when it constructs the prefabricated buildings and as such, has a taxable use of the materials in Minnesota. Morton Bldgs. Inc. v. Minnesota Comr. of Rev., 488 N.W.2d 254 (Minn. 1992); see also Custom Ag Serv. of Montevideo Inc. v. Minnesota Comr. of Rev., 728 N.W.2d 910 (Minn. 2007). After the decision in this case, the Legislature codified the result in Minn. Stat. §297A.63(2)(a) which states in part that use tax is imposed on a person who manufactures, fabricates or assembles tangible personal property either within or without the state and who uses, stores, distributes or consumes the manufactured, assembled or fabricated tangible personal property in the state. The tax is imposed upon the purchase price of the materials contained in the tangible personal property. Minn. Stat. §297A.63(2)(a). BNA-SUTN MN 1.4.3.
