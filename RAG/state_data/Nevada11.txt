Yes The complementary use tax is levied on the storage, use, or consumption in Nevada of tangible personal property acquired outside of the state. The use tax is inapplicable if Nevada sales tax has been collected. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.185. Use tax is also imposed on property acquired for resale that is instead later consumed by the purchaser. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.190. All gross receipts are presumed taxable unless the person making the sale proves otherwise. Further, any property sold that is to be delivered within Nevada is presumed to be for the storage, use, or other consumption within Nevada. Substantial use outside Nevada prior to delivery within the state can exempt the property from use tax. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.155; Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.225; Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.255. But see Harrah's Operating Co. v. Nevada Dept. of Taxn., 2014 BL 77955, 321 P.3d 850, 130 Nev. Adv. Op. 15 (Nev. 2014) (two airplanes purchased outside the state are not subject to use tax because the planes' first use was entirely outside of Nevada and they were used continuously in interstate commerce for one year). A purchaser may not refuse to pay sales tax by opting to instead pay the use tax. Nevada Tax Notes July 2005. Nevada allows individuals not in business to report and pay use tax liability on a one-time return or by sending a letter and invoice to the Department. It is recommended that individuals who regularly incur use tax liability register for a consumer's use tax certificate, which is available at no cost. Nevada Tax Bulletin SUT 16-0003. Nevada law provides that the Department of Taxation may require the filing of reports by any person or class of persons possessing information relating to sales of tangible personal property, the storage, use, or consumption of which is subject to Nevada use tax. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.745; Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §374.750. Such reports are due as required by the Department and must include purchasers' the names and addresses, the sale price of the property, the date of sale, and any other information required by the Department.

Est. 1955 Nevada originally enacted the state sales and use tax in 1955, at a rate of 2 percent, to ease the financial crisis facing the local public school systems. Tax Foundation, Nevada, Chapter 3, State Sales and Use Tax and Live Entertainment Tax. In 1956, voters adopted a Constitutional referendum to protect this tax. Tax Foundation, Nevada, Chapter 3, State Sales and Use Tax and Live Entertainment Tax. Due to this protection, the rate and base for the state sales tax cannot be changed without a vote of the people via referendum. Nev. Const. art. XIX, §2; Nevada Attorney General Opinion No. 56-228 (Dec. 10, 1956). In 1967, the local school support tax was established at a rate of 1 percent. In 1969, the basic city-county relief tax was established at a rate of 0.5 percent. In 1979, the sales tax on food was eliminated. In 1981, the local school support tax was increased to 1.5 percent and the supplemental city-county relief tax was established at a rate of 1.75 percent. In 1997, counties were authorized to impose a 0.25 percent sales tax for infrastructure. Nevada Legislature, Nevada's Sales Tax: A Review and Analysis.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Use' or 'Storage, Use, or Consumption'

Not Defined For use tax purposes, the term “use” is not explicitly defined within the Nevada Revised Statutes. However, the term “use”was previously defined to include the exercise of any rights or powers incident to the ownership of tangible personal property. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.100(Repealed). The definition of “use”was repealed in Nov. 1986 along with other changes to Nevada tax law because former definition required “ownership” before the use tax applied. The term “storage,” as defined below, is now broad enough to subject any activity that fit within the former definition of “use,” including the mere retention of tangible personal property, to the use tax. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.075. “Storage” means the keeping or retention of tangible personal property in Nevada that was purchased from a retailer for any purpose other than resale in the regular course of business or subsequent use solely outside of Nevada. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.075. Nevada broadly imposes its use tax on the storage, use, or other consumption of tangible personal property in the state. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.185. However, an exclusion from the definition of “storage, use, or other consumption” exists for the keeping, retaining, or exercising of rights or powers over tangible personal property for the purpose of later transporting it outside of Nevada for use solely outside the state. Nev. Rev. Stat. tit. 32, §372.080. Use tax is imposed on property purchased from unregistered Nevada sellers when the property is purchased for use and not for resale. Nevada Tax Notes July 2010.
