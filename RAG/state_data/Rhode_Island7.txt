Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Prepared Food General Rule

Taxable Sales of prepared food are subject to sales and use tax. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18-30(9), as amended by 2015 R.I. H. 5900, effective July 1, 2015; Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Taxability Matrix, Rhode Island (version 2018.0). If prepared food is sold under one of the following conditions, it is tax exempt:• by a seller whose primary NAICS classification is manufacturing in sector 311, except sub-sector 3118 (bakeries); • in an unheated state by weight or volume as a single item; or • bakery items sold without utensils provided by the seller. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18-30(9); Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Taxability Matrix, Rhode Island (version 2018.0). Rhode Island utilizes the threshold test to determine what effect utensils have upon the taxability of food products. The threshold test is used to determine the percentage of a seller's sales considered to be prepared food by the state. R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-4.13, replacing R.I. Regs. SU 09-59, effective July 23, 2018. The first step in the process is to calculate the sales made:• of food sold in a heated state or heated by the seller; • of food items that are a combination of two or more food ingredients by the seller; except: ○ food that is only cut, repackaged or pasteurized by the seller; ○ egg, fish, meat, poultry and foods containing these raw animal ingredients that require cooking by the consumer as recommended by the U.S.D.A.; ○ food sold in an unheated state by weight or volume as a single item, unless sold by the seller with utensils; ○ bakery items sold as such, including but not limited to bread, rolls, buns, biscuits, bagels, croissants, pastries, donuts, Danish, cakes, tortes, pies, tarts, muffins, bars, cookies and tortillas, unless sold by the seller with utensils; or ○ by a seller whose primary NAICS classification is manufacturing in sector 311, except sub-sector 3118 (bakeries); and • of food where plates, bowls, glasses or cups are necessary to receive the food. R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-4.13, replacing R.I. Regs. SU 09-59, effective July 23, 2018. The numbers combined above are the numerator. Divide the numerator by the denominator, which is calculated by adding all sales of food and food ingredients, both taxable and nontaxable, excluding any sale of alcohol. R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-4.13, replacing R.I. Regs. SU 09-59, effective July 23, 2018. After the division is complete a food vendor will fall into one of the following categories:• seller with 75 percent or less of sales coming from prepared food: Rhode Island will consider the seller to have supplied the customer with utensils only if it is the seller's practice to physically hand the utensil to the customer. Regarding plates, bowls, glasses, or cups which are necessary for the purchaser to receive food, the state considers these to be given by the seller so long as the vendor makes such equipment available to the consumer. • seller with greater than 75 percent of sales coming from prepared foods: The state considers the seller to have provided utensils to the customer so long as they are merely made available to the customer. Under this category, utensils located at a central kiosk are considered given to the customer for sales and use tax purposes. • seller with greater than 75 percent of sales coming from prepared foods selling items that contain four or more servings packaged as one: When sold for a single price, such a packaged item is not treated as prepared food solely because the seller has utensils available. However, if the seller specifically provides utensils for the item, item is considered prepared food. • seller selling food items containing utensils placed in a package by a person other than the seller: If the person who placed the utensils in the package is classified as a manufacturer the seller will not be considered to have provided the utensils for purposes of the sales tax. If any person other than a manufacturer placed the utensils in the package, for example a caterer, the seller will be considered to have provided the utensils to the consumer. R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-4.13, replacing R.I. Regs. SU 09-59, effective July 23, 2018. Local Meals and Beverages Tax(MBT) Rhode Island imposes an additional tax of 1 percent on every meal or beverage sold in Rhode Island by an eating and/or drinking establishment, whether or not the meal or beverage is prepared in that establishment or consumed in that establishment. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18-18.1. The local meals and beverage tax (MBT)is required to be separately stated from the state sales tax on the sales check or receipt, unless this causes a hardship to the business, in which case, the sales tax and the MBT may be combined. R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-4.6, replacing R.I. Regs. MBT 09-01, effective March 18, 2018, and amended effective July 23, 2018.

R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18-18.1; R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-4.8, replacing R.I. Regs. MBT 09-01, effective March 18, 2018, and amended effective July 23, 2018. If a bakery/café or delicatessen provides facilities for immediate consumption of prepared food or beverages, the entire store is considered an eating and/or drinking establishment and the MBT will apply to all sales at that location. If a bakery/caféor delicatessen does not provide facilities for immediate consumption of prepared food or beverages, the MBT does not apply. If a bakery/caféor delicatessen provides facilities for immediate consumption of prepared food and beverages in a specific area of the store and the prepared food and/or beverages are purchased from an employee or at a cash register in that area only, only those sales are subject to the MBT. R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-4.8, replacing R.I. Regs. MBT 09-01, effective March 18, 2018, and amended effective July 23, 2018. As a general rule, food stores and supermarkets do not qualify as eating and/or drinking establishments for purposes of the MBT. However, some food stores and supermarkets are exceptions to the general rule because they provide facilities for immediate consumption of prepared food or beverages. These stores or a specified area of the stores would qualify as an eating and/or drinking establishment when selling prepared food or beverages and sales of prepared food or beverages would be subject to the MBT on those receipts. R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-4.8, replacing R.I. Regs. MBT 09-01, effective March 18, 2018, and amended effective July 23, 2018. BNA-SUTN RI 11.2.1.
