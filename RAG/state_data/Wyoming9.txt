Enumerated Only Wyoming does not generally impose tax on the sale of services. However, services that are specifically stated in the imposition of sales tax provision are subject to tax. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-103(a). BNA-SUTN WY 9.2.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

True Object Test Charges for services accompanying the sale of tangible personal property are taxable and not deducted from the “sales price” where the service is necessary to complete the sale of the tangible personal property. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-101(a)(viii)(A)(III). Wyoming employs the true object test to determine whether a transaction involving a service along with either tangible personal property or another service is a bundled transaction. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-101(a)(xl). The retail sale of tangible personal property and a service where the tangible personal property is essential to the use of the service, and is provided exclusively in connection with the service, and the true object of the transaction is the service is not considered a bundled transaction. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-101(a)(xl)(C)(I). Similarly the retail sale of two services where 1 service is provided that is essential to the use or receipt of the other service and the other service is the true object of the transaction is not a bundled transaction. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-101(a)(xl)(C)(II). Charges for nontaxable services that are separately stated from the taxable charges on a sales invoice remain nontaxable. However, the entire invoice amount will be subject to the sales and use tax if the exempt charges are not separately shown and distinguishable from taxable charges. Wyo. Regs. ch. 2 §7(a). BNA-SUTN WY 9.3.1.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Bundled Transactions

Taxable Bundled transaction means the retail sale of two or more products, except real property and services to real property, where the products are otherwise distinct and identifiable, and the products are sold for one nonitemized price. A bundled transaction does not include the sale of any products in which the sales price varies, or is negotiable, based on the selection by the purchaser of the products included in the transaction. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-101(a)(xl). Distinct and identifiable products do not include packaging such as containers, boxes, sacks, bags, and bottles or other materials such as wrapping, labels, tags, and instruction guides that accompany the retail sale of the products and are incidental or immaterial to the retail sale. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-101(a)(xl)(A)(I). A product provided free of charge with the required purchase of another product is also not a distinct and identifiable product. A product is provided free of charge if the sales price of the product purchased does not vary depending on the inclusion of the product provided free of charge. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-101(a)(xl)(A)(II). Items included in the definition of sales price are not considered distinct and identifiable products. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-101(a)(xl)(A)(III). The phrase “one nonitemized price” does not include a price that is separately identified by product on binding sales or other supporting sales-related documentation made available to the customer in paper or electronic form, including an invoice, bill of sale, receipt, contract, service agreement, lease agreement, periodic notice of rates and services, rate card, or price list. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-101(a)(xl)(B). Transactions Not Considered Bundled Transactions A transaction that otherwise fits within the definition of bundled transaction is not considered a bundled transaction if one of the following situations applies:• the retail sale of tangible personal property and a service where the tangible personal property is essential to the use of the service, and is provided exclusively in connection with the service, and the true object of the transaction is the service; Wyo. Stat. §39-15-101(a)(xl)(C)(I). • the retail sale of services where one service is provided that is essential to the use or receipt of a second service and the first service is provided exclusively in connection with the second service and the true object of the transaction is the second service; Wyo. Stat. §39-15-101(a)(xl)(C)(II). • a transaction that includes taxable products and nontaxable products and the purchase price or sales price of the taxable products is de minimis; Wyo. Stat. §39-15-101(a)(xl)(C)(III). “De minimis” means the seller's purchase price or sales price of the taxable products is 10 percent or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled products. Sellers must use either the purchase price or the sales price of the products to determine if the taxable products are de minimis. Sellers may not use a combination of the purchase price and sales price of the products to determine if the taxable products are de minimis. Sellers must use the full term of a service contract to determine if the taxable products are de minimis. • the retail sale of exempt tangible personal property and taxable tangible personal property where: Wyo. Stat. §39-15-101(a)(xl)(C)(IV). o the transaction includes food and food ingredients, drugs, durable medical equipment, mobility-enhancing equipment, over-the-counter drugs, prosthetic devices, or medical supplies; and o if the seller's purchase price or sales price of the taxable tangible personal property is 50 percent or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled tangible personal property. Sellers may not use a combination of the purchase price and sales price of the tangible personal property when making the 50 percent determination for a transaction. Bundled Telecommunication Service, Ancillary Service, Internet Access or Audio or Video Programming Service Generally In a bundled transaction, the tax applies at the highest rate unless the provider can identify, from its books and records that are kept in the regular course of business, the portion of the price subject to lower or no tax. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-101(a)(xl)(D). Taxable and Nontaxable Products The portion of price attributable to the nontaxable product is subject to tax unless the provider can identify, by reasonable and verifiable standards, the portion of the products that are nontaxable from its books and records that are kept in the regular course of business for other purposes, including nontax purposes. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-101(a)(xl)(D)(I). Products Taxed at Different Rates The total price is treated as attributable to the products subject to tax at the highest rate unless the provider can identify, by reasonable and verifiable standards, the portion of the price attributable to the products subject to tax at the lower rate from its books and records that are kept in the regular course of business for other purposes, including nontax purposes. Wyo. Stat. §39-15-101(a)(xl)(D)(II). BNA-SUTN WY 9.3.2.
