Code §710:65-19-109(b). The “gross receipts” or “gross proceeds” in the case of a meal sold to an employee at a reduced price is the amount received for the meal from the employee in the form of cash, check or credit card chit. Each person required to make a sales tax report shall include in the gross proceeds the sales value of all tangible personal property that has been purchased for resale and has been withdrawn from stock in trade for use or consumption. Meals provided to employees free of charge are withdrawals from inventory used or consumed by the employer and sales tax is due on the sales value. “Sales value” in the case of meals is the cost of materials withdrawn from inventory to provide such meals. Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-19-109(b). Complimentary Meals for Customers The sales value of complimentary meals provided free of charge to customers are subject to sales tax. Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-19-109(c). Each person required to make a sales tax report shall include in the gross proceeds the sales value of all tangible personal property that has been purchased for resale and has been withdrawn from stock in trade for use or consumption and shall pay tax on such sales value. Meals provided to customers free of charge are withdrawals from inventory used or consumed by the employer and sales tax is due on the sales value. Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-19-109(c). Meals served free of any actual charge or cost to an employee or customer constitute a withdrawal from inventory of items purchased free of sales tax and such withdrawals are subject to sales tax. Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-19-109(d). When calculating sales tax liability, the sales value of free or complimentary meals is presumed to be the greater of any consideration received, or the cost or price paid by the vendor/taxpayer for the food items included in the free or complimentary meal served, pursuant to OAC 710:65-1-2. Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-19-109(d). Replacement Meals When an establishment provides a second meal in place of the first meal that was discarded because it did not meet the customer's specification, only one sale has been made, and sales tax is levied only on the replacement meal. If, rather than discarding the first meal, the establishment serves the meal to another customer or employee, two sales have been made, and sales tax is levied on both meals. Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-19-109(e). Discounted Meals Gross receipts from meals provided to customers at a reduced cost (i.e., discount or advertised special)are taxable. Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-19-109(f). The “gross receipts” or “gross proceeds” in the case of a meal sold to a customer at a reduced price is the amount received for the meal from the customer in the form of cash, check or credit card chit less any amount designated by the customer as voluntary tip(s). Okla. Admin. Code §710:65-19-109(f). When two items are provided by a restaurant, club or similar establishment (i.e., buy one, get one free or two for one sale), the “gross receipts” or “gross proceeds” derived from the sale of two items for the price of one is the total amount of cash, received less any amount designated by the customer as a voluntary tip.
