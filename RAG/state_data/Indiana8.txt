Indiana Revenue Ruling 2015-14ST (Jan. 15, 2016). The department concluded as follows:• aloe concentrate is a taxable soft drink because it is a liquid beverage that contains maltodextrin, a sweetener, and the label does not state the volume of vegetable or fruit juice; • aloe concentrate with mango flavoring is a taxable soft drink because it is a liquid beverage that contains maltodextrin and sucralose, which are sweeteners, and the label does not state the volume of vegetable or fruit juice; • herbal tea concentrate with peach flavoring is a taxable soft drink because it is a liquid beverage that contains fructose and maltodextrin, which are sweeteners; • protein powder is a tax exempt food item because, although it contains sweeteners, it is neither a soft drink, as it is not a liquid beverage, nor a candy, as it is not in bar, drop, or piece form; • protein bar with citrus lemon flavoring is a taxable candy item because does not appear to contain flour, and it contains multiple sweeteners; • protein drink mix with vanilla flavoring is a tax exempt food item because drink mixes are an exempt food ingredient. Although this item contains sweeteners, it is neither a soft drink, as it is not a liquid beverage, nor a candy, as it is not in bar, drop, or piece form; • orange fitness drink is a taxable soft drink because it is a liquid beverage that contains sugar and sucralose, which are sweeteners; • meal shake with vanilla flavoring is a tax exempt food item because, although it is a liquid beverage that contains sweeteners, it is not a soft drink because it contains milk and milk substitutes; • roasted soy nuts with chile lime flavoring are a taxable candy item because it contains sugar combined with nuts; • roasted salted soy nuts are a tax exempt food item because they do not contain sweeteners; • drink mix with wild berry flavoring is a tax exempt food item because drink mixes are an exempt food ingredient. Although this item contains sweeteners, it is neither a soft drink, as it is not a liquid beverage, nor a candy, as it is not in bar, drop, or piece form; • chocolate shake is a tax exempt food item because, although it is a liquid beverage that contains sweeteners, it is not a soft drink because it contains milk and milk substitutes; • peanut butter protein bar is a tax exempt food item, rather than a candy, because it contains flour; • cookies and cream meal bar is a tax exempt food item, rather than a candy, because it contains flour; • vanilla almond protein bar is a taxable candy item because does not appear to contain flour, and it contains multiple sweeteners; and • soup mix creamy chicken is an exempt food, as it contains no ingredients that would exclude it from the definition of a “food.” Indiana Revenue Ruling 2015-14ST (Jan. 15, 2016).

==================================================

Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Prepared Food Definition of 'Prepared Food'

Defined Indiana defines the term “prepared food.” Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-20(c)(5); Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 29 (April 2016). Indiana defines the term “prepared food” as food and food ingredients sold:• in a heated state or heated by retailer and ready to eat without further cooking by the purchaser; Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-20(c)(5); Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 29 (April 2016). • with retailer-provided eating utensils provided by the retailer; Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-20(c)(7); Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 29 (April 2016). and • mixed or combined as ingredients of a single item. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-20(c)(6); Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 29 (April 2016). Providing a microwave or toaster for customer use to eat frozen or refrigerated items not previously heated by the seller does not transform the item into prepared food. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 29 (April 2016). If a bakery sells prepared food, then the prepared food is subject to sales tax. Bakery items are tax-exempt unless sold with utensils, in a heated state, or from a vending machine. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 29 (April 2016). BNA-SUTN IN 11.2.2.

==================================================

Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Prepared Food Definition of 'Restaurant' or 'Eating Establishment'

Defined A “restaurant”is defined as a business that sells prepared foods such as meals or sandwiches, for consumption on or off the premises, and provides utensils, if at least 75 percent of the business's sales are of prepared food. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-20(c); Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 29 (April 2016). Indiana determines whether at least 75 percent of the business's sales are of prepared food by adding, in dollars, sales of food that are:• in a heated state or heated by the seller, other than bakery items; • containing two or more food ingredients mixed or combined by the seller for sale as a single item, other than bakery items; or • sold in such a way that plates, bowls, glasses, or cups are necessary to receive the food, including bakery items. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 29, Appendix B (April 2016). Then sales of all food should be calculated, in dollars, including prepared food, candy, dietary supplements and soft drinks. Any sales of alcoholic beverages should be subtracted from both figures, if included. The first figure should then be divided by the second figure to definitively determine whether an establishment is a restaurant. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 29, Appendix B (April 2016). If a business is a restaurant, all sales of food ready for immediate consumption are subject to tax. This includes self-service food items such as food from salad bars, prepared food sold as multiple servings, bakery items, and normally exempt items such as bottled water, fruit, and potato chips. Food sold without eating utensils provided by the restaurant and that ordinarily requires cooking (as opposed to reheating) by the consumer is still exempt. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 29, Appendix B (April 2016). A business that sells both prepared food and exempt food, but has less than 75 percent of total food sales from prepared food, is considered a combination business. Combination businesses are often grocery stores with a deli or cafeteria on the premises, convenience stores, or restaurants with a gift store or grocery store. Combination businesses must collect tax on all sales of prepared food. However, otherwise exempt food sold by a combination business is only taxable if utensils are handed to the customer. Handing utensils to a customer includes placing utensils in a bag or container handed to the customer. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 29, Appendix B (April 2016). Sales of food and beverages by concessionaires at the Indiana State Fair are subject to sales tax. Indiana Dep't. of Rev., The Indiana State Fair is in Full-Swing!. BNA-SUTN IN 11.2.3.

Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Prepared Food Definition of 'Immediate Consumption'

Not defined Indiana does not define “immediate consumption.” See Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-5-43. However, Indiana does state that food is sold for immediate consumption even if it is sold on a “take out” or “to go” basis, and is packaged and taken away from the premises of the seller. Where or when the customer eats the food is immaterial. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-5-43(a). Further, food for immediate consumption includes any food which is cooked to order for a specific purchaser, any food which is cooked and maintained at or near the cooking temperature prior to sale, and any prepared foods sold by the piece (rather than weight) or for immediate consumption. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-5-43(b). BNA-SUTN IN 11.2.4.

Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Prepared Food Prepared Food Items Sold With Eating Utensils Provided by Seller

Taxable Sales of prepared food items sold with eating utensils provided by the seller are subject to gross retail tax, regardless of where the items are sold. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-20(c)(7); Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-5-43(b); Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Taxability Matrix, Indiana (version 2018.0). Eating utensils include plates (but not containers), knives, forks, spoons, glasses, cups, napkins, or straws. Eating utensils are provided by the seller when given directly to the purchaser or made available for self-service on the seller's premises. However, a combination business that has both a store and a restaurant area is not considered to have provided utensils to the customer where the utensils are only made available for self-service if the business's sales of prepared food are less than 75 percent of the business's total sales. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 29 (April 2016). Prior to April 2016, a business was not considered to have provided utensils with the sale of food when the utensils were only available for self-service, unless it was intended that the food be consumed with those utensils. However, in April 2016, the Department of Revenue updated its guidance on this issue and utensils made available for self-service are considered provided by the seller, unless the exception above applies. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 29 (April 2016); see Indiana Letters of Findings 04-20160091, 04-20160093, 04-20160094, and 04-20160095 (Aug. 31, 2016) (allowing an exemption for taxpayer's sales of frozen cakes because the utensils were only available for self-service, but clarifying that the rule on this issue had changed after the years covered by the audit and that the exemption would no longer be allowed).
