Destination Sales of tangible personal property are subject to sales tax if title to or ownership of the property transfers in Missouri, unless the transaction is in commerce. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-113.200(1). In Missouri, a transaction is “in commerce” if the order is approved outside Missouri and the tangible personal property is shipped from outside Missouri directly to the buyer in Missouri Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-113.200(2)(B). Title transfers when the seller completes its obligations regarding physical delivery of the property, unless the seller and buyer expressly agree that title transfers at a different time. A recital by the seller and buyer regarding transfer of title is not the only evidence of when title passes. The key is the intent of the parties, as evidenced by all relevant facts, including custom or usage of trade. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-113.200(3)(A). When an out-of-state seller delivers tangible personal property to a third-party common or contract carrier for delivery to Missouri, title transfers in Missouri. If delivery is made to seller or an agent of seller (other than a third-party common or contract carrier) in Missouri and subsequently delivered to the buyer in Missouri, the sale is subject to Missouri sales tax. If delivery is made directly from the out-of-state seller to the buyer in Missouri, the sale is subject to sales tax if the order was approved in Missouri. If the order was approved outside Missouri, the sale is not subject to sales tax, but, but the transaction is subject to use tax unless otherwise exempt. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-113.200(3)(C).

A buyer that carries its own goods is not acting as a common or contract carrier. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-113.200(3)(B); see also Missouri Letter Ruling LR7868 (Sept. 13, 2017). When a Missouri retailer fulfills its customer's orders in Missouri by delivering the purchased items to the Missouri location of a common carrier designated on the customer's account, the purchases are subject to Missouri sales tax even when the common carrier ships the items to locations outside Missouri. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-113.200; Missouri Letter Ruling LR7340 (Dec. 20, 2013). The purchase of tangible personal property by an out-of-state purchaser from a Missouri seller is exempt from sales tax when the property is shipped from the seller's in-state location but possession is taken outside the state.
