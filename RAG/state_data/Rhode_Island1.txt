Destination-Based Rhode Island's sourcing provisions are destination-based. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18.1-11(A)(1) to (A)(5); see R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-25.7, replacing R.I. Regs. SU 07-56, effective March 17, 2018. A retail sale, excluding the lease or rental, of a product, is sourced as follows:• when a product is received by the purchaser at the seller's business location, the sale is sourced to that location; R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18.1-11(A)(1). • when the product is not received by the purchaser at the seller's business location, the sale is sourced to the location where receipt by the purchaser (or the purchaser's donee, designated as such by the purchaser)occurs, including the location indicated by instructions for delivery to the purchaser (or donee), known to the seller; R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18.1-11(A)(2). • when neither of the two above sections apply, the sale is sourced to the location indicated by an address for the purchaser that is available from the business records of the seller that are maintained in the ordinary course of the seller's business when use of this address does not constitute bad faith; R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18.1-11(A)(3). • when neither of the three above sections apply, the sale is sourced to the location indicated by an address for the purchaser obtained during the consummation of the sale, including the address of the purchaser's payment instructions, if not other address is available, when use of this address does not constitute bad faith; R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18.1-11(A)(4). and • when none of the above apply, or if the seller lacks sufficient information to apply the above rules, the location will be determined by the address(1) from which the tangible personal property was shipped; (2) from which the digital good or the computer software delivered electronically was first available for transmission by the seller; or (3) from which the service was provided (disregarding for these purposes any location that merely provided the digital transfer of the product sold). R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18.1-11(A)(5). For purposes of R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18.1-11(A), the term receive and receipt means:• taking possession of tangible personal property; R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18.1-12(A). • making first use of services; R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18.1-12(B). or • taking possession or making first use of digital goods, whichever comes first. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18.1-12(C). The term receive and receipt do not include possession by a shipping company on behalf of the purchaser. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18.1-12(C). The retail sale, including lease or rental, of transportation equipment is sourced according to the general sourcing principles described above. Transportation equipment means any of the following:• locomotives and railcars that are utilized for the carriage of persons or property in interstate commerce. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18.1-11(D)(1). • trucks and truck-tractors with a Gross Vehicle Weight rating of 10,001 pounds or greater, trailers, semi-trailers, or passenger buses that are: ○ registered through the International Registration Plan; and ○ operated under authority of a carrier authorized and certificated by the U.S. Department of Transportation or another federal authority to engage in the carriage of persons or property in interstate commerce; R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18.1-11(D)(2). • aircraft that are operated by air carriers authorized and certified by the U.S Department of Transportation or another federal authority to engage in the carriage of persons or property in interstate or foreign commerce; R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18.1-11(D)(3). and • any containers designed for use on and component parts attached or secured to the equipment described above. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18.1-11(D)(4). Direct Mail Sourcing On May 1, 2013, Rhode Island promulgated direct mail sourcing regulations that brought it into compliance with the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement. R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-1, replacing R.I. Regs. SST 13-01, effective March 12, 2018. Unless a purchaser of direct mail holds a direct pay permit, the purchaser must fill out a Direct Mail Form or other information indicating the jurisdictions involved in the sale. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18.1-14(A). Once the seller receives the Direct Mail Form, the purchaser is liable to pay taxes directly to the state, relieving the seller of the obligation to collect, pay, or remit the tax. A Direct Mail Form will remain in effect for all future sales or direct mail by the seller to the purchaser until it is revoked in writing. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18.1-14(A)(1). If the purchaser provides information that provides the jurisdiction that the sale took place rather than the aforementioned Direct Mail Form above, the seller must collect the tax according to the delivery information provided by the purchaser. Unless bad faith is established, the seller is relieved of any further obligation to collect tax on any transaction where the seller has collected tax based upon the delivery information provided by the purchaser. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18.1-14(A)(2). If the purchaser of direct mail does not have a direct pay permit and does not provide the seller with a Direct Mail Form or delivery information the seller must collect the tax and the location will be determined by the address from which the mail was shipped. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18.1-14(B); R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18.1-11(A)(5). If the direct mail purchaser provides the seller with documentation of direct pay authority, the purchaser will not be required to provide a Direct Mail Form or delivery information to the seller. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18.1-14(C). Sourcing of Use Tax The sourcing rules described above only apply to determine a seller's obligation to pay or collect and remit a sales or use tax with respect to the seller's retail sale of a product. These rules do not affect the obligation of a purchaser or lessee to remit tax on the use of the product to the taxing jurisdiction of that use. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18.1-10(A). BNA-SUTN RI 4.1.1.
