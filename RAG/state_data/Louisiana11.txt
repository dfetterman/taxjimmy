Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Sales Tax

Yes Louisiana imposes sales tax on tangible personal property when sold at retail in Louisiana. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:302(A)(1). Louisiana's sales tax is levied on the “sales price” of nonexempt tangible personal property sold at retail within the state. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:302(A)(1); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:321(A)(1); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:321.1(A)(1); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:331(A)(1). Louisiana's sales tax is levied on the “gross proceeds” of leases or rentals of tangible personal property within the state where such property is leased or rented in connection with the business of the owner of the property leased or rented. Otherwise, the sales tax imposed on leases or rentals of tangible personal property is levied on the monthly lease or rental price paid to the owner of the property. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:302(B); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:321(B); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:321.1(B); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:331(B). Louisiana sales tax is also imposed on amounts paid or charged for taxable services provided within the state. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:302(C)(1); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:321(C); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:321.1(C); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:331(C). BNA-SUTN LA 1.1.1.

Yes Louisiana imposes use tax on non-exempt tangible personal property used, consumed, distributed, or stored for use or consumption within Louisiana. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:302(A)(2). The use tax applies to purchases from out-of-state vendors, including online vendors, delivered within Louisiana, on which sales tax has not been paid. Louisiana Tax Topics – November 2013; see La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:321(A)(2); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:321.1(A)(2); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:331(A)(2). BNA-SUTN LA 1.1.2.

Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Local Option Sales and Use Tax

Local Tax Authorized The political subdivisions of Louisiana, including the governing authority of any parish or school board, are authorized to impose local sales and use taxes on the sale, use, lease or rental of tangible personal property or the sale of enumerated services within their geographic jurisdictions. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 47:338.52; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:338.54(A)(1). Economic development districts within the state also have the authority to impose sales and use tax at a rate of no more than 2 percent. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §33:9038.39; see Louisiana Attorney General Opinion No. 17-0173 (April 30, 2018). Additionally, Louisiana imposes a Louisiana Promotion District sales and use tax of 0.03 percent. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §51:1286(A). This tax goes to provide funds to promoting tourism in the district, but applies to all sales, leases, and rentals of tangible personal property or taxable services in the state, as well as to the use or consumption of any tangible personal property within Louisiana. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §51:1286(B). The Louisiana Promotion District sales tax applies to the same base, exclusions, and exemptions as the 0.97-percent sales tax imposed under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:331, bringing the total rate for that specific tax to 1 percent. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:331; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §51:1286(B); Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin No. 15-016 (June 29, 2015). From July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2019, Louisiana allows municipalities with a population between 30,500 and 30,700 (based on the latest federal decennial census) to create sales tax districts consisting of a portion of their respective municipalities. Each district can levy an additional 1-percent sales and use tax if approved by the majority of the voting district's electors. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:338.1(D)(1), as amended by 2016 La. S.B. 464, effective July 1, 2016. Similarly, during that time Louisiana allows municipalities with a population between 8,130 and 8,145 to use the proceeds of the additional sales tax levied under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:338.1(D)(1) as follows:• 50 percent of the proceeds annually for the municipality's operating budget as approved by the adoption of an ordinance of the governing authority of the municipality, by a two-thirds vote; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:338.1(E)(1)(a), as enacted by 2016 La. S.B. 464, effective July 1, 2016. and • 50 percent of the proceeds on new construction of infrastructure within the municipality or substantial improvements of existing infrastructure within the municipality. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:338.1(E)(1)(b), as enacted by 2016 La. S.B. 464, effective July 1, 2016. Challenges to the imposition of a local tax must be made within 60 days of an election to impose the tax. After that period ends, the tax may only be revoked through a new election. For example, the Town of Sterlington was unable to challenge the tax imposed by Ouachita Parish Police Jury that was enacted in 1977. Sterlington v. Ouachita Par. Police Jury, 150 So. 3d 944, 2014 BL 274812 (La. Ct. App. 2014). The combined sales and use tax rates levied by any school board and the governing authority of any municipality or parish within the same geographic area may not exceed 5 percent. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 47:338.54; see Louisiana Attorney General Opinion No. 17-0029 (Nov. 14, 2017) (where the 5-percent combined rate limitation prevented Lafourche District No. 4 from repealing an ordinance that voluntarily rolled back its 1-percent sales and use tax). The rate of any sales and use tax levied by a local law enforcement district within the same area is disregarded in applying this limitation. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 47:338.54. Notwithstanding this limitation, municipalities with a population between 12,850 and 13,250 according to the 2010 Federal Decennial Census are authorized to impose an additional sales and use tax at a rate of up to 1 percent. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:338.197, as added by 2014 La. S.B. 624, effective June 5, 2014. With respect to any local sales and use tax so imposed, the terms “sale,” “use,” “lease,” “rental,” “tangible personal property,” and “sale of services” are subject to the same definitions that apply to their use in the context of Louisiana state sales and use tax. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 47:338.25. Louisiana local sales and use taxes are legally imposed upon the purchaser of taxable tangible personal property or enumerated services. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.17(A)(1); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.17(A)(2); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.17(C). Sellers of these items or services are required to collect the tax arising from their sale and remit the tax to the appropriate tax collector. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.17(A)(1); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.17(A)(2); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.17(C). In the event that a purchaser does not pay over to a seller any local sales and use tax due, the amount of the unpaid tax constitutes a legally enforceable debt from the purchaser to the seller until paid. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.17(A)(2); La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.17(C). However, notwithstanding a seller's right to the payment of tax by the purchaser, where a seller fails to collect the tax due, the seller is liable for the payment of the tax to the appropriate tax collector. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:337.17(C). Uniform Application of Exclusions and Exemptions With respect to the applicability of sales and use tax exclusions and exemptions to local taxes, the Louisiana Supreme Court has ruled the state's constitution requires that legislative tax exclusions must treat all local taxing jurisdictions uniformly. Arrow Aviation Co. v. St. Martin Par. Sch. Bd. Tax Sales Dept., 2016 BL 407950, No. 2016-CA-1132, (La. 2016). The question of uniformity arose in this matter from a refund claim made by Arrow Aviation Company for sales and use taxes paid to St. Martin Parish School Board. Arrow Aviation claimed that sales and use tax should not have been imposed on its charges for repair services to property delivered to customers outside of Louisiana. The company relied on a state statute that excludes charges for certain repair services to tangible personal property that is then delivered out of state, from state sales and use tax, and from sales and use taxes imposed by East Feliciana Parish. Other parishes, municipalities, or school boards are permitted to apply the sales and use tax exclusion, but are not required to do so. See La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(14)(g)(i)(bb)(I). Arrow Aviation argued that the statute was unconstitutional because the sales tax exclusion was not mandatory for all local taxing jurisdictions, including the St. Martin Parish School Board. The Louisiana Supreme Court determined that the statute was unconstitutional, but not for the reasons proposed by Arrow Aviation. Ultimately, the court found that the statute was unconstitutional because the legislative tax exclusion was mandatory only for East Feliciana Parish, and consequently, did not treat “all local governmental subdivisions, school boards, and other political subdivisions” the same, as is required under Louisiana's constitutional provision addressing uniformly applicable tax exclusions. See La. Const. art. VI, § 29(D)(1). The court clarified that the constitutional uniformity provision does not mandate that all local authorities must uniformly apply a legislative tax exclusion but only that a legislative tax exclusion must treat all local authorities the same. Because the exclusion did not apply to all parishes “in the same form, manner, or degree,” the court severed the unconstitutional portion of the statute that made the exclusion mandatory only for East Feliciana Parish but permissive for all other local jurisdictions. The court remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. Arrow Aviation Co. v. St. Martin Par. Sch. Bd. Tax Sales Dept., No. 2016-CA-1132, 2016 BL 407950 (La. 2016). Special Districts New Orleans International Airport Sales Tax District The Louisiana legislature has authorized the city of Kenner to create a special tax district within the area of the New Orleans International Airport terminal building and airport concourses A, B, C, and D, to be designated as the “New Orleans International Airport Sales Tax District.” La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §33:2740.17(A)(1). The city is authorized to impose a generally applicable sales and use tax within the district at a rate of up to 2 percent, which tax will be levied in addition to, and without limiting the rate of, any other sales and use taxes levied within the district. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §33:2740.17(C). The proceeds of the tax remaining after payment of collection costs are to be distributed equally among the city of Kenner, the city of New Orleans, and the New Orleans Aviation Board. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §33:2740.17(D). Grant Economic Development District Effective June 5, 2013, the Louisiana Legislature has authorized the Grant Economic Development District to levy a sales and use tax, not to exceed 2 percent. The district must first hold an election to gain the approval of qualified electors, before which the district may decide any tangible personal property or services to exclude from the tax. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §33:130.153(10), as added by 2013 La. S.B. 195, effective June 5, 2013. Morgan City Development District Effective Aug. 1, 2014, the Louisiana Legislature has authorized the Morgan City Development District to levy a sales and use tax, not to exceed 1 percent. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §33:2740.32, as added by 2014 La. H.B. 582, effective Aug. 1, 2014. Opelousas Downtown Development District Louisiana has authorized a taxing district to benefit the city of Opelousas or St. Landry parish, specifically for making improvements to movable and immovable property and improvements owned or acquired by either the city or the parish. Effective June 22, 2017, the boundaries of the Opelousas Downtown Development District were revised. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §33:2740.39, as amended by 2017 La. S.B. 250, effective June 22, 2017. Bethany Convention Center Development District Effective June 23, 2017, Louisiana authorized the creation of the Bethany Convention Center Development District. This district is located in the city of Baker and in East Baton Rouge Parish. The district is authorized to levy a retail sales and use tax and a hotel occupancy tax for the purpose of the revitalization and economic development of the district. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §33:9038.71, as added by 2017 La. S.B. 227, effective June 23, 2017. Old LNB Building Redevelopment District Effective June 19, 2014, Louisiana authorized the Old LNB Building Redevelopment District, located in Baton Rouge, to levy an occupancy tax on hotel rooms, motel rooms and overnight camping facilities or to levy a sales and use tax. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §33:9038.67, as added by 2014 La. S.B. 648, effective June 19, 2014. French Quarter Economic Development District The French Quarter Economic Development District(FQEDD) is authorized to levy and collect a sales tax of up to 2 percent. However, the FQEDD may only levy and collect the additional sales tax if the sales tax increases are approved by a majority of voters in the FQEDD. The FQEDD may only use proceeds from a sales tax in the manner consistent with the purposes approved by the voters of the FQEDD. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §33:9038.31, et seq.; Louisiana Attorney General Opinion No. 15-0026; see City of New Orleans French Quarter Economic Development District (on Oct. 24, 2015, voters approved a 0.2495-percent sales tax ($0.25 per $100 purchase) within the boundaries of the French Quarter Management District with funds generated from the additional sales tax used to form the French Quarter Economic Development District and fund additional full-time Louisiana State Police trooper patrols in this area). Capital Improvement Districts A parish with a population of more than 440,000 persons as established by the most recent federal census are authorized to create one or more capital improvement districts within the parish boundaries. Each capital improvement district is authorized to levy a sales and use tax not to exceed 1 percent within the district for the purpose of funding capital improvement projects. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §33:2740.9, as amended by 2019 La. S.B. 226, effective June 4, 2019. Tax Increment Financing Districts Effective June 11, 2019, parishes in Louisiana with populations of over 440,000 persons are authorized to create tax increment financing districts for the purpose of economic development. These districts may impose sales and use taxes to fund economic development projects. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §33:9038.72, as added by 2019 La. S.B. 237, effective June 11, 2019. BNA-SUTN LA 1.1.3.

Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Excise and Replacement Taxes

Yes Excise Taxes Louisiana imposes a variety of excises taxes, although these taxes do not necessarily operate in a manner similar to the state's transactional sales and use tax. See e.g., La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §26:341. These excise taxes include alcoholic beverage taxes, cigarette taxes, and fuel taxes. See La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §26:341; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:854; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:818.13. For more information on excise taxes in Louisiana, see the Excise Tax Navigator, at Louisiana 1.1. Replacement Taxes The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement prohibits member states from imposing a “prohibited replacement tax,” which is a tax outside of the sales and use tax that is imposed on products defined in the Agreement. Generally, the Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board will make a finding regarding whether or not a member state has imposed a replacement tax. Louisiana is not a full member of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement. Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement as amended through December 16, 2016, §334. Although Louisiana is an advisory state of the Streamlined Sales Tax Project, it has not yet enacted legislation to comply with the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement. Louisiana has not entered into the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, but has passed legislation authorizing the Department of Revenue to enter into the Agreement, under certain conditions. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:335.4; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:335.6;Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Governing Board, State Info. BNA-SUTN LA 1.1.4.

Rate Change/Economic Nexus Extension of Temporary Sales Tax Rate Increase Louisiana's additional sales and use tax imposed under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:321.1 was set to expire on June 30, 2018. This measure has been extended to June 30, 2025; however, the rate increase has been reduced from 1 percent to 0.45 percent. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:321.1, as amended by 2018 La. H.B. 10, Third Extraordinary Session, effective July 1, 2018, and as enacted by 2016 La. H.B. 62, First Extraordinary Session, effective April 1, 2016. This brings Louisiana's full sales tax rate to 4.45 percent for the period from July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2025. Louisiana Dept. of Rev., New State Sales Tax Rate Goes Into Effect July 1 (June 24, 2018); see 2018 La. H.B. 10, Third Extraordinary Session, effective July 1, 2018. The additional sales tax was originally adopted early in 2016, in an effort to address a significant budget shortfall as a temporary 1-percent sales and use tax on retail sales of goods and taxable services within the state through June 30, 2018. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:321.1, as enacted by 2016 La. H.B. 62, First Extraordinary Session, effective April 1, 2016. In addition to increasing the sales tax rate, the legislature temporarily suspended a large number of existing exclusions and exemptions from the existing sales and use tax. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:302, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:321, and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:331 as amended by 2016 La. H.B. 61 and 2016 La. H.B. 62, First Extraordinary Session, effective April 1, 2016 and as amended by 2016 La. H.B. 51, Second Extraordinary Session, effective July 1, 2016; Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin No. 16-012 (March 23, 2016); Louisiana Publication R-1002A (January 2017); Louisiana Publication R-1002 (January 2017). The list of effective and temporary exclusions and exemptions was updated again in 2018. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:321.1, as amended by 2018 La. H.B. 10, Third Extraordinary Session, effective July 1, 2018, and as enacted by 2016 La. H.B. 62, First Extraordinary Session, effective April 1, 2016. All of the previous exemptions and exclusions remain in the state tax code. See, e.g., La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:305. However, each statute imposing sales tax contains a list of the only exemptions that will be allowed during a given time period. There is a list for exemptions in effect until June 30, 2018, and a separate list for exemptions in effect from July 1, 2018, to June 30, 2025. On July 1, 2025, these lists expire and the exemptions and exclusions in effect on March 31, 2016 will control, unless another change has been made. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:302, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:321, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:321.1, and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:331, as amended by 2018 La. H.B. 10, Third Extraordinary Session, effective July 1, 2018, and by 2016 La. H.B. 61 and 2016 La. H.B. 62, First Extraordinary Session, effective April 1, 2016, and by 2016 La. H.B. 51, Second Extraordinary Session, effective July 1, 2016; see Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin No. 16-012 (March 23, 2016); Louisiana Publication R-1002A (January 2017); Louisiana Publication R-1002 (January 2017). The legislative patchwork of the 1-percent tax increase (which has been updated to a 0.45-percent increase) and the intended and inadvertent suspensions of exclusions and exemptions, has left taxpayers struggling to determine which tax rate applies to which goods and services, and in which time period. The Louisiana Department of Revenue issued a massive matrix of exemptions and exclusions and the applicable total state tax rates for three different time periods: April 1 to June 30, 2016; July 1 to June 30, 2018; and July 1, 2018, to June 30, 2025. Louisiana Publication R-1002 (January 2019). The department also issued Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin No. 16-012 and Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin No. 16-013 to help explain the impact of the legislative changes that took place in 2016. Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin No. 16-012 (March 23, 2016); Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin No. 16-013 (March 24, 2016). As it stands now, certain taxable goods and services are temporarily subject to an additional 0.45-percent tax, certain normally excluded or exempt items are temporarily subject to the 0.45-percent tax, and certain other excluded and exempt items remain untaxed. See Louisiana Publication R-1002 (January 2019). The administration of these changes presents a significant challenge for both taxpayers and the department. Suspension of Sales Tax Holidays Louisiana's three sales tax holidays are suspended from July 1, 2018, through June 30, 2025. Items purchased during this period are taxable at the full state sales tax rate of 4.45 percent, unless another exemption applies. 2018 La. H.B. 10, Third Extraordinary Session, effective July 1, 2018; Louisiana Publication R-1002 (January 2019); Louisiana Revenue Information Bulletin 18-020 (July 11, 2018). For more information about sales tax holidays, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Louisiana 7.14. Economic Nexus Louisiana has enacted an economic nexus provision, which imposes sales and use tax collection requirements on out-of-state vendors who make sales delivered into Louisiana exceeding $100,000 in a calendar year and on out-of-state vendors who make 200 or more separate transactions delivered into Louisiana in a calendar year. The Louisiana Sales and Use Tax Commission for Remote Sellers must begin enforcing the economic nexus standard no later than July 1, 2020. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(4)(m)(i), as added by 2018 La. H.B. 17, effective June 12, 2018; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:340(G)(6)(b), as amended by 2019 La.

The court of appeals has ruled that a marketplace facilitator with a physical presence in Louisiana is a “dealer”who must collect sales tax on third-party transactions with Louisiana customers. Normand v. Wal-Mart.com USA, LLC, No. 18-CA-211, 2018 BL 479815 (La. Ct. App. Dec. 27, 2018). For more information on economic nexus, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Louisiana 3.1.2.4.

Defined Louisiana defines “tangible personal property” as personal property that can be seen, weighed, measured, felt or touched, or is in any other manner perceptible to the senses. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(16)(a); La. Admin. Code tit. 61, §4301(Tangible Personal Property)(a). “Tangible personal property” does not include stocks, bonds, notes, or other obligations or securities and proprietary geophysical survey information or geophysical data analysis furnished under a restricted use agreement even though transferred in the form of tangible personal property. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(16)(b)(i) and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(16)(b)(iii), as amended by 2016 La. H.B. 62, First Extraordinary Session, effective April 1, 2016; La. Admin. Code tit. 61, §4301(Tangible Personal Property)(d). Tangible personal property generally also excludes gold, silver, or numismatic coins, and platinum, gold, or silver bullion having a total value of $1,000 or more. However, these items are temporarily subject to tax through June 30, 2018. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. §47:301(16)(b)(ii), as amended by 2016 La.
