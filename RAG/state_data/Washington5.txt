Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Real Property

Depends In Washington, sales of land or completed buildings are not subject to sales and use tax. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.020. Real property includes any beneficial interest in land or anything affixed to land. Wash. Rev. Code §82.45.032. Real property may include: • standing timber, • mobile homes, • park model trailers, and • floating homes. Wash. Rev. Code §82.45.032; see also Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 06-0245R (Feb. 28, 2017). Sales of completed buildings are not subject to sales tax because the price paid is for a sale of real estate, not for construction services or materials. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-170(2)(c). However, when a speculative builder sells property upon which he is presently constructing a building, all construction done subsequent to the date of such sale constitutes a retail sale and that portion of the sales price allocable to construction done after the agreement is subject to sales tax. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-170(2)(c); see Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 13-0076 (taxpayer not considered speculative builder when property is owned by a legally distinct subsidiary) (Oct. 4, 2011); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 13-0227 (Aug. 31, 2016). “Retail sale”means every sale of tangible personal property to all persons, including persons who install, repair, alter, improve, construct, or decorate real property for consumers, subject to specified exceptions. Wash. Rev. Code §82.04.050. BNA-SUTN WA 28.1.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal General Rule for Classification

Three-part Test Washington applies a three-part test to determine whether tangible personal property affixed to real property becomes a “fixture” and thus part of the real property. See Total Terminals International LLC v. Washington Dept. of Rev., No. 10-079 (Wash. Bd. Tax App. Dec. 30, 2011); Washington Excise Tax Advisory 3124.2009. “Fixture” is defined as an item of personal property that has been converted to real property by being permanently affixed to the realty. Fixtures include air conditioning units, furnaces, plumbing fixtures, conveyors, electric generators, elevators, and cranes. However, the Washington Board of Tax Appeals determined that cranes leased to a taxpayer by the Port of Seattle were subject to tax because the cranes were tangible personal property, rather than fixtures classified as real property exempt from sales tax. Total Terminals International LLC v. Washington Dept. of Rev., No. 10-079 (Wash. Bd. Tax App. Dec. 30, 2011); Washington Excise Tax Advisory 3124.2009. To prove an item is a fixture, and therefore real property, a taxpayer must show:(1) actual annexation to the realty, or appurtenances thereto; (2) application to the use or purpose to which that part of the realty to which it is connected is appropriate; and (3) the intention of the party making the annexation is to make a permanent accession to the freehold. Total Terminals International LLC v. Washington Dept. of Rev., No. 10-079 (Wash. Bd. Tax App. Dec. 30, 2011); APL Ltd. et al v. Washington Dept. of Rev., No. 70469-9-I (Wash. Ct. App. Mar. 31, 2014); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 06-0245R (Feb. 28, 2017). The Washington courts do not support the theory of constructive annexation because they believe that it will blur the lines between the first and second element. Thus, loose parts are not actually attached to the realty and therefore are not fixtures. In addition, equipment held in place solely by gravity, that is only minimally connected to the realty and can be easily and quickly removed, is likewise not annexed. Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 06-0245R (Feb. 28, 2017); see also Wash. Admin. Code §458-61A-102; Wash. Rev. Code §82.45.060. The Washington courts have stated that intent is the most important element of the fixtures test. Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 06-0245R (Feb. 28, 2017) (citing Glen Park Assocs. v. Washington Dept. of Rev., 82 P.3d 664, 119 Wash.App. 481 (Wash. Ct. App., Div. 2 2003)). Evidence of intent is gathered from the circumstances at the time of installation. Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 06-0245R (Feb. 28, 2017). The court determines the party's intent to affix items through objective evidence rather than through the party's subjective belief. Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 06-0245R (Feb. 28, 2017). Factors pertinent to intent include “the nature of the article affixed, the relation and situation to the freehold of the annexor, the manner of annexation, and the purpose for which annexation is made.” Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 06-0245R (Feb. 28, 2017) (quoting Union Elevator &Warehouse Co., Inc. v. State ex rel. Dept. of Transp. 144 Wn. App. 593, 603-604, 183 P.3d 1097, 1102 (2008)). BNA-SUTN WA 28.2.1.

Washington Tax Topics –Interior Cleaning Services; Washington Excise Tax Advisory 3209-2018 (May 23, 2018). These taxable services do not include janitorial services. Nontaxable “janitorial services”include cleaning and caretaking services ordinarily performed by janitorial service businesses. Wash. Rev. Code §82.04.050(2)(d); see Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 12-0348 (May 30, 2014) (water damage restoration services performed with respect to carpets damaged by flooding were taxable as building cleaning); Washington Tax Topics –Exterior Cleaning of Windows and Walls (exterior and interior window washing is a janitorial service not subject to retail sales tax, while exterior wall cleaning is subject to retail sales tax); Washington Dept. of Rev., 2016 Tax Exemption Study.

Services on Foreclosed Properties Cleanup services on foreclosed properties for consumers (e.g., for banks, realtors, or investors), often provide a combination of services for either an agreed-upon lump sum price or an amount to be based on the actual time spent cleaning up the property. Businesses performing these types of cleanup services on foreclosed properties are generally making retail sales, and must collect and report retail sales tax. These cleanup jobs do not qualify for the exclusion for “janitorial services” because the services provided by these businesses are beyond the scope of cleaning and caretaking services ordinarily provided by commercial janitorial businesses. These services are considered special cleanup jobs and may include, but are not limited to:• Securing the site by: ○ rekeying doors ○ replacing or boarding up windows ○ securing other openings ○ performing winterization services ○ making safety repairs • Lawn and yard services, including: ○ mowing ○ trimming ○ sweeping sidewalks and pathways • Cleaning, including: ○ personal property and debris removal ○ wiping down or replacing fixtures ○ vacuuming ○ mopping ○ disinfecting ○ plastering/drywall repair ○ painting ○ pressure washing ○ roof and gutter cleaning Wash.

No. 14-0310 (March 31, 2016) (a taxpayer that designs and installs merchandise displays and promotional graphics inside retail stores is engaged in “decorating”existing buildings, and “installing” tangible personal property in existing buildings, and the decorating and installing are retail-taxable services). This includes charges for clearing land and moving earth other than leveling land used in commercial farming or agriculture. Wash. Rev. Code §82.04.050(2)(b). Other services directly related to constructing, building, repairing, improving, or decorating buildings or other real property structures are also subject to tax. Wash. Rev.

Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-170(1)(a). Prime contractors are required to collect from consumers the retail sales tax measured by the full contract price for any taxable services to real property. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-170(4)(a); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 14-0298 (May 31, 2017) (where a contractor identifies and hires subcontractors, has control over subcontractors' work, and reviews and monitors the work of subcontractors, the contractor is acting as a prime contractor and its services are taxable). Taxable retail sales also include constructing, repairing, or improving any real property structure if the owner of the property conveys title or possession to a service provider to perform the service and the service provider later reconveys the property back to the owner once the service is complete. Wash. Rev. Code §82.04.050(2)(c). There is an exception from the general imposition of tax on real property construction, repair, or improvement when the services relate to public road construction. Wash. Rev. Code §82.04.050(10). Another exception applies when the services are performed on property owned by the U.S. government or a county or city housing authority. Wash. Rev. Code §82.04.050(12). The providers of contracting or labor services are required to collect and remit tax on the sales price of the contracting or labor services provided to the customer. However, it is the duty of the buyer to ensure that the tax is paid to the state. Therefore, when tax has not been collected and remitted for contracting or labor services, the buyer is liable for the payment. Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 11-0280. Related-Party Transactions In a 2015 tax decision, the Department of Revenue's appeals division determined that where a construction company “loaned”its construction employees to perform work on the residential and commercial properties owned by its affiliate, in exchange for the amount of payroll owed by the construction company to the affiliate, the transaction was subject to tax. By loaning employees to its affiliate(a real property holding company), the construction company performed as a custom prime contractor, the construction services of which were taxable under Washington's retailing business and occupation tax and retail sales tax. Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0315 (Nov. 18, 2015); see Wash. Rev. Code §82.04.260; Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.020; Wash. Rev. Code §82.04.050(2)(b).

Wash. Rev. Code §82.04.050(1).

Washington Excise Tax Advisory 3198.2016 (January 12, 2016). If retail sales tax is not paid at the time of purchase, the obligor must pay deferred sales tax or use tax on the parts and materials. If an obligor hires another party to perform the repair work, the person making the repairs is making a retail sale to the obligor and must collect retail sales tax on the invoiced amount, and remit it along with the retailing business and occupation tax on its excise tax return. Again, if retail sales tax is not paid at the time of purchase, the obligor must pay deferred sales tax or use tax on the parts and materials. Washington Excise Tax Advisory 3198.2016 (January 12, 2016). If the home service contract provides additional coverage for tangible personal property, income from sales of the additional coverage is subject to the retailing business and occupation tax and the retail sales tax. Washington Excise Tax Advisory 3198.2016 (January 12, 2016). Purchases of repair parts may be purchased for resale by the obligor if they are purchased to replace or become an ingredient or componant of tangible personal property covered by the addendum and the repair services are provided pursuant to the addendum.

Taxable Government contractors are subject to use tax on materials used by them on construction project with government entities. See Wash Admin. Code § 458-20-17001(5). Washington does not apply the reseller's exemption to tangible personal property purchased by contractors and used under exempt construction contracts with the United States or a county or city housing authority, and the contractors are treated as the end consumers subject to use tax on these items. Wash. Rev. Code §82.04.190(6); Wash Admin. Code § 458-20-17001(5); Wash Admin. Code § 458-20-17001(7); see also Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 16-0248 (Aug. 11, 2016)(government contractor liable for use tax on both delivery charges and cost of materials for construction project on military base). This applies to any person engaged in the business of constructing, repairing, decorating, or improving new or existing buildings or other structures under, upon, or above real property of or for the United States, any instrumentality thereof, or a county or city housing authority, including the installing or attaching of any article of tangible personal property therein or thereto, whether or not such personal property becomes a part of the realty by virtue of installation; also, any person engaged in the business of clearing land and moving earth of or for the United States, any instrumentality thereof, or a county or city housing authority.

Wash Admin. Code § 458-20-17001(8). Use tax is required to be reported and paid by the contractor who actually installs or applies the property, regardless of whether that contractor is a prime contractor or subcontractor. Wash Admin. Code § 458-20-17001(9); see also Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 16-0248 (Aug. 11, 2016). In either the case of tangible personal property purchased by the contractor or transferred from an exempt contractee to the contractor, use tax is due on the retail selling price of the tangible personal property, or in the absence of such a selling price, as nearly as possible according to the retail selling price at the place of use of similar products of like quality and character or, in the absence of either of these selling price measures, the value may be determined upon a cost basis. Wash. Rev. Code §82.12.010(7)(b). In addition to the use tax measured by value, government contractors who manufacture or produce any tangible personal property for their own commercial or industrial use as consumers in performing government contracting activities are subject to business and occupation tax under the manufacturing classification measured by the value of the property manufactured or produced. Wash Admin. Code § 458-20-17001(4). Retail sales subject to Washington's retail sales tax do not include charges for labor and services rendered to construct, repair, decorate, or improve new or existing buildings or other structures under, upon, or above real property of the United States or a county or city housing authority. Wash. Rev. Code §82.04.050(12); Wash Admin. Code § 458-20-17001(1); Wash Admin. Code § 458-20-17001(5).
