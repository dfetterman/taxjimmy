Topic: Administration and Procedure Vendor/Seller Registration

Required Every person maintaining a place of business or stock of goods, or is engaging in business activities within the state is required to obtain a certificate of registration from the Department of Revenue. Wash. Rev. Code §82.12.040(1); Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.030(1). All persons agreeing to collect and remit sales and use tax to the Department of Revenue must register through the central registration system. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.030(3). Once obtained, a registration certificate is nontransferable and is valid only as long as the taxpayer continues in business and pays the accrued tax to the state. In the event that business is transacted at two or more separate places by one taxpayer, a separate registration certificate for each place is required. Each certificate is numbered and must state the taxpayer's name, residence, and place and character of business. The vendor certificate must be posted conspicuously. If a taxpayer's place of business changes, the taxpayer must return the existing certificate, and a new certificate will be issued for the new place of business. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.030(1). Washington has the Unified Business Identifier (UBI) program to simplify the registration and licensing requirements. Completion of the master application enables a taxpayer to register with several state agencies, including the Department of Revenue, using a single form. The Unified Business Identifier Number assigned to a taxpayer will be used for all state agencies participating in the UBI program. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-101(6). A temporary revenue registration certificate may be issued to any person who operates a business on a temporary basis. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-101(8), renumbered, effective June 6, 2016. Temporary businesses are those with definite, predetermined dates of operation for no more than two events each year, with each event lasting no longer than one month. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-101(7)(a), amended effective June 6, 2016. Prior to June 6, 2016, businesses with seasonal operation dates lasting no longer than three months could also qualify as temporary businesses. When a change in ownership of a business occurs, the new owner must apply for and obtain a new registrations and licenses document. Change in ownership occurs in the following circumstances, but is not limited to:• the sale of a business by one individual, firm, or corporation to another individual, firm or corporation; • the dissolution of a partnership; • the withdrawal, substitution, or addition of one or more partners where the general partnership continues as a business organization and the change in the composition of the partners is equal to or greater than 50 percent; • incorporation of a business previously operated as a partnership or sole proprietorship; • changing from a corporation to a partnership or sole proprietorship; or • changing from a corporation, partnership or sole proprietorship to a limited liability company or a limited liability partnership. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-101(11). Change in ownership does not occur upon:• the sale of all or part of the common stock of a corporation; • the transfer of assets to an assignee for the benefit of creditors or upon the appointment of a receiver or trustee in bankruptcy; • the death of a sole proprietor with a continuous operation of the business by the executor, administrator, or trustee of the estate or, where the business was owned by a marital community or registered domestic partnership, by the surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner of the deceased owner; • the withdrawal, substitution, or addition of one or more partners where the general partnership continues as a business organization and the change in the composition of the partners is less than 50 percent; or • a change in the trade name under which the business is conducted. Wash. Admin. Code § 458-20-101(11)(b). Any person engaging in a business activity requiring registration with the Department of Revenue is required to obtain a tax registration endorsement. A failure to do so is a gross misdemeanor. If a taxpayer continues to engage in business after their registration has been revoked, regardless of whether other licensing endorsements may exist on the business license document, the taxpayer is committing a Class C felony. Wash. Admin. Code § 458-20-101(17). The Department of Revenue may revoke a taxpayer's registration if any of the following occur: • the taxpayer fails to pay any tax warrant issued under Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.210 within 30 days after it has been filed with the clerk of the superior court; • the taxpayer is delinquent for three consecutive reporting periods in remitting tax collected; • the taxpayer is convicted of violating Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.290(4), which prohibits the sale, purchase or use of automated sales suppression devices or phantom-ware, and continues to engage in business without fully complying with this section; or • a person who is an owner, officer, director, partner, trustee, member, or manager of the taxpayer is convicted of violating Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.290(4) and the taxpayer continues to engage in business without both the taxpayer and the person fully complying with this section. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-101(16)(a). Crowdfunding Project creators having annual gross income(donation amount and host fee) from crowdfunding in excess of $12,000 must register with the Department of Revenue. Project creators required to collect sales tax on a reward also must register with the department. Washington Tax Topics –Crowdfunding. Independent Consultants in Direct Sales Independent consultants working with direct selling organizations to sell products must register with the Washington Department of Revenue if:• The direct selling organization does not have a tax collection agreement and the consultant either has an annual gross income of at least $12,000 or is required to collect retail sales tax regardless of the amount; or • The direct selling organization has a tax collection agreement to remit retail sales tax for consultants and the consultant has either annual retail sales of at least $89,172 or annual commission of at least$56,000. Independent consultants are not required to register with the department if the direct selling organization has a tax collection agreement to report both business and occupation (B&O) tax and retail sales tax on behalf of its consultants. Washington Tax Topics –Direct Sales Independent Consultants. Special Event Promoters Special event promoters are required to make a good faith effort to verify that each vendor at their events has obtained a certificate of registration. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.033(1); Washington Special Notice May 2, 2018. If a special event promoter fails to do so, the Department will impose a penalty of $100 for each vendor permitted to make or solicit retail sales of tangible personal property or services at the special event. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.033(3); Washington Special Notice May 2, 2018. Special event promoters must also: (1) keep a record of the dates and place of each special event, and the name, address, and registration certificate number of each vendor permitted to make or solicit retail sales of tangible personal property or services at the special event; and (2) provide to the department, within twenty days of receipt of a written request from the department, a list of vendors permitted to make or solicit retail sales of tangible personal property or services. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.033(2); Washington Special Notice May 2, 2018. A promoter failing to provide such a list within twenty days will be subject to a penalty of $250 plus $100 for each vendor for whom the information is not provided. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.033(3); Washington Special Notice May 2, 2018. For a first offense of failing to satisfy any combination of the above requirements, the Department will not impose total penalties in excess of $2,500. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.033(4); Washington Special Notice May 2, 2018.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Tax Collection and Remittance

Seller Each seller is required to collect from the buyer the full amount of the tax for each taxable sale. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.050(1). Sellers that fail to collect sales tax or fail to remit it to the Department remain personally liable for the amount of the tax due. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.050(3); see Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 14-0412 (Sept. 30, 2015) (taxpayer failed to collect tax and was unable to provide a reseller's permit from the buyer; thus, the seller was liable for the unpaid tax); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 14-0410 (Dec. 23, 2014)(concluding that a building contractor must remit over-collected sales tax to the Department of Revenue). Generally, a retail seller must collect sales tax from the buyer based on the selling price and remit the tax to the state. However, where a seller advertises that its prices include sales tax, or that it is “absorbing”the tax, the department may not consider the advertised price to be the selling price. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.050(9); Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-124; Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 14-0081 (Mar. 27, 2015); Washington Dept. of Rev. v. Bi-Mor Inc., 286 P.3d 417 (Wash. Ct. App. Oct. 9, 2012) (the department later amended Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-107 to reflect the court's decision in Bi-Mor). In Washington Dept. of Rev. v. Bi-Mor Inc., the Washington Court of Appeals court ruled that when a seller advertises its price as including tax, the seller is not required to separately state the sales tax on invoices or receipts from tax-included sales. Washington Dept. of Rev. v. Bi-Mor Inc., 286 P.3d 417 (Wash. Ct. App. Oct. 9, 2012) (the department later amended Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-107 to reflect the court's decision in Bi-Mor. Sellers are relieved from personal liability for the amount of tax if they receive a fully completed exemption certificate or capture the relevant data required under the streamlined sales and use tax agreement within ninety days after the date of sale. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.050(7). Until the tax is paid by the buyer to the seller or the Department of Revenue, the tax constitutes a debt from the buyer to the seller. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.050(8). When a buyer fails to pay to the seller the tax imposed and the seller has not paid the amount of the tax to the Department of Revenue, the Department of Revenue may, in its discretion, proceed directly against the buyer for collection of the tax. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.050(10); see also Ass'n of Wash. Bus. v. Washington Dept. of Rev., 120 P.3d 46 (Wash. 2005) (department may promulgate rules and regulations, and act with discretion where legislature has empowered it to do so). In such an event a penalty of 10 percent may be added to the amount of the tax for failure of the buyer to pay the same to the seller. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.050(10). A person is not obligated to collect the tax if the person's activities within the state, whether conducted directly or through another person, are limited to:• the storage, dissemination, or display of advertising; • the taking of orders; or • the processing of payments; and • if the activities are conducted electronically by a website on a server or other computer equipment located in Washington that is not owned or operated by the person making sales into Washington, nor owned or operated by an affiliated person. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.050(11). But see Washington Tax Topics –Crowdfunding (A crowdfunding project creator must collect sales tax on donations from any backer that receives retail services (e.g., meals), tangible personal property(e.g., books, videos or copies of games), or digital products as a reward for contributing to a project, and report the donations in the reporting period when the project is fully funded). The tax collected by the seller is held in trust by the seller until remitted to the Department of Revenue. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.050(2); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 14-0125 (Mar. 27, 2015). Such tax is prohibited from being used to pay other corporate or personal debts. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-217(8). A seller failing to collect the tax or failing to pay the tax to the department, regardless of whether the failure is the result of the seller's own acts or conditions beyond his or her control, is personally liable for the tax. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.050(3); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 14-0125 (Mar. 27, 2015). Sellers are not relieved from personal liability for the amount of tax, unless they maintain proper records of exempt transactions. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.050(4). Furthermore, if a warrant is issued for the collection of unpaid tax from a business entity that is terminated, dissolved, abandoned, or insolvent, the department may impose personal liability against any or all responsible individuals. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-217(8). A responsible individual includes any current or former officer, manager, member, partner, or trustee of a limited liability business entity. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-217(8)(a)(i); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 14-0238 (July 25, 2015) (taxpayer was found to have been chief financial officer of dissolved corporation and was held personally liable for unpaid sales taxes, despite taxpayer's claim that his title was “Controller”and that he had no independent authority to collect or remit sales taxes; taxpayer was held personally liable only for unpaid taxes that accrued during the period before taxpayer's position was terminated). Distinctions between legal entities are honored by the department; as long as two organizations are separate legal entities they will be assessed separately, even if they are closely related Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 17-0269 (Nov. 3, 2017) (assessments against a sole proprietorship and a corporation, both owned by the same person, was not “double taxation”). BNA-SUTN WA 31.3.1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Business Owners, Operators

Yes Officers and other responsible persons may be personally liable for unpaid taxes, penalties and interest of a corporation or other business entity. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.145. For former chief executives or chief financial officers, liability will apply regardless of fault or whether the individual was, or should have been aware of, the unpaid liability. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.145; see, e.g., Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 18-0139 (May 24, 2018)(former president of a closed corporation constituted a chief executive strictly liable for the corporation's tax liability); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0081 (Sept. 30, 2015) (roles titled “President” and “Managing Member” are roles of a chief executive corporate officer, such that the person with those titles, in the absence of other specific officers, will be personally liable for an LLC's unpaid taxes; not being solely responsible for the business's financial decisions does not affect personal liability); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0212 (Nov. 30, 2015) (taxpayer was the President of the company and served as chief executive officer; thus, he was strictly liable for the unpaid tax liability); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0115 (Nov. 30, 2015)(the managing member of the LLC was strictly liable for unpaid taxes); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0240 (June 24, 2016) (the former Vice President member of a defunct LLC was not strictly liable where the LLC's President was the highest ranking executive manager). For other individuals, liability will apply only if he or she willfully fails to pay taxes or causes them to be unpaid to the department. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.145; see, e.g., Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0057 (Sept. 30, 2015)(an LLC owner's knowledge of the financial trouble of the business, along with his collection of retail sales taxes but using them to pay other business obligations instead of remitting them to the Department, constitutes a willful failure to pay taxes; thus, the owner was personally liable the LLC's unpaid taxes). “Willful failure” means that the failure to pay tax was the result of an intentional, conscious and voluntary course of action. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.145(9)(i). Officers and other responsible individuals cannot contest an assessment made against a business entity if the entity, as the original taxpayer, did not appeal the assessment. Once the 30-day period for challenging an assessment has past, the assessment becomes final and an officer being held personally liable cannot challenge it. Instead, the officer or responsible party can pay the assessment and petition for a refund, contesting the underlying liability during the refund proceeding. See Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 18-0139 (May 24, 2018) (president could not challenge the underlying tax assessment following expiration of the 30-day period); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0058 (Oct. 30, 2015) (corporate officer's challenge to the assessment was denied because it concerned the original assessment against the taxpayer's foundation, which had not been challenged; taxpayer can pay the tax liability and file a claim for refund to challenge the assessment itself). The department can collect unpaid taxes against a responsible person even if the department could collect against a successor because there is joint and several liability for the unpaid tax. See Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 14-0350 (Oct. 30, 2015) (taxpayer was a responsible individual and could not shield himself from liability even though he sold the business and that person would also be liable for the unpaid tax).

Relieves Liability Washington relieves sellers and certified service providers (CSP) from tax liability to Washington and its local jurisdictions for having charged and collected the incorrect amount of sales and use tax resulting from relying on erroneous data in the library of definitions section of the Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board Taxability Matrix for Washington. Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Taxability Matrix, Washington (version 2018.0); Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, User Guide: Online Taxability Matrix and Certificate of Compliance (Nov. 20, 2018). Additionally, until the first day of the calendar month that is at least 30 days after notice, a seller or CSP will not be held liable for tax, interest, or penalties resulting from collection of incorrect that was collected based upon their reliance on the prior version of the matrix after the State has changed its definition or tax practice administration sections of its SST Matrix.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Certified Service Providers

Relieves Liability In Washington, a certified service provider is considered an agent of a seller. As such, the certified service provider is liable for sales and use tax due each member state on all sales transactions it processes for the seller. Wash. Rev. Code §82.58.080(1) A seller that contracts with a certified service provider is not liable to the state for sales or use tax due on transactions processed by the certified service provider unless the seller misrepresented the type of items it sells or committed fraud. In the absence of probable cause to believe that the seller has committed fraud or made a material misrepresentation, the seller is not subject to audit on the transactions processed by the certified service provider.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Due Date Filing

25th of the Month Washington law requires that any person or business liable for collecting and remitting sales and use tax file a sales and use tax return with the Department of Revenue. Any outstanding tax liability must be paid when the return is filed. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-22801(1). The period within which a taxpayer must file a return with the Department of Revenue depends on the taxpayer's estimated tax liability. If a taxpayer's estimated annual tax liability exceeds $4800 per year the taxpayer must file their return on a monthly basis. If the taxpayer's estimated annual liability is less than $1,050 the taxpayer may file an annual return. If the taxpayer's estimated annual tax liability exceeds $1,050 but is not more than $4,800, the taxpayer must file a quarterly return. However, the Director of Revenue may, at their discretion, allow a taxpayer or group of taxpayer's to file their returns on a more or less frequent schedule if it enables the Department of Revenue to better administer the tax code. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-22801(2)(a)-(b). Annual Filers Taxpayers with an estimated annual tax liability of less than $1,050 may file their return once annually. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-22801(2)(a). The taxpayer's return must be filed within 25 days after the end of the month in which the taxable activities occur. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.045. Quarterly Filers Taxpayers with an estimated annual tax liability exceeding $1,050 but less than $4800 per year must file a quarterly return. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-22801(2)(a).

Topic: Administration and Procedure Due Date Payment

Due with Filing Generally, combined excise tax returns with payments of the tax due are to be filed monthly within 25 days after the end of the month in which the taxable activities occur. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.045(1); Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-22801(2). However, the Department of Revenue may require any taxpayer or class of taxpayers to file returns that cover longer periods of time not in excess of one year and has done so with respect to returns with estimated tax of less than $4,800 per year. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.045; Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-22801(2). The Department of Revenue may also require verified annual returns from any taxpayer as it may deem necessary to correctly determine tax liability. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.045(3). A taxpayer must report and pay taxes due on a monthly basis if the annual estimated tax liability is over $4,800 per year. If the annual estimated tax liability is between $1,050 and $4,800 per year returns and tax must be paid quarterly. If the annual estimated tax liability is less than $1,050 per year then the taxpayer must file an annual return. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-22801(2)(a). When a taxpayer requests a more or less frequent reporting frequency, the Department of Revenue may approve of the request if it is in the opinion of the Department of Revenue that the change assists the Department of Revenue in efficient and effective administration of Washington tax law. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-22801(2)(b). No change in reporting frequency will be effective except upon at least thirty days advance written notice to the taxpayer at the taxpayer's last reported business address. Wash. Admin.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Due Date Extensions Extensions for Good Cause

Available The department, for good cause shown, may extend the time for making and filing any return for a reasonable time period. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.080.4(a)(i). However, any permanent extension granting the taxpayer a reporting date without penalty that is more than 10 days beyond the due date, and any extension in excess of 30 days is only permitted if the taxpayer provides a deposit with the department in an amount approximately equal to the estimated tax liability for the reporting period for which the extension is requested. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.080.4(a)(i). The deposit must be submitted to the state treasury with other tax funds and a credit recorded to the taxpayer's account which may be applied to taxpayer's liability upon cancellation of the permanent extension or upon reporting of the tax liability where an extension of more than thirty days has been granted. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.080.4(a)(ii). BNA-SUTN WA 31.5.3.1.

St. Reg.13-22-47 Effective November 31, 2013; Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.080.(2)(a); see also Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 16-0048 (Feb. 1, 2016). Waiver for “good cause” is generally temporary. Reasons for good cause include, but are not limited to the following• The taxpayer does not have the necessary equipment or software; • The equipment or software necessary is not functioning properly; • The taxpayer does not have access to the internet using the taxpayers own equipment; • The taxpayer does not have a bank account or credit card; • The taxpayer's bank is unable to send or receive electronic funds transfer transactions; or • Some other circumstance or condition exists that, in the department's judgment, prevents the taxpayer from complying. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-22802(2)(b) as amended by Wash. St. Reg.13-22-47 effective Nov. 31, 2013; see also Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 16-0048 (Feb. 1, 2016). Electronic funds transfer (EFT) means any transfer of funds, other than a transaction originated or accomplished by conventional check, drafts, or similar paper instrument, which is initiated through an electronic terminal, telephonic instrument, or computer or magnetic tape so as to order, instruct, or authorize a financial institution to debit or credit a checking or other deposit account. Electronic funds transfer includes payments made by electronic check (e-check) Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-22802(3)(i)(A); . If the taxpayer wishes to use e-check, they must enter their bank account and routing number for each payment transaction. The e-check transaction authorizes the department to withdraw the payment amount from the taxpayer's bank account. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-22802(3)(a)(iii)(C) If the taxpayer pays taxes on the combined excise tax return by EFT debit, the taxpayer is entitled to a refund of those taxes by EFT. If the taxpayer wishes to have the refund made by EFT, the taxpayer must provide the department with the information necessary to make an appropriate EFT transaction or the refund will be issued as a paper check. No electronic adjustments or refunds are made directly to taxpayer credit card accounts or on e-check transactions Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-22802(4). The EFT payment is due on or before the next banking day following the tax return due date:• An EFT payment made using the EFT debit or e-check method is timely if the payment is initiated on or before 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on the tax return due date, and the effective date for that payment is on or before the next banking day following the tax return due date; • An EFT payment made using the EFT credit method is timely when the state receives collectible U.S. funds on or before 5:00 p.m., Pacific Time, on the EFT payment due date; • The ACH system, either EFT debit or EFT credit, requires that the necessary information be in the originating bank's possession on the banking day preceding the date for completion of the transaction. Each bank generally has its own transaction deadlines and it is the responsibility of the taxpayer to ensure timely payment; • The tax return due date is the next business day after the statutory due date if the statutory due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. Legal holidays are determined under state of Washington law and banking holidays are those recognized by the Federal Reserve System. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-22802(3)(a)(iv). Voluntary Use of EFT When a taxpayer voluntarily uses the EFT credit payment method but files a paper return, the department will match the payment with the return. A return will be considered timely filed only if it is received by the department on or before the tax return due date. The associated EFT credit payment must be received by the next banking day after the tax return due date. If the return is sent through the U.S. Postal Service, it will be considered received on the date shown by the post office cancellation mark stamped on the envelope. RCW 82.32.080. If both events occur, there is timely filing and payment and no penalties apply. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-22802(5). BNA-SUTN WA 31.6.1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Certificates Required

Yes A seller who accepts a fully completed current exemption certificate or captures the relevant data required under the streamlined sales and use tax agreement within 90 days subsequent to the date of sale is relieved of personal responsibility for the collection of retail sales or use tax. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.050(7)(a). If the seller has not obtained an exemption certificate or all relevant data elements required under the streamlined sales and use tax agreement within the 90 day period allowed subsequent to the date of sale, the seller may, within one hundred twenty days, or a longer period as may be provided by rule by the department, subsequent to a request for substantiation by the department, either prove that the transaction was not subject to tax by other means or obtain a fully completed exemption certificate from the purchaser, taken in good faith.

Sellers are relieved from personal liability for the amount of tax if they obtain a blanket exemption certificate for a purchaser with which the seller has a recurring business relationship. The department may not request from a seller renewal of blanket exemption certificates or updates of exemption certificate information or data elements if there is a recurring business relationship between the buyer and seller. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.050(7)(c). The burden of proving that a sale is a wholesale sale rather than a retail sale is on the seller. A seller may meet its burden of proving a sale is a wholesale sale rather than a retail sale by taking from the buyer, at the time of sale or within a reasonable time after the sale as provided by rule of the Department of Revenue, a copy of a reseller permit issued to the buyer by the Department of Revenue. Wash. Rev. Code §82.04.470(1); see Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0104 (Sept. 30, 2015) (absent evidence that taxpayer accepted reseller permits or other authorized exemption forms, taxpayer failed to meet burden of proving that handyman services were wholesale sales rather than retail sales). Sellers cannot accept blanket exemption certificates for items that are clearly not encompassed within a statutory exemption. Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0181 (Jan. 31, 2016).

Wash. Rev. Code §82.04.470(6). A seller that meets the requirements of this subsection will be deemed to have met its burden of proving a sale is a wholesale sale rather than a retail sale. Wash. Rev. Code §82.04.470(6). Sellers accepting blanket certificates are relieved from personal liability for the amount of tax if they obtain a blanket exemption certificate for a purchaser with which the seller has a recurring business relationship.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Resale Exemption Certificates

Not Accepted Effective Jan. 1, 2010, the resale certificate was replaced with a reseller permit issued by the Department of Revenue. Even though resale certificates are no longer used after Dec. 31, 2009, they must be kept on file by the seller for five years from the date of last use or Dec. 31, 2014. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-10201, effective Aug. 1, 2010; Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-102A. A resale certificate obtained prior to Jan. 1, 2010, may not be used in lieu of a reseller permit to prove that sales made on or after Jan. 1, 2010, were sales for resale. See, e.g., Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 14-0155 (Sept. 30, 2014). Taxpayers that consume and resell certain types of personal property may use a reseller permit when making purchases if they cannot determine whether all the property being purchased will be consumed or resold. This option is available only to buyers who “principally” resell that type of property as a part of the taxpayer's business. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.130(1). “Principally” means more than 50 percent of the time. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-102(12). Taxpayers must then remit use tax on purchased articles that are consumed and not resold. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.130(1); Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-102(12). Taxpayers that do not remit tax on the consumed purchases are then subject to reseller permit misuse penalties imposed under Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.291. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-102(9); see Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0132 (Jan. 31, 2016).

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Direct Pay Permits

Authorized The Director of the Department of Revenue may grant a direct pay permit to a taxpayer satisfying certain requirements. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.087(2)(a). More specifically, direct pay permits may be granted if:• the taxpayer's cumulative tax liability is reasonably expected to be $240,000 or more in the current calendar year; or • the taxpayer makes purchases subject to the taxes imposed under Washington Revenue Code chapter 82.08 or 82.12 in excess of 10 million dollars per calendar year. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.087(2)(a). A direct pay permit allows the taxpayer to accrue and remit directly to the Department of Revenue use tax on the acquisition of tangible personal property or sales tax on the sale of or charges made for labor and services. Any taxpayer that uses a direct pay permit must remit tax directly to the Department of Revenue, rather than pay sales or use tax to the seller. The seller is relieved of the obligation to collect sales and use tax while the buyer is obligated to pay use tax on the tangible personal property and sales tax on the sale of or charges made for labor and services. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.087(1). An application for a direct pay permit must be made in writing to the Director. The Department of Revenue must approve or deny an application based on the applicant's ability to comply with:• local government use tax coding capabilities and responsibilities; • requirements for vendor notification; • recordkeeping obligations; • electronic data capabilities;and • tax reporting procedures. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.087(2)(b)-(c). However, an application may be denied if the Director determines that denial would be in the best interest of tax collection. The direct pay permit clearly states that the holder is solely responsible for the accrual and payment of the tax and that the seller is relieved of liability to collect tax on all sales to the direct pay permit holder. The taxpayer may petition the Director for reconsideration of a denial. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.087(2)(c). Any taxpayer using a direct pay permit must continue to maintain records that are necessary for a determination of tax liability. A direct pay permit is not transferable and the use of a direct pay permit may not be assigned to a third party. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.087(2)(d). Taxes for which the direct pay permit is used are due and payable on earlier period of the tax return for the reporting period in which the taxpayer:• receives the tangible personal property purchased or in which the labor and/or services are performed; or • receives an invoice for such property or such labor and/or services. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.087(3). The holder of a direct pay permit must provide a copy of the direct pay permit to each vendor. Sellers who make sales where the sales or use tax is not collected due to the direct pay permit must maintain a copy of the direct pay permit and any such records or information as the Department of Revenue specifies. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.087(4). A direct pay permit may be revoked by the Director any time that the taxpayer has violated any provision of the applicable law or the revocation would be in the best interest of collecting taxes. The notice of revocation must be in writing and effective either as of the end of the taxpayer's next normal reporting period or a date deemed appropriate by the director and identified in the revocation notice. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.087(5). A direct pay permit that is no longer used by the holder or that is revoked by the Department of Revenue must be returned to the Department of Revenue immediately. The taxpayer must make an immediate good faith effort to notify all vendors to whom the permit was given. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.087(6). The direct pay permit may be used for any purchase of tangible personal property and any retail sale; however, the direct pay permit may not be used for:• purchases of meals or beverages; • purchases of motor vehicles, trailers, boats, airplanes, and other property subject to requirements for title transactions by the Department of Revenue of licensing; • purchases for which a seller's permit or uniform exemption certificate; • purchases that meet the definition of Wash. Rev. Code §82.04.050(2)(e)and (f), (3)(a) through (d), (f), and (g), and (5); or • other activities subject to retail sales and use tax for which a direct pay permit is not appropriate and may not be used. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.087(7). BNA-SUTN WA 31.8.10.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Record-Keeping Requirements

5 years The general record-keeping requirements imposed on taxpayers are to retain and make available those records necessary to verify that the correct tax liability has been reported and paid by the taxpayer with respect to the taxes administered by the Department of Revenue. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-254(1). It is the duty of each taxpayer to prepare and preserve all records in a systematic manner conforming to accepted accounting methods and procedures. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-254(3). The records must be kept, preserved, and presented upon request of the Department of Revenue that will demonstrate: • the amounts of gross receipts and sales from all sources, however derived, including barter or exchange transactions, whether or not such receipts or sales are taxable; • the amounts of all deductions, exemptions, or credits claimed through supporting records or documentation required by statute or administrative rule, or other supporting records or documentation necessary to substantiate the deduction, exemption, or credit; • the payment of retail sales tax or use tax on capital assets, supplies, articles manufactured for your own use, and other items used by the taxpayer as a consumer;or • the amounts of any refunds claimed. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-254(3)(b); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 13-0267 (prime contractor that failed to maintain invoices showing that it previously paid tax on its purchase of certain items it sold was properly denied a tax paid at source deduction for the items); see also Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0315 (Nov. 18, 2015) (denying request to adjust audit assessment where taxpayer failed to provided documentation in support of its claim); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0104 (Sept. 30, 2015) (upholding sales and use tax assessment levied against taxpayer providing handyman services who failed to provide invoices or other documentation that would allow the Department of Revenue to determine taxpayer's gross proceeds); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0067 (Sept. 30, 2015) (denying claim for an additional tax paid at source deduction where taxpayer failed to provide records to show tax was paid on purchases). All records must be available for inspection and examination at any time by the Department of Revenue, upon reasonable notice, and must be kept for a period of five years. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-254(4); Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.070(1); Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-15503(607) (relating to digital products). If a taxpayer retains records in both machine-sensible and hard-copy formats, the taxpayer must make the records available to the Department of Revenue in machine-sensible formation upon request by the Department of Revenue. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-254(3)(d). Machine-sensible records used to establish compliance must contain sufficient transaction-level detail information so that the details underlying the machine-sensible records can be identified and made available to the Department of Revenue upon request. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-254(3)(e). Taxpayers are not required to construct machine-sensible records other than those created in the ordinary course of business. Additionally, a taxpayer who does not create the electronic equivalent of a traditional paper document in the ordinary course of business is not required to construct such a record for tax purposes. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-254(3)(g). Any taxpayer who fails to comply with the recordkeeping requirement is barred from questioning, in any court action or proceedings, the correctness of any assessment of taxes made by the Department of Revenue based upon any period for which such books, records, and invoices have not been so kept, preserved, or disclosed. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-254(5); Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.070(1); see Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0323 (Jan. 31, 2016) (motel operator did not maintain records demonstrating that it was not liable for sales tax on stays by “nontransient guests”that stayed at the motel for more than 30 days during the audit period); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 13-0237R (the Washington Department of Revenue could assess additional use tax on motor vehicles where the value of the vehicles recorded in a taxpayer's books, records and federal depreciation schedules was higher than the value reported to the Department of Licensing). If a taxpayer fails to provide records as required, the Department of Revenue is authorized to estimate the tax due in such a manner as it may deem best. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.100(1); see Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0104 (Sept. 30, 2015) (department's reliance on bank records to estimate handyman's tax liability was not unreasonable in light of his failure to provide suitable records of actual proceeds from sales); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0067 (Sept. 30, 2015) (department authorized to estimate tax liability where taxpayer failed to maintain or provide adequate books and records necessary to determine liability). When a taxpayer uses electronic data interchange processes and technology, the level of record detail, in combination with other records related to the transaction, must be equivalent to that contained in acceptable paper record. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-254(6)(a). An out-of-state business that does not keep the necessary records within this state may either produce in Washington such records as are required for examination by the Department of Revenue or permit the examination of the records by the Department of Revenue where the records are kept. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-254(10); Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.070(1). Effective July 1, 2019, a nonresident claiming exemption from sales tax must pay the state and local sales tax to the seller at the time of purchase and then request a refund of the tax from the department with proof of the person's nonresident status at the time of purchase. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0273(3), as amended by 2019 Wash. S.B. 5997, effective July 1, 2019. However refunds may only be requested by nonresidents for the immediately preceding calendar year, and the requested amount must be $25 or more. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0273(4), as amended by 2019 Wash. S.B. 5997, effective July 1, 2019. Prior to July 1, 2019, retailers are not required to collect tax on sales to out-of-state purchasers that qualify. Wash. Rev. Code §82.08.0273(1); Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.070(1). Prior to July 1, 2019, the retailer is required to examine the purchaser's out-of-state identification and record for each taxable sale for the following:• the type of identification; • the identification number; and • the expiration date of the identification. Retailers who fail to comply will be liable for sales tax on these purchases. See Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 14-0318 (Oct. 2, 2014) (seller of nutritional and homeopathic products keeping only customer names and addresses to document sales to nonresidents failed to maintain adequate records to substantiate these claimed tax-exempt sales); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 12-0349 (Mar. 31, 2014)(wrecking yard operator and seller of salvaged parts failing to record expiration dates of out-of-state purchasers' identification cards was held liable for sales tax on related sales); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 13-0249 (Feb. 28, 2014) (seller of pet supplies failing to record expiration dates of out-of-state purchasers' identification cards was held liable for sales tax on related sales); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 12-0134 (June 27, 2013). Motor Vehicles Sales to Nonresidents When a vehicle is delivered outside the state by a common carrier acting as the seller's agent, the seller must retain:• evidence that the vehicle's license plates (if licensed in Washington) were removed; and • a signed copy of the bill of lading issued by the carrier. The bill of lading must show the seller as the consignor and indicate that the carrier agrees to transport the vehicle to a point outside the state or have a Seller's Certificate Out-of-State Delivery, signed by the person who delivers the vehicle and provides the name of the hauling company. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-177(4)(c). The seller must exercise a reasonable degree of care in accepting statements regarding a buyer's nonresidence. If delivery occurs in-state, the seller must examine and retain a copy of at least one form of documentary evidence showing the buyer's out-of-state residence. Lack of good faith on the part of the seller or lack of the exercise of the degree of care required is indicated, for example, if: • the seller knows that the buyer is living in Washington; • the buyer gives a Washington address for the purpose of financing the purchase of the vehicle; • at the time of sale, arrangements are made for future servicing of the vehicle in the seller's shop and a Washington address or telephone number is shown for the shop customer; or • the seller has ready access to any other information that discloses that the buyer is a resident of Washington. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-177(6)(a). Buyers are responsible for providing the seller with valid identification that entitles the buyer to purchase a motor vehicle, trailer, or camper exempt from retail sales tax. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-177(11). BNA-SUTN WA 31.9.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Refunds

Both Any person having paid any tax, original or additional assessment, or corrected assessment may apply to the Department of Revenue within the statute of limitations for a refund by petition in writing for a correction of the amount paid, and a conference for examination and review of the tax liability. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.170. The petition must set forth the reasons why the conference should be granted and the amount in which the tax, interest, or penalty should be refunded. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.170. The Department of Revenue must promptly consider the petition. The taxpayer will be notified by mail or electronic means as to whether a hearing has been granted. If so, the notice will state the time and place where the hearing will be held. After the hearing the Department of Revenue must make a determination as may appear just and lawful, and must mail a copy to the taxpayer, or provide a copy of its determination electronically. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.170. No refund or credit may be made for taxes, penalties, or interest paid more than four years before the beginning of the calendar year in which a refund application is made or examination of records by the Department of Revenue is completed. A valid petition must be filed within the statutory period, which may not be extended or tolled, unless a waiver extending the time for assessment has been entered into. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-229(2)(a). The time limits relate to the date the taxes, penalties, or interest is paid. A refund application can be timely even though the payment concerned liabilities for a tax year normally outside the time limits. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-229(2)(b). Refund From a Seller If a buyer pays retail sales tax on a transaction that the buyer later believes was not taxable, the buyer should request a refund or credit directly from the seller from whom the purchase was made. If the seller determines the tax was not due and issues a refund or credit to the buyer, the seller is entitled to a refund equal to the amount refunded to the customer. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-229(4)(a). Refund From the Department of Revenue In situations where the buyer has not received a refund from the seller, the Department of Revenue will refund retail sales tax directly to a buyer. The buyer must file a complete refund application and either a seller's declaration or a buyer's declaration, under penalty of perjury for each seller. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-229(2)(b). Refund for Adapted Housing for Disabled Veterans Effective July 23, 2017, Washington will issue sales tax refunds to eligible purchasers under a program for adapted housing for disabled veterans. An eligible purchaser is a disabled veteran who has received a specially adapted housing grant or a special housing adaptation grant from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Washington Special Notice July 23, 2017. Qualified veterans who have paid sales/use tax on materials, labor, and services for an adapted housing project may request a refund of the state portion of the sales/use tax paid.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Statute of Limitations Refund Requests

4 Years No refund or credit may be made for taxes, penalties, or interest paid more than four years before the beginning of the calendar year in which a refund application is made or examination of records by the Department of Revenue is completed. A valid petition must be filed within the statutory period, which may not be extended or tolled, unless a waiver extending the time for assessment has been entered into. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-229(2)(a). The time limits relate to the date the taxes, penalties, or interest is paid. A refund application can be timely even though the payment concerned liabilities for a tax year normally outside the time limits. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-229(2)(b); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 17-0294 (Dec. 1, 2017) (limit is relative to when the tax was paid, rather then when the taxpayer was billed). BNA-SUTN WA 31.11.1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Statute of Limitations Assessment of Additional Tax

4 Years Generally, tax assessments must be made within four years from the tax year in which the tax was incurred. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-230(2). With respect to the assessment of use tax on tangible personal property, the statute of limitations begins to run on the return due date for the period during which the property is first used in a nonexempt manner. See Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 13-0312 (Feb. 10, 2015). The four year statute of limitations does not apply to the following:• a taxpayer who was not registered even though required; • a showing of fraud or misrepresentation of a material fact by the taxpayer; • where the taxpayer has executed a written waiver of such limitation; or • sales tax was collected by a seller upon retail sales and the tax was not remitted to the Department of Revenue. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-230(2). An assessment generally cannot be increased from the amount originally assessed for those years for which the four-year statute of limitations would have expired if it were an original assessment. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-230(7); see Cascade Concrete, Indus. v. Washington Dept. of Rev., No. 85855(Wash. Bd. Tax. App. Sept. 30, 2015) (the Department's deduction of a 2006 tax credit from a 2007 credit was impermissible because the deduction indirectly increased the tax due for 2006 after the statute of limitations period had expired for 2006). If the Department of Revenue discovers any unregistered taxpayer doing business in Washington, it may assess taxes, interest, and penalties for a period of seven years plus the current year. If a taxpayer voluntarily registers before being contacted by the Department of Revenue, the assessment cannot cover more than four tax years plus the current tax year, provided that the taxpayer made a good faith attempt to report correctly and there is no evidence of intent to evade tax under Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.050. There is a presumption that the taxpayer has registered if the taxpayer voluntarily files for an identification number under the Unified Business Identifier(UBI) system before any contact from the Department of Revenue. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-230(3); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0043 (March 30, 2018) (where a taxpayer rescinded its registration, but is doing business in Washington, it is unregistered for purposes of extending the statute of limitations on assessments). Evasion or Misrepresentation of a Material Fact There is no statute of limitation for an assessment made upon a showing of evasion or of misrepresentation of a material fact. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-230(4). Evasion involves a situation where the taxpayer knows a tax liability is due and the taxpayer attempts to escape detection through deceit, fraud, or other intentional wrongdoing. The Department of Revenue must show the evasion by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that is objective and creditable. Any assessment for taxes that extends beyond four years and the current year will be limited to taxes that were underpaid as a result of the evasion or misrepresentation. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-230(4). The Department of Revenue may request that a taxpayer complete a waiver of the statute of limitations in those cases where the delay in timely completing an audit or issuing an assessment is the result of the actions of the taxpayer. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-230(5). A statute of limitations waiver holds open the period during which it may refund taxes that have been overpaid. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-230(4). The statute of limitation does not apply to sales tax collected by a seller and not remitted to the Department of Revenue. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-230(6). BNA-SUTN WA 31.11.2.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Civil Penalties

Yes In addition to interest, Washington imposes a range of civil and criminal penalties on individuals or businesses that violate tax laws and regulations relating to sales and use tax. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.050; Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.090(1), as amended by 2015 Wash. S.B. 6138, effective, August 1, 2015; Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-228(5)(a); Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-228(5)(b). Late Payment of a Return Effective August 1, 2015, a 9 percent penalty is imposed if the tax due on a taxpayer's return is not paid by the due date. A total penalty of 19 percent is imposed if the tax due is not paid before the first day of the second month following the due date, and a penalty of 29 percent is imposed if the tax due remains unpaid on the first day of the third month following the due date. Prior to August 1, 2015, these penalties were imposed at the rates of 5 percent, 15 percent, and 25 percent, respectively. The minimum penalty for late payment is five dollars. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.090(1), as amended by 2015 Wash. S.B. 6138, effective, August 1, 2015; Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-228(5)(a). Unregistered Taxpayer When a person engages in a taxable activity and does not voluntarily register prior to being contacted by the Department of Revenue, a penalty of 5 percent of the tax is imposed. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.090(4); Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-228(5)(b). A taxpayer voluntarily registers when they properly complete and submit a master application to any agency or entity participating in the Unified Business Identifier (UBI) program for the purpose of obtaining a UBI number before any contact from the Department of Revenue. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-228(5)(b). A person has not voluntarily registered if a UBI number is obtained by any means other than submitting a properly completed master application. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-228(5)(b). Assessment When the Department of Revenue issues an assessment for substantially underpaid tax, a penalty of at least 5 percent will be added to the assessment. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.090(2); Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-228(5)(c). If any tax is not paid by the due date or the extended due date, the penalty will increase to a 15 percent of the amount of tax that remaining unpaid. If any tax included in the assessment is not paid within 30 days of the original or extended due date, the penalty will be increased to a total of 25 percent of the outstanding tax liability. The minimum for this penalty is five dollars. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-228(5)(c); Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.090(2). Taxes are considered substantially unpaid where:• the taxpayer has paid less than 80 percent of the amount of tax determined by the Department of Revenue to be due for all of the types of taxes included, and for the entire period of time covered by the Department of Revenue's examination; and • the amount of underpayment is at least $1,000. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-228(5)(c)(i). If the initial 5 percent assessment penalty is included with an assessment when it is issued, the penalty is calculated against the total amount of tax that was not paid when originally due and payable. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-228(5)(c)(ii). Issuance of a Warrant If the Department of Revenue issues a tax warrant for the collection of any fee, tax, increase, or penalty, an additional penalty of 10 percent of the amount of tax due, will be added to the taxpayer's total tax liability. This penalty will never be less than 10 dollars. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-228(5)(d); Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.090(3). Disregard of Specific Written Instructions If the Department of Revenue determines that a taxpayer has disregarded specific written instructions as to reporting of tax liabilities, or willfully disregarded the requirement to file returns or remit payment electronically, a penalty of 10 percent must be added. The penalty will be calculated on the total tax liability. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-228(5)(e); Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.090(5). Disregarded Transaction If the department finds that all or any part of a deficiency resulted from engaging in a disregarded transaction, the department must assess a penalty of 35 percent of the additional tax found to be due as a result of engaging in same. The penalty provided in this subsection may be assessed together with any other applicable penalties provided in this section on the same tax found to be due, except for the evasion penalty. The department may not assess the penalty under this subsection if, before the department discovers the taxpayer's use of a disregarded transaction, the taxpayer makes a voluntarily discloser. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.090(6); see Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0171 (July 29, 2016) (affirming the negligence penalty for taxpayer's failure to follow instructions to prepare and preserve records in an organized manner, make records available on a timely basis and report finance charges). Evasion If a deficiency results from an intent to evade the tax due, a further penalty of 50 percent of the additional tax due will be imposed. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.090(7). The penalty applies when a taxpayer knows a tax liability is due but attempts to escape detection or payment of the tax liability through deceit, fraud, or other intentional wrongdoing. The Department of Revenue has the burden of showing the existence of an intent to evade a tax liability through clear, cogent, and convincing evidence. Intent does not exist where a deficiency is due to an honest mistake, miscommunication, or lack of knowledge regarding proper accounting methods. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-228(5)(f); see Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 14-0072 (Feb. 27, 2014) (evidence that the taxpayer substantially underreported income and failed to maintain records established an intent to evade their tax liability); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 14-0268 (Dec. 30, 2014) (taxpayer's strained financial circumstances did not negate its intent to evade, but instead explained its motivation to evade). Examples of intent to evade include, but are not limited to:• the use of an out-of-state address (e.g., the residence of a relative, mail forwarding or post office box location, motel, campground, or vacation property)by a Washington resident to register property to avoid a Washington excise or use tax, when at the time of registration the taxpayer does not reside at the out-of-state address on a more than temporary basis; • the willful failure of a seller to remit retail sales taxes collected from customers to the Department of Revenue; and • the alteration of a purchase invoice or misrepresentation of the price paid for property (e.g., a used vehicle) to reduce the amount of tax owing. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-228(5)(f)(ii); see Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 16-0066 (Feb. 12, 2016) (evasion penalty ruled appropriate because taxpayer modified invoices from retail to wholesale during the audit period, however, because some changes were deemed valid, the penalty is limited to those instances where the taxpayer intentionally misrepresented retail transactions as exempt wholesale sales); see also Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0067 (March 12, 2015) (sustaining 50 percent penalty for intent to evade retail sales tax where taxpayer invoices show consistent collection of tax from customers, but taxes were never remitted to Department of Revenue). Misuse of Resale Certifications Any buyer who fraudulently uses a resale certificate or reseller permit to purchase items or services free from tax will be assessed a penalty of 50 percent of the tax due. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.291(1); Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-228(5)(g). The penalty applies regardless of whether the taxpayer intended to misuse the resale certificate. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-228(5)(g). Beginning July 1, 2010, a purchaser is deemed to improperly use a reseller permit and is subject to the penalty if the purchaser:• furnished its seller with a reseller permit number, a reseller permit or copy of a reseller permit, or other authorized documentation to avoid payment of sales tax; or • made the purchase from a seller that had previously used electronic means to verify the validity of the purchaser's reseller permit and, as a result, did not require the purchaser to provide a copy of its reseller permit or furnish other authorized documentation to document the wholesale nature of the purchase. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.291(3). In this second case, the purchaser bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a seller with which it has a previous selling relationship did not use electronic means to verify the purchaser's reseller permit. Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0284 (Oct. 23, 2015). See also Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 16-0307 (May 31, 2017). Even when a taxpayer does not intend to evade sales tax, the penalty will apply where a reseller permit has been misused. See Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0308 (May 31, 2016) (sales tax was due on purchases the taxpayer made as a government contractor because the taxpayer was purchasing items as a consumer, not as a government entity itself; tax was legally due on materials and supplies used in the taxpayer's government contractor activities). Failure to Remit Sales Tax to Seller A 10 percent penalty may be assessed against a buyer who fails to pay the seller the sales tax on taxable purchase; however this penalty only applies only if the Department of Revenue proceeds directly against the buyer for the tax liability. This penalty is additional to any other penalties or interest that may be assessed to or owed by the taxpayer. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-228(5)(h). The law may impose more than one type of penalty on the same tax liability with the following requirements:• the penalties imposed for the late payment of a return, unregistered taxpayer, assessment, and issuance of a warrant may be applied against the same tax concurrently, each unaffected by the others, up to their combined maximum rates; • application of the penalties imposed for the late payment of a return, unregistered taxpayer, assessment, and issuance of a warrant, or any combination of these penalties does not prohibit or restrict the application of other penalties authorized by law; Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-228(6)(a); Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.090(7). • the Department of Revenue may impose either the evasion penalty or the penalty for disregarding specific written instructions, but may not impose both penalties on the same tax; and • the penalty for the misuse of a resale certificate or reseller permit cannot be applied in combination with either the evasion penalty or the penalty for disregarding specific written instructions on the same tax. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-228(6)(b); Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.090(8). Disaster Relief Businesses affected by the 2015 windstorms and flooding can ask the Washington Department of Revenue for more time to file and pay taxes, request a waiver of late payment penalties, request extensions for expiring permits, licenses or registrations, and reschedule an audit. See Washington Dept. of Rev., Relief for Businesses, Property Owners Affected By Wind and Flooding. BNA-SUTN WA 31.12.1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Criminal Penalties

Yes The Washington State Department of Revenue may impose both fines, imprisonment or both fines and imprisonment, for criminal violations of the rules and regulations relating to sales and use taxes. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.290(1)(a), as amended by 2013 Wash. S.B. 5715, effective July 28, 2013. Those penalties that result in a gross misdemeanor include:• engaging in business without having obtained a certificate of registration; • for the president, vice president, secretary, treasurer , or other officer of any company to cause or permit the company to engage in business without having obtained a certificate of registration; • for any person to tear down or remove any order or notice posted by the Department of Revenue; • for any person to aid or abet another in any attempt to evade the payment of any tax; • for any purchaser to fraudulently sign or furnish to a seller documentation authorized under Wash. Rev. Code §82.04.470 without intent to resell the property purchased or with intent to use the property in a manner inconsistent with the claimed wholesale purchase;or • for any person to fail or refuse to permit the examination of any book, paper, account, record, or other data or the inspection or appraisal of any property by the Department of Revenue or its duly authorized agent; or to refuse to offer testimony or produce any record as required. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.290(1)(a), as amended by 2013 Wash. S.B. 5715, effective July 28, 2013. Actions that result in a C class felony include:• effective July 28, 2013, the knowing sale, purchase, installation, transfer, manufacture, possession, or use of an automated sales suppression device designed to falsify the records of an electronic cash register or other point of sale system. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.290(4)(a), as amended by 2013 Wash. S.B. 5715, effective July 28, 2013. A violation results in a fine in amount equal to the greater of $10,000, the defendant's gain from the commission of the crime, or the state's loss from the commission of the crime. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.290(4)(c)(ii), as amended by 2013 Wash. S.B. 5715, effective July 28, 2013. BNA-SUTN WA 31.12.2.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Waiver of Penalties

Yes Washington will waive penalties if a failure to pay tax owed or underpayment of tax is due to circumstances beyond the control of the taxpayer. Circumstances beyond the control of the taxpayer are generally those that immediate, unexpected, or in the nature of an emergency. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.105(1); Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-228(9). These circumstances include a delinquency directly caused by the death or serious injury of the taxpayer or a member of their immediate family which precludes the taxpayer from having reasonable time to obtain an extension or otherwise arrange timely filing and payment. Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 17-0269 (Nov. 3, 2017) (family illness not a qualifying circumstance when it occurred before the assessment at issue). Penalties will be waived in cases where payment was mailed on time but inadvertently sent to another agency. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-228(9)(a)(ii)(A); see Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0109 (March 31, 2016). Reliance on oral advice of a Department employee is generally not considered to constitute circumstances beyond the taxpayer's control. Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0305 (Jan. 31, 2016) (taxpayer argued that an employee mentioned that a penalty waiver would not be an issue and that penalties and interest should be waived; however, reliance on oral advice is not covered by statute or department guidance); see Washington Excise Tax Advisory 3065-2009 (Feb. 2, 2009) (describing when penalties may be waived because of reliance on oral instructions by a department employee); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 17–0151 (June 14, 2017) (stating “Washington does not permit the waiver of tax when the alleged advice is oral”). Past compliance with tax laws is not a basis for waiving the substantial underpayment penalty imposed under Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.090(2). Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.090(2); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 14-0276 (March 31, 2016). See also Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 17-0075 (Dec. 29, 2017) (additional 10 percent assessment penalty, for failure to timely pay the amount due, was abated because taxpayer timely filed a request for a waiver). Waiver in Cases of Fraud When requesting a penalty waiver in cases involving fraud, taxpayers bear the burden of proving four things by a preponderance of evidence:• that the alleged criminal act must have actually occurred; • that the alleged criminal act must have caused the late payment or assessment of the underlying tax; • that the act of fraud, embezzlement or theft was of a nature that could not be immediately detected or prevented; and • that the taxpayer had reasonable safeguards or internal controls in place to detect or prevent acts of fraud, embezzlement or theft. Statements and allegations alone are insufficient to show that fraud occurred. Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 18-0135 (May 16, 2018) (refusing to overturn evasion penalties assessed against taxpayer despite claims of fraud committed by CPA because taxpayer did not prove that CPA engaged in a criminal act which caused their delinquency, that the act was not immediately detectable or preventable, or that it had reasonable safeguards or internal controls in place to prevent the act); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 18-0138 (May 16, 2017) (finding that a taxpayer's small claims filing against a former employee accountant was insufficient evidence of fraud and also finding a lack of reasonable safeguards or internal controls, when the taxpayer repeatedly relied on bare assurances from the employee that returns had been filed, despite repeated calls and notices from the department of revenue stating otherwise); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 14-0387 (Dec. 31, 2015) (taxpayer's allegations without other supporting documentation, such as police reports or statements, was not enough to show that an employee's ignoring of department communications regarding an audit and assessments due amounted to fraud instead of mere misconduct;thus, the taxpayer's request for a penalty waiver was denied); Washington Tax Decision Det. No. 15-0283 (Dec. 31, 2015) (taxpayer did not present evidence that internal safeguards were in place that would have revealed an employee's embezzlement of funds that caused the underpayment of taxes; the substantial underpayment penalty was not waived).

Topic: Administration and Procedure Interest Overpayment Rates Calculation

Federal short-term rate + 2% The interest rate on overpayments is the same as the rate on underpayments, which is determined by adding two percentage points to the average of the federal short-term rates from January, April, and July of the immediately preceding calendar year and October of the previous preceding calendar year. Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.50(2); Wash. Rev. Code §82.32.60(4); Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-228(7); see 26 U.S.C. §1274(d). If the taxpayer made all overpayments for each calendar year and all reporting periods ending with the final month are included in a credit notice or refund on or before the due date of the final return for each calendar year or the final reporting period included in the notice or refund, interest is computed from either:• January 31st following each calendar year included in a notice or refund; or • the last day of the month following the final month included in a notice or refund. Wash. Admin. Code §458-20-229(8)(c). If the taxpayer did not make all overpayments for each calendar year and all reporting periods ending with the final month included in the notice or refund, interest is computed from the last day of the month following the date on which payment in full of the liabilities was made for each calendar year included in a notice or refund, and the last day of the month following the date on which payment in full of the liabilities was made if the final month included in a notice or refund is not the end of a calendar year.
