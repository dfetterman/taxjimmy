Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.84(1)(b). Leases or Rentals Leases and rentals of motor vehicles, trailers, semitrailers, and aircraft, not constituting “transportation equipment”, that require only one payment, are sourced to the location where the lessee receives the property. This is generally the lessor or dealer's location. Wis. Stat. §77.522(3)(b); Wisconsin News for Tax Professionals – Oct. 31, 2014. Leases and rentals of motor vehicles, trailers, semitrailers, and aircraft, not constituting “transportation equipment”, that require multiple payments are sourced to the primary location of such motor vehicles, trailers, semitrailers, or aircraft as indicated by an address for the property that is provided by the lessee and that is available in records that the lessor maintains in the ordinary course of the lessor's business. Wis. Stat. §77.522(3)(b). If the lease for a motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, or aircraft calls for multiple payments, but the lessee chooses to pay in a single payment, the one payment sourcing rule does not apply and the lease is sourced to the primary location of the motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, or aircraft.

Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Motor Vehicles, Intrastate or Non-Commercial Use Purchase, Lease, or Rental Transactions

Taxable Motor vehicles are subject to sales tax in Wisconsin. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.83(2); Wisconsin Publication 202. The Wisconsin Department of Transportation is required to collect use tax along with titling and registration fees if no exemption applies. Wisconsin Tax Bulletin No. 197. Motor Vehicle Leases Wisconsin treats lease payments related to motor vehicles as a series of recurring monthly sales to the lessee, which are subject to sales and use taxes. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.29(1); Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.79(1). Fees associated with motor vehicle leasing are taxable. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.79(4)(a). Fees associated with motor vehicle leases include security deposits, document fees, tire fees, and cash down payments. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.79(4)(a). Wisconsin treats a lease's exercised purchase option price as a separate taxable transaction. A Terminal Rental Adjustment Clause (TRAC) provides for a preset purchase option price. Parties often use TRACs when leasing over-the-road equipment, like semi-trucks and tractor trailers. The advantage to a TRAC is that it allows both parties to control for depreciation costs, which can vary substantially depending on use. The parties need not estimate the depreciation and amortize it over the life of the lease. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.79(4)(a). Wisconsin treats agreements with TRACs as leases, consistent with I.R.C. §7701(h)(1), which stipulates that if an agreement otherwise conforms with the definition of a lease, and if the lessee is never treated as the owner during the course of the lease term, then the agreement should be treated as a lease, the TRAC notwithstanding. Wis. Stat. §77.51(7)(a); Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.29(1). A lease does not include a transfer of possession or control of tangible personal property under an agreement requiring transfer of title upon completion of the required payments and payment of an option price does not exceed the greater of $100 or 1 percent of the total required payments. Wis. Stat. §77.51(7)(b)(2). As a result, the sales tax on a finance lease, which is a type of agreement that typically meets the above definition, would be due up-front instead of on a monthly basis. Wis. Stat. §77.61(1)(b). Sourcing: The Wisconsin Department of Revenue provides guidance to explain that when determining where an automobile lease occurs, there are different results for one-payment leases and multiple-payment leases. The guidance explains that if there is only one lease payment, then the lease takes place where the customer receives the automobile (typically, the lessor or dealer's location). In contrast, if there are multiple lease payments, then the lease takes place where the lessee will customarily keep the automobile(typically, the vehicle's primary location based on the address provided by the lessee to the lessor). Wis. Stat. §77.522(3)(b); Wisconsin News for Tax Professionals – March 3, 2016. If the lease for a motor vehicle calls for multiple payments, but the lessee chooses to pay in a single payment, the one payment sourcing rule does not apply and the lease is sourced to the primary location of the motor vehicle. Wisconsin 2016 Tax Practitioner Questions and Answers. Commercial Radio and Television Station Vehicles Effective July 1, 2014, Wisconsin exempts from sales and use tax qualified purchases by licensed commercial radio or television stations in Wisconsin. To qualify for the exemption, the property must meet four criteria. Namely, the tangible personal property must be used [1] exclusively and [2] directly [3] to originate or integrate various sources of program material for commercial radio or television transmissions that are [4] generally available to the public free of charge without a subscription or service agreement. Wis. Stat. §77.54(23n), as enacted by 2013 Wis. A.B. 5, effective July 1, 2014; see also Wisconsin Publication 247 (explaining the “new exemption for certain radio and television stations”). Regarding motor vehicles, agency guidance explains that satellite and microwave trucks generally qualify for exemption. Equipment on those trucks (e.g., transmitters and satellite dishes) also qualify because the equipment is used to originate a signal and send it to the radio or television station for use in the origination and integration of the program material. Other motor vehicles might qualify, too. Wisconsin Publication 247. Taxis Leased to Drivers A taxicab company may hire drivers as employees or independent contractors. If a taxicab company leases its taxis to its drivers, the lease receipts are subject to Wisconsin sales or use tax.
