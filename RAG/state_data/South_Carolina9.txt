Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

True Object South Carolina law uses the true object test to distinguish sales of services from sales of tangible personal property. See e.g., South Carolina Private Letter Ruling PLR No. 13-2 (April 16, 2013). If the true object of the transaction is the purchase of tangible personal property or taxable services, then the entire transaction is subject to tax. South Carolina Private Letter Ruling PLR No. 13-2 (April 16, 2013); South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 11-2 (Sept. 1, 2011), superseding South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 05-13 (Oct. 1, 2005); see also South Carolina Administrative Law Court Decision, No. 13-ALJ-17-0218-CC (Jan. 6, 2014), aff'd, Boggero v. South Carolina Dept. of Rev., 777 S.E.2d 842 (S.C. Ct. App. 2015) (administrative law judge applied the true object test to determine that taxpayer's sales were for the rental of tangible personal property, i.e., portable toilets, not for providing nontaxable waste removal and disposal services). However, if the true object of the transaction is to acquire a non-taxable service, and tangible personal property is received incidental to the service, then the entire charge is exempt from tax. South Carolina Private Letter Ruling PLR No. 13-2 (April 16, 2013); South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 11-2 (Sept. 1, 2011), superseding South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 05-13 (Oct. 1, 2005); see also South Carolina Administrative Law Court Decision No. 09-ALJ-17-0089-CC (May 19, 2010) (charges to customer of catering business for service, room, and labor should be included in gross proceeds of sales for sales tax purposes because charges are incidental to sale of tangible personal property; applying true object test, main purpose of contract between caterer and buyer is purchase food and beverages, even though catered meals are product of special skills and knowledge of caterer, which may contribute to preparation and presentation); Meyers Arnold, Inc. v. South Carolina Tax Comn., 328 S.E.2d 920, 923 (S.C. Ct. App. 1985) (elements of service involved in layaway sale was subject to tax as incidental to sale of tangible personal property); Regency Towers Assn., Inc. v. South Carolina Tax Comn., 1989 BL 854 (S.C. Ct. Com. Pl. 1989) (charges for maid service were not deductible from gross proceeds derived from charges for accommodations); South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 93-6 (July 1, 1993) (quoting previous decision stating that charges for engraving service, even though optional, were part of sale of plaques and trophies and subject to tax as part of vendors gross proceeds from sales).

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Bundled Transactions

Taxable Telecommunication services sold in a bundled transaction for a lump sum are subject to sales or use tax. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-910(B)(3)(b)(ii). A bundled transaction is a transaction consisting of distinct and identifiable properties or services that are sold for one non-itemized price, but are treated differently for tax purposes. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1310(B)(3)(b)(i); S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1310(B)(3)(b)(ii); South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 17-2 (March 10, 2017), superseding South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 06-8 (Nov. 16, 2006). Thus, even though the transaction involves the sale of exempt services, such services are taxable when sold “bundled”with taxable services. However, the nontaxable property may be treated as nontaxable if the telecommunications service provider can reasonably identify the nontaxable portion of the charge from the books and records that the provider keeps in the regular course of business for purposes other than sales taxes. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-910(B)(3)(b)(ii); S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1310(B)(3)(b)(ii); South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 17-2 (March 10, 2017), superseding South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 06-8 (Nov. 16, 2006). BNA-SUTN SC 9.3.2.
