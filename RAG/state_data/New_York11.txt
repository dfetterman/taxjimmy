Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Local Option Sales and Use Tax

Local Tax Authorized New York law authorizes cities and counties to impose local sales and use taxes in one of two ways. N.Y. Tax Law §1107(a); N.Y. Tax Law §1108(a); see N.Y. Tax Law §1210(iv)(a), as amended by 2019 N.Y. A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019; see also N.Y. Tax Law §1210(iv)(b), as amended by 2019 N.Y. A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019; New York Publication 718-A. The first method is to enact all of the taxes, exemptions, and provisions (other than the rate of tax), described in the state sales and use tax statutes, with some differences. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(iv)(a)(1), as amended by 2019 N.Y. A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019. However, any local sales and use tax ordinance enacted by a city of less than one million people or by a county or school district must exempt from tax all sales of tangible personal property used or consumed directly and predominantly in the production of tangible personal property, gas, electricity, refrigeration, or steam for sale by manufacturing, processing, generating, assembling, refining, mining, or extracting. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(iv)(a)(1)(i), as amended by 2019 N.Y. A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019. Further, these localities must also exempt all sales of tangible personal property for use or consumption predominantly in either the production of tangible personal property for sale by farming or in a commercial horse-boarding operation. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(iv)(a)(1)(i), as amended by 2019 N.Y. A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019. In addition, all cities, counties, and school districts imposing local sales and use taxes may, in their discretion, provide the state level exemptions from sales and use tax for residential solar energy systems equipment and clothing and footwear at the local level. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(iv)(a)(1)(ii), as amended by 2019 N.Y. A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019. For example, beginning June 1, 2014, Erie County no longer charges tax on the installation of residential solar energy systems. New York Publication 718-CS. The second method by which cities and counties may impose local sales and use taxes is to enact only a portion of the taxes imposed under the state level provisions. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(iv)(b)(1), as amended by 2019 N.Y. A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019. Any local taxes that are enacted must include the same corresponding provisions as the state sales and compensating use tax. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(iv)(b)(2), as amended by 2019 N.Y. A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019. The localities may enact taxes on some or all of the following:• The retail sale of gas, electricity, refrigeration, and steam and services related to these items. If sales tax is imposed on gas and electricity, then a use tax must be imposed on gas and electricity. N.Y. Tax Law §1105(b)(1)(A); N.Y. Tax Law §1110(a)(H); N.Y. Tax Law §1210(iv)(b)(1), as amended by 2019 N.Y. A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019. • The retail sale of telephony, telegraphy, telephone, telephone and telegraph services of whatever nature except interstate and international telephony and telephone and telegraph service, and intrastate mobile telecommunications services of whatever nature in any state if the mobile telecommunications customer's place of primary use is in New York.

Tax Law §1210(iv)(b)(1), as amended by 2019 N.Y. A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019. • The retail sale of prepaid telephone calling services. If sales of prepaid telephone calling services are taxed, a complementary use tax must also be imposed. N.Y. Tax Law §1105(b)(1)(D); N.Y. Tax Law §1110(a)(G); N.Y. Tax Law §1210(iv)(b)(1), as amended by 2019 N.Y.

Tax Law §1105(f)(1); N.Y. Tax Law §1210(iv)(b)(1), as amended by 2019 N.Y. A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019. Sales of motor or diesel motor fuel that is sold at a retail gas station for exclusive use in a motor vehicle may be subject to local sales or use tax. While most localities impose the tax using the percentage rate method, Seneca County imposes the tax using the cents-per-gallon method of computing local tax due.New York Publication 718-F provides a listing of local sales and use tax rates on qualified motor fuel, highway diesel motor fuel, and B20 biodiesel. New York Publication 718-F; see also New York Notice N-17-1 (Feb. 2017). Lastly, certain counties are authorized to enact an additional tax if they withdraw from the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(iv), as amended by 2019 N.Y. A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019. The local laws must be identical to the state laws including definitions and exemptions. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(iv)(a)(1), as amended by 2019 N.Y.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Sale' and 'Retail Sale'

Defined New York defines the term “sale, selling, or purchase” as any: transfer of title, possession, or both; exchange or barter; rental, lease, or license to use or consume (or, for computer software, merely the right to reproduce); or agreement for the aforementioned involving consideration, including rendering a taxable service for consideration. N.Y. Tax Law §1101(b)(5); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §526.7(a). “Consideration” is defined as monetary consideration, exchange, barter, the rendering of any service, or any agreement thereof, including the assumption of liabilities, fees, rentals, royalties or any other charge that a purchaser, lessee, or licensee is required to pay. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §526.7(b); see In re CLM Assocs., LLC, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 826735 (Feb. 23, 2017) (although no funds were exchanged in intercompany transfer of title to motor vehicles used as loaner cars from group of commonly owned dealerships to a related company, the consideration provided included related company's acceptance of liability for vehicle accidents and assumption of joint-and-several responsibility for financing for vehicles, thus, the transfers constituted taxable sales), aff'd in part, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 826735 (Feb. 12, 2018). New York defines the term “retail sale” as any sale of tangible personal property to any person for any purpose other than:• for resale; • as a physical component of tangible personal property; • for use by the purchaser in performing taxable services, and where sold property becomes a physical component part of the property upon which the services are performed; or • where the sold property is later transferred to the purchaser of the service in conjunction with the performance of the service. N.Y. Tax Law §1101(b)(4); N.Y. Tax Law §1101(b)(5); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §525.2; N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §526.3; N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §526.6. A “retail sale” specifically includes:• a sale of tangible personal property to a contractor or subcontractor for use in erecting, adding to or altering buildings or maintaining, servicing or repairing real property regardless of whether it is resold; N.Y. Tax Law §1101(b)(4)(I); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §526.6(b)(1). • a sale of tangible personal property for use on domesticated animals or poultry when sold to a veterinarian notwithstanding subsequent sale; N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §526.6(b)(2). • a sale of tangible personal property to a mortician, undertaker, or funeral director for use in conducting funerals; N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §526.6(b)(3). and • the sale of motor fuel and diesel motor fuel, notwithstanding the subsequent sale of such fuel to the ultimate consumer. N.Y. Tax Law §1101(b)(4)(ii); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §526.6(b)(4). To enhance the enforcement of the sales tax on motor fuel sold in the state, in 1985 the Legislature enacted N.Y. Tax Law §1102 and modified §1101(b)(4)(ii) to change the payment structure of the sales and use tax on the retail sale of gasoline. Under these provisions, distributors of motor fuel and diesel fuel must prepay the sales tax due on each gallon of fuel imported into the state. The effect of the new regime was to eliminate tax-free sales for resales among distributors, substituting instead a “pre-collection” regime. See N.Y. Tax Law §1102. Services as Sales Moreover, the rendering of any specifically enumerated taxable service for consideration is a “sale.” N.Y. Tax Law §1101(b)(5); N.Y. Tax Law §1105(c) (enumerating taxable services); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §526.7(a)(4). BNA-SUTN NY 1.4.1.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Lease'

Defined The terms “rental,” “lease,” and “license to use” all refer to transaction in which there is a transfer of the possession of tangible personal property for consideration without the transfer of title to the property. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §526.7(c). “Lease” is included within the definitions of the words “sale,” “selling,”and “purchase.” N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §526.7(a)(2). BNA-SUTN NY 1.4.2.

==================================================

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Use' or 'Storage, Use, or Consumption'

Defined New York defines “use” as the exercise of any right or power over tangible personal property or over any taxable service under New York state or local law. N.Y. Tax Law §1101(b)(7). This includes activities such as:• receiving; • storing, keeping, or retaining for any length of time; • withdrawing from storage; • installing or affixing to real or personal property; • consuming;and • distributing promotional materials. N.Y. Tax Law §1101(b)(7). New York provides detailed guidance to explain what the use tax is and to provide examples of when it applies. New York TB-ST-913 (Jan. 18, 2017). The guidance explains that the use tax is a tax imposed on taxable items or services used in New York when the sales tax has not been paid. Thus, if a seller does not collect sales tax on a taxable sale to a New York resident, or if a New York resident uses taxable items or services in New York following a taxable transaction on which she has not paid sales tax, then the purchaser owes use tax and must report it directly to the department. New York TB-ST-913 (Jan. 18, 2017); see, e.g., In re Groman, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 824274 (Dec. 4, 2014) (New York resident “used”yacht in New York for sales and use tax purposes by purchasing it in Florida and then causing it to sail north into New York waters). But see In re Pellino, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 825869 (Oct. 1, 2015) (during taxpayer's decade-long yacht ownership, taxpayer did not “use”yacht for New York use tax purposes by stopping it in New York on two occasions for one night each while in transit from North Carolina to Connecticut; the vessel's temporary physical presence was a transient “stopover”rather than a taxable use). These cases resulted from auditors checking marinas and docks for vessels with out-of-state registrations and sending inquiries to the registered owners. For many years New York has had an active audit program examining customs declarations of New York residents returning from trips overseas and asserting use tax on the taxable purchases. In re Scher, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 819844 (June 2, 2005). Materials Used to Construct Buildings in New York The New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division has held that use tax does not apply to materials purchased and processed into building components outside the state and used to construct buildings within New York. In Morton Bldgs., Inc. v. Chu, the taxpayer, an Illinois company, sold and erected pre-fabricated buildings for use in New York and other states. The taxpayer purchased raw materials outside of New York and made them into building components at factories located outside of New York. When a customer ordered a building, the taxpayer withdrew the necessary raw materials from storage (e.g., lumber, nails, cement, staples, insulation, and plastic sheeting) and made them into building components. The taxpayer sought a refund of all use taxes it paid to New York to buy the raw materials used at its out-of-state factories to make building components used in New York. The taxpayer argued that the raw materials in issue were not “purchased from a retailer” because the building components constructed from the raw materials were new and different tangible personal property. Morton Bldgs., Inc. v. Chu, 126 A.D.2d 828 (N.Y. App. Div. 1987) aff'd, 513 N.E.2d 1304 (N.Y. 1987). In its analysis, the Appellate Division applied the following test to determine if imposing use tax on the raw materials was proper:• the item of tangible personal property must be used, stored, or consumed in New York; or • the item of tangible personal property must be purchased from a retailer(not manufactured by the user). Morton Bldgs., Inc. v. Chu, 126 A.D.2d 828 (N.Y. App. Div. 1987) aff'd, 513 N.E.2d 1304 (N.Y. 1987). The Appellate Division held that the manufacturing process performed on the raw materials transformed them into something that was not purchased from a retailer. As a result, converting raw materials into identifiably distinguishable personal property excludes the raw materials from continued taxability under the use tax. Morton Bldgs., Inc. v. Chu, 126 A.D.2d 828 (N.Y. App. Div. 1987) aff'd, 513 N.E.2d 1304 (N.Y. 1987). BNA-SUTN NY 1.4.3.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Key Definitions 'Tangible Personal Property'

Defined New York defines “tangible personal property” as corporeal personal property of any nature having a material existence and perceptibility to the human senses. N.Y. Tax Law § 1101(b)(6). “Tangible personal property” includes:• raw materials (e.g., wood, metal, rubber, minerals); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, § 526.8(a)(1). • manufactured items(e.g., gasoline, oil, chemicals, jewelry, furniture, machinery, clothing, vehicles, appliances, lighting fixtures, building materials); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, § 526.8(a)(2). • artistic items (e.g., sketches, paintings, photographs, moving picture films, recordings); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, § 526.8(a)(3). • animals, trees, shrubs, plants and seeds; N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, § 526.8(a)(4). • water; N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, § 526.8(a)(5). • coins and other numismatic items, when purchased for purposes other than for use as a medium of exchange; N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, § 526.8(a)(6). • postage stamps, when purchased for purposes other than mailing; N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, § 526.8(a)(7). • precious metals in the form of bullion, ingots, wafers, and other forms; N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, § 526.8(a)(8). • pre-written computer software, whether sold as part of a package, as a separate component, or otherwise, and regardless of the medium by means of which the software is conveyed to a purchaser; N.Y. Tax Law § 1101(b)(6). and • newspapers and periodicals where the vendor ships or delivers the entire edition or issue of the newspaper or periodical, with or without the advertising included in the paper edition or issue. N.Y. Tax Law § 1101(b)(6). However, this does not include anything, other than advertising, that is not included in the paper edition or issue, in which delivery is by means of telephony, telegraphy, or other electronic media. But, where the amount of the sales or subscription price, including any charge by the vendor for shipping or delivery to the purchaser, is separately stated to such purchaser, that amount is subject to sales tax. New York does not consider gas, electricity, refrigeration, and steam to be tangible personal property for the purpose of the tax imposed on utility services. However, New York does consider gas to be tangible personal property if sold in containers or in bulk for purposes other than heating, cooking or lighting. N.Y. Tax Law § 1101(b)(6); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, § 526.8(b); see also New York TSB-A-15(23)S (May 26, 2015) (explaining the rule while analyzing whether a propane gas recovery service was subject to New York sales tax); New York TSB-A-07(25)S (Aug. 29, 2007). In New York, real property and intangible personal property are not tangible personal property. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, § 526.8(c)(1) (real property); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, § 526.8(c)(2) (intangible personal property). If a taxpayer purchases tangible personal property and later annexes it to or causes it to become real property, New York nevertheless considers the property to be tangible personal property at the time of sale. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, § 526.8(d). A modular home that is permanently affixed to real property is not tangible personal property. But if a modular home is to be removed from the realty, whether as a whole or disassembled, it and its component parts are tangible personal property, whether it is to be sold as a whole or as pieces. N.Y. Tax Law § 1101(b)(6). BNA-SUTN NY 1.4.4.

The term “vendor”also includes such sellers that:• maintain a place of business in the state and make sales to persons within the state; • solicit business by employees, independent contractors, agents, or other representatives or by distribution of catalogs or other advertising matter, without regard to whether such distribution is the result of regular or systematic solicitation, if such person has nexus with the state; • regularly or systematically deliver such property or services in the state by means other than the U.S. mail or common carrier; • regularly or systematically solicit business in New York by the distribution, without regard to the location from which such distribution originated, of catalogs, advertising flyers or letters, or by any other means of solicitation of business, to people in New York, if such solicitation satisfies nexus; • retain an ownership interest in such property and where such property is brought into New York by the person to whom such property is sold and the person to whom such property is sold becomes or is a resident or uses such property in any manner in carrying on any employment, trade, business, or profession in New York; • make sales to persons who may be authorized by the tax commissioner to collect such tax; • are any agencies, instrumentalities, public corporations, or political subdivisions of New York when such entity sells services or property of a kind ordinarily sold by private persons; or • have a New York affiliate that: (i) is a vendor that uses in the state trademarks, service marks, or trade names that are the same as those the seller uses; or (ii) that engages in activities in the state that inure to the benefit of the seller, in its development or maintenance of a market for its goods or services in the state, to the extent that the affiliate's activities meet the nexus requirement. N.Y. Tax Law § 1101(b)(8)(i). In addition, the commissioner may determine that an agent is jointly responsible for collecting and remitting sales tax alongside the vendor. N.Y.
