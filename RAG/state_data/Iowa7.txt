Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Other Food-Related Transactions

Nontaxable Food Delivery Food delivery services are not subject to sales and use tax. However, sales tax must be paid on the cost of the food delivered. Iowa Revenue Policy Letter No. 16300057 (Aug. 25, 2016). Universities and Fraternities The taxability of food sales to fraternities (non-profit organizations) depends largely on whether the food is prepared at the time of sale. If a food vendor sells unprepared food ingredients to a fraternity, the transaction is exempt from tax. If the food is prepared, the transaction is subject to tax. Iowa Code Ann. §423.3(57); Iowa Revenue Policy Letter No. 16300056 (Aug. 11, 2016). Alternatively, if a fraternity provides the food ingredients and an outside party prepares the meals, the transaction is not subject to tax because the service of preparing food is not taxable. Whether or not food ingredients, products, and preparation services are separately itemized, the food preparation services remain tax-exempt. However, the food sold is still taxable. Iowa Code Ann. §423.3(57); Iowa Revenue Policy Letter No. 16300056 (Aug. 11, 2016). BNA-SUTN IA 11.10.
