Effective July 1, 2017, motor vehicles that will be registered with the South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles are subject to the Infrastructure Maintenance Fee imposed by S.C. Code Ann. §56-3-627 and are exempt from state and local sales and use taxes. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-2110(A), as amended by 2017 S.C.

The fee is 5 percent of the gross proceeds of sale of the purchase or lease up to a maximum of$500. Owners of vehicles which were first registered in another state but are subsequently registered in South Carolina are required to pay a fee of $250. South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 18-1 (March 5, 2018), superseding South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 10-6 (March 23, 2010), and South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 05-4 (April 5, 2005). Effective July 1, 2017, sales or leases of vehicles that are not subject to the Infrastructure Maintenance Fee imposed by S.C. Code Ann. §56-3-627, such as a utility trailer for personal use, are subject to sales and use taxes at a rate of 5 percent up to a $500 maximum. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-2110(A), as amended by 2017 S.C.

Sales and leases subject to a maximum sales and use tax pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-2110, such as water vessels, are exempt from the “additional sales, use and casual excise tax” that applies to most sales. Therefore, the effective rate on the sale of water vessels is 5 percent. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-1110; S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-2110. This includes local sales and use taxes administered by the department. South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 18-11 (June 7, 2018), superseding South Carolina Revenue Ruling No. 08-7 (June 30, 2008).

South Carolina law exempts from sales tax vessels and barges of more than 50 tons burden. S.C. Code Ann. §12-36-2120(21). The terms “watercraft” and “vessel”include anything used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on the water but does not include: a seaplane regulated by the federal government, water skis, aquaplanes, surfboards, windsurfers, tubes, rafts, and similar devices or anything that does not meet construction or operational requirements of the state or federal government for watercraft. S.C. Code Ann. §50-21-10(28).

This definition is not provided in South Carolina's sales and use tax statutes, but the Department of Revenue relies on statutory definition for motor vehicles that are also found outside the sales and use tax laws, and it is likely the same policy will apply for water vessels.
