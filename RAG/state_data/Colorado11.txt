Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Local Option Sales and Use Tax

Local Tax Authorized Cities, counties, and special districts are authorized to levy sales and use taxes upon approval by a majority of the registered electors of the county voting on such a proposal. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-103(1). Colorado has two types of local taxing jurisdictions: state-administered jurisdictions and home rule jurisdictions. State-administered jurisdictions are those jurisdictions, including counties, cities, and special taxing districts, that the Colorado legislature has authorized by statute to impose a sales and use tax, that is administered by the Colorado Department of Revenue. Colorado FYI General 5;Colorado Dept. of Rev., Form DR 1002 Colorado Sales/Use Tax Rates. Home rule jurisdictions are municipalities organized under article XX of the Colorado state constitution. This constitutional provision allows home rule jurisdictions to impose, administer, or enforce any local sales and use tax without being affected or limited by acts of the Colorado state legislature, except for those acts specifically dealing with home rule jurisdictions. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-107(1). State-Administered Colorado laws authorize any county to impose a sales and use tax on certain transactions that occur within their jurisdictional boundaries. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-103(1); Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-103(2). However, the use tax is only permitted to be imposed on motor vehicles registered within their borders, as well as construction and building materials purchased or transported into the jurisdiction. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-109(1); Colorado FYI Sales 62. Additionally, it authorizes any incorporated city or town to impose a sales and use tax, if the county that encompasses that city has not enacted a county sales and use tax. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-102(2). However, incorporated cities and towns located in multiple counties or which have been incorporated within five years of the county imposing a sales and use tax statute may still impose their own sales and use tax statutes. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-103(2); Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-102(2)(b). The sales and use tax rates vary among the state administered taxing jurisdictions. Colorado Dept. of Rev., Form DR 1002 Colorado Sales/Use Tax Rates. The responsibility of administering and collecting such a tax lies with the executive director of the state department of revenue. The executive director of the state department of revenue will collect the tax in the same manner as the collection, administration, and enforcement of the Colorado state sales tax. Upon collection, the executive director of the state department of revenue will distribute the revenue due to each county. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-106(1)-(3); Colorado FYI General 5. In addition to the local sales and use tax, state-administered localities may enact the taxes discussed below. Sales Tax for Mental Health Care Services Colorado law allows for each state administered county to levy and collect a county sales tax for the purpose of providing mental health care services to residents of the county who are in need of mental health care services and to family members of those individuals. The county may use the revenue raised to provide health care services either directly or indirectly. The tax may be imposed at a rate not to exceed 0.25 percent on the total charge made for the sale of tangible personal property within the county. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-103.9. County Tax for Public Safety Improvements Colorado law provides that the county commissioners of each county may levy a sales tax for public safety improvements. The tax may not be levied at a rate of more than 2 percent on the total charge made for the sale of tangible personal property within the county. The net revenues raised from this tax, less the cost of collection, administration, and enforcement paid to the department of revenue must be used by the county for public safety improvements. For the purpose of this tax, a public safety improvement is any capital expenditure or cost associated with a public safety organization. Colo. Rev. Stat. §30-11-107.9. Effective May 24, 2017, proposals for such a tax must be submitted to the registered electors at the next general election, the next biennial county election, or the next election held on the first Tuesday of November in an odd-numbered year as a determined by the Board of County Commissioners. Colo. Rev. Stat. §30-11-107.9, amended by 2017 Colo. H.B. 1342, effective May 24, 2017. Prior to May 24, 2017, such proposals must be submitted to the registered electors of the county at the next general election. Colo. Rev. Stat. §30-11-107.9. Special Taxes for Water Rights Colorado law allows state administered counties to levy and collect a county sales and use tax for the purpose of purchasing, adjudicating changes of, leasing, using, banking, and selling water rights used by the county. The tax may not be levied at a rate of more than one percent of the total purchase price. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-103.7. Sales Tax for Health Care Services Colorado law provides that all state administered counties may levy and collect a county sales tax, upon voter approval, for the purpose of providing health care services to those residents of the county who are in need of health care services. The county may use the revenue raised to provide health care services either directly or indirectly. Colo. Rev. Stat. §29-2-103.8. State-Administered Special Districts In addition to the counties and cities discussed above, Colorado law allows for the creation of special state-administered taxing districts. The special taxing districts, are statutorily defined areas in Colorado composed of multiple municipalities or counties that have received authority to impose their own sales and use tax. The revenue raised from these taxes is used for a specified purpose. Colorado FYI General 5; Colo. Rev. Stat. §32-1-1001.
