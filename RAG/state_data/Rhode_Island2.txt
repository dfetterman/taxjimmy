Generally, Rhode Island requires most taxpayers to file sales and use tax returns on a monthly basis. R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-61.5, replacing R.I. Regs. SU 89-94, effective Aug. 3, 2018. However, taxpayers may have the option to file on a quarterly basis. R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-61.5, replacing R.I. Regs. SU 89-94, effective Aug. 3, 2018. Quarterly Filing: Any qualified taxpayer who is required to file monthly returns under the Rhode Island Sales and Use Tax Act may apply to the Tax Administrator for permission to file a quarterly return and remittance instead of a monthly return. In order for a taxpayer to qualify for quarterly reporting, filing records must substantiate the fact that the taxpayer's sales and use tax liability has averaged less that $200 per month for the past six consecutive months immediately preceding the date of the application. A taxpayer is not permitted to begin making quarterly filings until the taxpayer has received official written permission from the Tax Administrator. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-19-10; R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-61.5, replacing R.I. Regs. SU 89-94, effective Aug. 3, 2018. When a taxpayer's application for permission to file quarterly has been approved, the taxpayer's sales and use tax returns must be filed on or before the last day of July, October, January and April of each year for the preceding three month period. However, there are certain conditions that could cause the Tax Administrator to revoke his authorization for a taxpayer to file quarterly; and in that case the taxpayer would have to return to using the monthly filing schedule. R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-61.5, replacing R.I. Regs. SU 89-94, effective Aug. 3, 2018. The Tax Administrator may, at any time after granting permission to a taxpayer to file quarterly return and remittances, revoke that authorization in the event that:• a taxpayer filing sales and use tax returns on a quarterly basis becomes delinquent in either the filing of the return or the payment of the taxes due; or • the liability of a taxpayer exceeds $600 in sales and use taxes for any quarter; or • the Tax Administrator determines that quarterly filing or return any payment of tax due would unduly jeopardize the proper administration of the Rhode Island Sales and Use Tax Law. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-19-10. Deadlines, Weekends and Holidays If a taxpayer finds that the deadline for performing any act under Rhode Island law falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, the act is considered to be performed in a timely manner if the act is performed on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday. For a taxpayer, this means that filing any return, report, or statement with the Treasury Department on the next day following a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when the filing was due on that Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, is considered to be filed in a timely manner. In this context, the term legal holiday means a legal holiday that is recognized in the State of Rhode Island. R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-00-7.5, replacing R.I. Regs. SU 87-32(A), effective Oct. 3, 2017.

Special Rule for Materialmen:the “Pay When Paid” Option Materialmen may postpone remitting sales tax until they receive payment. Rhode Island refers to this practice as the “pay when paid” method. To use this method, three qualifications must be satisfied, namely that:• the retailer is primarily engaged in selling lumber and building materials to contractors, subcontractors, or repairmen; • at least 50 percent of the retailer's total sales were sales of lumber and building materials to contractors; and • the retailer is authorized under Chapter 28 of Title 34 to file a mechanic's lien on real property for material sold.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Payment Methods Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)

Required for Certain Taxpayers Rhode Island accepts tax payments by electronic funds transfers. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-1-31(c). As of Jan. 1, 2010, any person with an average monthly sales and use tax liability of $200 or more per month for the look back period, must use electronic fund transfer to remit payments to the Division of Taxation. However, any person who has a liability of $10,000 or more in connection with the filing of any return, report or other document with the Division of Taxation is required to remit tax payments for relevant tax type electronically using either the ACH credit or the ACH debit method. R.I. Regs. §EFT 09-01(A) Rule 6. Where a tax required to be paid in connection with the filing of any return, report or other document with the division of taxation exceeds $10,000, the Tax Administrator is authorized to provide as a rule that the payment of any tax is to be accomplished by electronic funds transfer. In all situations where a taxpayer is required to pay employment taxes to the Internal Revenue Service by electronic funds transfer, the taxpayer must also pay Rhode Island income tax withheld by electronic funds transfer. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-1-31(a). Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) means a standard Automated Clearing House (ACH) funds transfer to credit or debit bank account or wire transfer. Electronic fund transfer does not include payments by check, draft or similar paper instrument. R.I. Regs. §EFT 09-01 Rule 5(G). An ACH refers to a central distribution and settlement point for the electronic clearing of debits and credits between financial institutions. An automated clearing house may be a Federal Reserve Bank or any organization with an operating agreement with the North American Clearing House Association (NACHA)that operates as a processing agent for ACH transactions between financial institutions. R.I. Regs. §EFT 09-01 Rule 5(A). “ACH Credit” means an electronic transfer of funds using the ACH network that is originated by a taxpayer through its financial institution to credit (deposit) funds to a designated State of Rhode Island bank account and debit (withdraw) funds from the taxpayer's bank account for a specified payment amount. R.I. Regs. §EFT 09-01(B) Rule 5. “ACH Debit” means an electronic transfer of funds initiated by Rhode Island Division of Taxation, upon taxpayer instruction, to debit a taxpayer's designated bank account and credit funds to a designated State of Rhode Island bank account. R.I. Regs. §EFT 09-01 Rule 5(C). The “Look-back Period” means the previous calendar year used by the Rhode Island Division of Taxation to determine whether EFT thresholds, based on reported tax liability, are met or exceeded. R.I. Regs. §EFT 09-01 Rule 5(H). The Rhode Island Division of Taxation periodically reviews the payment histories of taxpayers, employing the look back period on a tax-specific basis, to determine whether a taxpayer is required to make payments by the EFT method. When the Division of Taxation determines that a person is liable for making payments electronically, the person is notified by the Rhode Island Division of Taxation and provided with the necessary registration forms, or in the case of internet filing the internet address, to establish an EFT account with the Division of Taxation. The taxpayer has 30 days following the date of notification to complete and return registration materials. R.I. Regs. §EFT 09-01 Rule 6(B). Penalty for Non-Compliance Late payments made by EFT are subject to the interest and penalty provisions. EFT deposits to a designated State of Rhode Island bank account that are reversed by the state's depository bank due to insufficient funds in the originator's account are subject to late filing and late payment penalties. R.I. Regs. §EFT 09-01 Rule 8(A). Failure to File Electronically If any person fails to remit taxes by electronic funds transfer or other electronic means as required by the Tax Administrator, the amount of tax required to be electronically transferred is increased by 5 percent of the amount that was not transferred as required or $500, whichever is less, unless there was reasonable cause for the failure and the failure was not due to negligence or willful neglect. R.I. Regs. §EFT 09-01 Rule 8(B). Authority to Waive the Electronic Fund Transfer Mandate A taxpayer may make a written request to the EFT Section for a waiver from mandatory EFT participation on the basis of good cause. Determinations as to whether good cause exists are made on a case-by-case basis. The Tax Administrator generally considers the following situations to constitute good cause:• the taxpayer's bank does not participate in ACH in any form; ○ In order to rely on this factor as a basis for waiver, the taxpayer must provide the Tax Administrator with a letter from its financial institution stating that the institution does not participate in ACH. • the taxpayer's current tax liability and reporting trend shows a decline in the amount of reported tax liability and if the trend is projected into the future, the tax liability will not meet or exceed the applicable mandatory threshold amount; • the taxpayer's tax liability during the look back period no longer meets or exceeds the applicable mandatory threshold amount; • the taxpayer's tax liability meets or exceeds the applicable mandatory threshold amount only because of uncharacteristically high tax amounts reported in three or fewer months of the look back period. However, good cause does not exist for this situation in the case of a person reporting withholding tax on a quarterly basis; • the taxpayer is under the payroll administration of the federal government;and • the taxpayer is required to file three or fewer times per year.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Refunds

Both Rhode Island provides taxpayers desiring a refund of sales and use tax paid must file a written claim for a refund with the tax administrator. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-19-25. Any person who has paid the sales or use tax to the State of Rhode Island and is properly determined to be entitled to a refund, is accordingly refunded that payment from the Rhode Island Treasury. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-19-26. Judicial Review A taxpayer who filed a claim for a refund with the tax administrator of the State of Rhode Island, whose request for a refund was ultimately disallowed, may seek judicial review of the tax commissioner's determination within 30 days from the date that the tax commissioner has notified the claimant that the refund claim was disallowed, in whole or in part. Any person aggrieved by the decision may, within 10 days from the date of the mailing by the tax administrator of notice of the decision, request a hearing and the tax administrator will be required to set a time and place for the hearing as soon as reasonably possible. If, as a result of the hearing, the commissioner's disallowance of the refund is affirmed, the taxpayer may petition the sixth division of the district court for relief from the decision of the tax administrator. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-19-25. An aggrieved party who has exhausted administrative remedies and subsequently filed an exhausted the administrative appeals process with sixth division of the district court, may seek review from the decision of the district court in the supreme court by writ of certiorari in accordance with the procedures contained in R.I. Gen. Laws §42-35-16 R.I. Gen. Laws §44-19-25. . Under Rhode Island law, the Tax Administrator or a court of competent jurisdiction has the authority to determine and issue a refund to a taxpayer entitled to a refund of previously paid sales or use taxes and order that a refund be paid to that taxpayer. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-19-26. In the event that the Tax Administrator or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that a taxpayer is entitled to a refund of any money paid, the Tax Administrator certifies the refund, and the director of administration approves the refund, the general treasurer must pay the refund to the taxpayer from the general treasury. BNA-SUTN RI 31.10.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Statute of Limitations Refund Requests

3 years A claim by a taxpayer for a refund, must be file with the Rhode Island tax administrator within three (3) years from the fifteenth day after the close of the month for which the overpayment was made. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-19-26. A claim for a refund is based upon deficiency determinations made under R.I. Gen. Laws §44-19-11, pecuniary penalties assessed under R.I. Gen. Laws §44-19-12, use tax deficiencies assessed under R.I. Gen. Laws §44-19-13 or estimated tax due assessed under R.I. Gen. Laws §44-19-14 resulting from a taxpayers failure to file a return, the taxpayer may file a claim for a refund within six months from the date of overpayment or within three years from the fifteenth day after the close of the month for which the overpayment was made, whichever period expires later. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-19-26. BNA-SUTN RI 31.11.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Statute of Limitations Assessment of Additional Tax

3 years A notice of the assessment of additional sales tax must be made and mailed to the taxpayer within three years of the later of the 15th day of the calendar month following the month for which the amount is proposed to be determined, or the day the return is filed. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-19-13. This three year statute of limitation applies to returns for sales taxes filed in the state of Rhode Island, except in the case of fraud, an intent to evade the relevant tax provisions, failure to make a return, or a claim for an additional amount is made under to R.I. Gen. Laws §44-19-16 to §44-19-19. The Tax Administrator must give a written notice of the determination to the retailer or the person storing, using, or consuming the tangible personal property. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-19-13. The tax administrator may not, under any circumstances, issue a notice of deficiency determination for any sales or use tax determined to be due and payable more than 10 years after the return is filed or was due to be filed. The tax administrator also may not begin any collection action for any tax that is due and payable unless the action is begun within 10 years after a notice of deficiency determination becomes a final collectible assessment, unless the action is a renewal of a statutory lien that was originally filed within the 10 year period for collection actions. If a taxpayer is in federal bankruptcy or state receivership proceedings, the 10 year periods for deficiency notices and collection actions are both tolled until those proceedings conclude. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-19-13(b), as amended by 2019 R.I. S. 74, effective July 1, 2019. The 10 year limitation does not apply to the renewal or continuation of collection actions concerning liabilities that became final, due, and payable within the 10 year limitation period. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-19-13(c), as amended by 2019 R.I. S. 74, effective July 1, 2019. The Rhode Island Supreme Court has held that there is no limitation period for assessing a sales and use tax deficiency in the event the taxpayer fails to file a return. Couture v. Norberg, 338 A.2d 538 (R.I. 1975). However, the new law imposing a 10 year limitation on such assessments will render this decision moot. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-19-13(b), as amended by 2019 R.I. S. 74, effective July 1, 2019. Use Tax — Statute of Limitations Where a taxpayer who is liable only for use tax files a use tax return monthly, and does not report the correct amount of the use tax due, that filing date sets and begins the running of the statute of limitations, and the assessment for additional tax must be made and the determination mailed to the taxpayer within three years after the date the return is filed. This three year statute of limitation does not apply in the case of fraud or intent to evade the provisions of Rhode Island use tax law. R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-25.10, replacing R.I. Regs. SU 11-114, effective March 17, 2018. Similarly, where a retailer or permittee has filed a sales and use tax return monthly, but has reported only a sales tax and has left blank the lines on the return referring to the use tax, and the filing of the return was made in good faith, the filing sets the running of the statute as to both the sales and use tax and an assessment for recovery of any use tax claimed to be due must be made and the determination mailed to the taxpayer within three years after the return was filed. A return is considered to be made in good faith if it contains no information that is misleading or is not designed to prevent discovery of material facts necessary to make an assessment. The three year statute of limitations does not apply to operate against the state in case of fraud or an intent to evade the State of Rhode Island law by the taxpayer. R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-25.10, replacing R.I. Regs. SU 11-114, effective March 17, 2018. Where a taxpayer or retailer who is required to file a return under the provisions of the sales and use tax law fails to file a return at all, the statute of limitations is inoperative against the state and an assessment covering a period of six years may be made against the taxpayer. R.I. Code Regs. tit. 280, §20-70-25.10, replacing R.I. Regs. SU 11-114, effective March 17, 2018. BNA-SUTN RI 31.11.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Civil Penalties

Yes If negligence or intentional disregard for Rhode Island sales and use tax law is the basis for any part of a deficiency that is made against a taxpayer, then a penalty of 10 percent of the amount of the determination is added to the determination. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-19-12. Similarly, if fraud or intent to evade the provisions of Rhode Island sales and use tax law is the basis for any part of a deficiency assessed against a taxpayer, then a penalty of 50 percent of the amount of the determination is added to the determination. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-19-12. If any person fails to file a return with the State of Rhode Island, the Tax Administrator will make an estimate of the amount of the gross receipts of the person or, as the case may be, of the amount of the total sales price of tangible personal property sold or purchased by the person, the storage, use, or other consumption of tangible personal property in the state is subject to the Rhode Island use tax. An estimate of the taxpayer's sales and use of property and services is made for the month or months that the person failed to make a return based upon any information already in the tax administrator's possession or as may come into his possession. The Tax Administrator uses the estimate to compute and determine the amount of sales and use tax required to be paid to the state, adding a penalty to the sum of the tax equal to 10 percent of the tax determination. One or more determinations may be made for one or for more than one month. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-19-14. When a taxpayer fails to file and remit collected sales tax, the tax administrator may revoke the taxpayer's license. A hearing is required, and the administrator must give the taxpayer notice at least five days before the hearing. At the hearing the taxpayer may show cause as to why their license should not be revoked. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-19-5 The amount of the tax determination, exclusive of penalties, is subject to and increased by interest at the annual rate provided by Rhode Island law. This interest to be added to the tax determination is calculated from the fifteenth day after the close of the month for which the amount of any portion of the tax should have been paid, until the date of payment of the tax. If the failure of any person to file a return is determined to be due to fraud or an intent to evade Rhode Island sales and use tax law, a penalty of 50 percent of the amount required to be paid by the person, exclusive of penalties, is added to the determination in addition to the 10 percent penalty stated above. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-19-14. Non-collecting retailers who fail to comply with Rhode Island's registration, collection, and remittance requirements or notice and reporting requirements are subject to a penalty of $10 for each failure to comply, but not more than a total penalty or $10,000 per calendar year. Each instance of failing to comply constitutes a separate violation for purposes of calculating the penalty. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-18.2-5, as added by 2017 R.I. H. 5175, Substitute A as amended, Art. 8, §18, effective July 1, 2017. BNA-SUTN RI 31.12.1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Criminal Penalties

Yes A taxpayer's willful failure to comply with Rhode Island tax laws may result in felony charges, and if found guilty of such charges, the taxpayer may be fined in an amount up to $10,000, imprisoned for one year, or both. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-19-31. Retailers who willfully fail to file a return, or cause the willful filing of a false return, report, certificate, affidavit, representation, information, testimony, or statement required or authorized by law may be subject to criminal penalties. Additionally, a person who willfully fails to file a required bond or willfully fails to comply with tax laws, or fails to file a registration certificate and data in connection with the registration certificate as required by the Tax Administrator by regulation, may be found guilty of and punished for a felony. A person who fails to display or surrender a permit as required, or is found to have assigned or transferred a permit may be found guilty and punished for commission of a felony. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-19-31. Also specifically identified as conduct that may give rise to the punishment for a felony is a person's failing to file a notice of a show, failing to display a permit to operate a show, operating a show without obtaining a permit, or permitting a person to display or sell tangible personal property, services, or food and drink at a show without displaying a permit. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-19-31. The willful failure to separately charge a tax imposed or to separately state the tax on any bill, statement, memorandum, or receipt issued or employed by a person required to separately state the tax, or the willful failure to collect the tax from a customer, or to refer to the sales or use tax in a form or manner not permitted by law, or the failure to keep any records required by this chapter, may also be found guilty and punished by felony. R.I. Gen. Laws §44-19-31. A person who engages in business as a retailer within the State of Rhode Island without a permit or after a permit has been suspended or revoked, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and will be fined in an amount up to $5,000 for each offense or be imprisoned for up to one year, or be punished by both the fine and imprisonment. Each officer of any corporation that engages in retail business without a permit or after a permit as been suspended or revoked, is also guilty of a misdemeanor and will be fined in an amount up to $5,000 for each offense or be imprisoned for up to one year, or be punished by both the fine and the imprisonment.

Additionally, the Tax Division will not audit the taxpayer for the tax type and time period involved in the self-audit. Rhode Island Advisory 2015-20 (Nov. 3, 2015). In determining whether to authorize a managed audit, the Tax Administrator may consider any of the following (in addition to other relevant facts):• the taxpayer's history of compliance; • the amount of time and resources the taxpayer has available to dedicate to the managed audit; • the extent and availability of the taxpayer's records; and • the taxpayer's ability to pay any expected liability.
