Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Tangible Personal Property

Origin-Based Virginia follows origin-based sourcing rules, and therefore sales are sourced to the city or county of the place of business of the dealer collecting the tax, regardless of where possible use by the purchaser may occur. Va. Regs. §10-210-2070. Sales of tangible personal property are sourced as follows:• where the sale occurs at the place of business of the seller, this sale is sourced to that location, even if the goods are ultimately delivered to the purchaser at another location; • where a remote sale is made by an in-state dealer with a place of business in Virginia, the sale is sourced to the location where the order was first taken, regardless of whether the goods are ultimately delivered to another location. • where a purchase is made from an out-of-state dealer, and the property is not received at the dealer's location, the sale is sourced to the location to which the goods are delivered. Va. Regs. §10-210-2070(B)(1); Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 18-164 (Sept. 26, 2018); Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 18-3 (Jan. 3, 2018); Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 13-103 (June 13, 2013). “Place of business”means the Virginia business location where the purchaser's order is first taken, and includes a store, sales office, or warehouse. The order may be taken either in person, by purchase order or letter, or by phone, and the place of business is determined regardless of the location of the merchandise or the point of acceptance of the order or shipment. Va. Regs. §10-210-2070. A sale of tangible personal property that is delivered in Virginia before being shipped outside of the state is subject to Virginia retail sales and use tax. The possession and storage of the items in Virginia prior to transport out-of-state constitute “use”for sales and use tax purposes. The subsequent sale outside of Virginia does not exempt the transaction from the sales and use tax. Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 09-141 (Sept. 29, 2009); see also Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 11-6 (Jan. 14, 2011). However, use of an intermediary, such as a freight broker, to transport the tangible personal property from the seller to the out-of-state consumer has been ruled an exempt sale in interstate commerce. Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 12-123 (July 30, 2012). A sale of tangible personal property does not occur in Virginia when a company headquartered in Virginia makes a sale to a company headquartered in Virginia when the seller ships the property from an out-of-state location to the purchaser's out-of-state facility. Because the property never enters Virginia and the transfer occurs completely outside the state, the sale is not subject to Virginia sales and use tax. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-609.104; Va. Regs. §10-210-780A; Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 14-81 (May 30, 2014). Use Tax Generally, use tax is sourced to the city or county where the goods are used or consumed by the purchaser, or stored for use or consumption. Va. Regs. §10-210-2070(B)(2); Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 13-103 (June 13, 2013). An out-of-state dealer who holds a certificate of registration to collect use tax from Virginia customers must source sales into Virginia based on the city or county of destination. An out-of-state dealer with a place of business in Virginia is required to register as a Virginia dealer. If that dealer receives orders from Virginia customers at a place of business outside of Virginia, the dealer must also register as an out-of-state dealer. Va. Regs. §10-210-2070(B)(2). Example: Dealer A is a North Carolina seller who holds a Virginia certificate of registration to collect Virginia use tax. Dealer A makes an Internet sale to a customer and ships the goods to the City of Fairfax in the Northern Virginia Region. Result: Dealer A collects 6 percent use tax (4.3 percent state, 0.7 percent Regional, and 1 percent local) on the sale. The 1 percent local tax is sourced to the City of Fairfax. Va. Regs. §10-210-2070(B)(2). Virginia consumers who purchase goods from remote sellers who are not required to collect Virginia sales and use tax, or who bring into the state goods that were purchased tax-free while outside the state, are subject to the consumer use tax. The use tax is sourced where the goods are used or consumed by the purchaser, or stored for use or consumption. Va. Regs. §10-210-2070(B)(3). BNA-SUTN VA 4.1.1.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Leases and Rentals

Origin-Based The lease of tangible personal property from a Virginia lessor is sourced to the lessor's place of business. Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 13-103 (June 13, 2013). Generally, sales by dealers located in Virginia are sourced to the city or county of the place of business where the sale was made, regardless of the county or city of possible use by the purchaser. Va. Regs. §10-210-2070(B)(1); Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 13-103 (June 13, 2013). BNA-SUTN VA 4.1.3.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Local Sourcing

Origin-Based The local option sales and use tax and regional sales and use tax are sourced in the same manner as the state retail sales and use tax. Va. Regs. §10-210-2070; Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 13-103 (June 13, 2013). Thus, intrastate transactions are sourced to the city or county of the place of business of the dealer collecting the tax, regardless of the city or county of possible use by the purchaser. Va. Regs. §10-210-2070; Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 18-164 (Sept. 26, 2018) (ready-mix concrete sales sourced to location that received the order, even if concrete continued to be mixed up to the point of delivery); Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 18-3 (Jan. 3, 2018); Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 13-103 (June 13, 2013). A dealer making sales at his or her place of business located in the Northern Virginia or Hampton Roads regions must collect the regional sales tax, even if the goods are shipped outside of those regions. Similarly, dealers who are not located in the Northern Virginia or Hampton Roads regions do not collect the regional sales tax, even if goods sold are shipped into the Northern Virginia or Hampton Roads regions. Va. Regs. §10-210-2070; Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 13-103 (June 13, 2013). BNA-SUTN VA 4.1.4.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Credit for Tax Paid to Another Jurisdiction

Yes Virginia allows a reciprocal use tax credit up to the amount of any sales or use tax paid to another state or political subdivision thereof. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-611. In addition to state taxes paid, Virginia allows a taxpayer to take a credit against Virginia state taxes due for local taxes paid as well as taxes paid to the District of Columbia. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-611; Va. Regs. §10-210-450. The amount of credit allowed may not exceed the tax imposed under Virginia's retail sales and use tax provisions. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-611. If a taxpayer erroneously pays sales tax to another state or political subdivision, the taxpayer may not take a credit against its Virginia use tax for the erroneous payment. Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 17-117 (June 29, 2017); Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 17-116 (June 29, 2017). Virginia imposes a special state use tax on motor vehicles, machinery and tools, aircraft, and equipment brought into Virginia for use in performing construction contracts. Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 88-246 (July 1, 1988). The special use tax does not apply to articles purchased in a state that does not impose a similar use tax upon Virginia con-tractors and is imposed at a rate of 3 ½ percent on all property, except motor vehicles which will be taxed at a 3 percent rate and watercraft and aircraft which will be taxed at a 2% rate. The tax will be computed based upon the proportion of time that the property will be used in Virginia to its overall useful life. Virginia Ruling of the Commissioner PD 88-246 (July 1, 1988). BNA-SUTN VA 4.2.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Temporary Presence, In-Transit Property Tangible Personal Property First Used Out-of-state

Depends Virginia's use tax does not apply to tangible personal property purchased and first used outside the state by a nonresident individual or business entity not doing business in the state, who later brings such property into Virginia in connection with establishing a permanent residence or business in the state. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-607. The out-of-state purchase must be made more than six months prior to the earlier of: (1) the property first entering the state; or (2) the establishment of residency or the business in the state. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-607. Tangible personal property that has been acquired for use outside this Commonwealth which is brought to Virginia for use within six months is taxed on the basis of its cost price. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-604. The exemption from use tax for property first used outside of Virginia and later brought into the state does not apply to tangible personal property first used outside of the state and temporarily brought into the state for the performance of contracts for the construction, reconstruction, installation, repair or any other services with respect to real estate or fixtures on real estate. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-607;Va. Regs. §10-210-6030(D). Tangible personal property purchased for use outside the state but later brought into the state for such purposes is taxed based on the proportion of the cost price or fair market value (not to exceed cost price) as the duration of time of use within this state bears to the total useful life of the property. Va. Regs. §10-210-6030(D); Va. Code Ann. §58.1-604. It is presumed that the property will remain in this state for the remainder of its useful life until otherwise proven. Va. Regs. §10-210-6030(D); Va. Code Ann. §58.1-604. Virginia does not, however, impose use tax on motor vehicles, machinery, or equipment purchased for use and actually placed into substantial use in another state before entering Virginia for use in constructing or repairing the owner's own buildings, structures, or other property. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-604.3. Sales tax is due on fair market value if a vehicle has been purchased within the last 12 months and evidence is not provided showing sales tax paid in another state. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-2403(10). It should also be noted that Virginia classifies imported merchandise located in the state's foreign trade zones and merchandise destined for export in such zones as intangible personal property which is not subject to the state's general rate of tax. Va. Code Ann. §58.1-1101; Va. Regs. §10-340-20. BNA-SUTN VA 4.3.1.
