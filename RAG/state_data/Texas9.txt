Depends Only services that are enumerated in Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101 and services which are related to the sale of tangible property are taxable. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101; Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 27,531 (Sept. 10, 1991). The distinction between services and tangible personal property becomes less important, with the focus shifting to the distinction between services related to a sale of tangible property (taxable) and unrelated services (generally not taxable). For example a taxpayer was required to collect tax on modification services that it performed on software programs sold to customers as part of a data processing package, despite the fact that the taxpayer separated its modification services from its data processing services for billing purposes. Because the services were necessary in order for data to be transmitted from the customers' computers to the taxpayer's computers, they were an integral part of the data processing package, and the charges were taxable as part of the cost of the data processing services. Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 27,531 (Sept. 10, 1991). The following services are enumerated as taxable:• amusement services; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101(a)(1). • cable television services; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101(a)(2). • personal services; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101(a)(3). • motor vehicle parking and storage services; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101(a)(4); Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.315. • repair, remodeling, maintenance, and restoration services performed on most types of tangible personal property; See Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101(a)(5). Broadly speaking, the exceptions are for transportation-related property. • telecommunications services; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101(a)(6). • credit reporting services; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101(a)(7). • debt collection services; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101(a)(8); see Texas Tax Policy News (April 2017). • insurance services; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101(a)(9). • information services; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101(a)(10). • real property services; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101(a)(11). • data processing services; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101(a)(12). • real property repair and remodeling; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101(a)(13). • security services; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101(a)(14). • telephone answering services; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101(a)(15). • internet access service; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101(a)(16). and • certain utility transmission and distribution services. See Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101(a)(17). Services that are not specifically enumerated as taxable are nontaxable services. See Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.0101(a) (enumerating 17 types of services on which Texas imposes sales and use tax).

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

Taxable The taxable sales price of a taxable item includes a service that is connected with the sale. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §151.007(b); see Sharp v. Park ‘n Fly of Texas Inc., 969 S.W.2d 572 (Tex. App. 1998). However, the question may arise as to whether the transaction is one for a sale of a taxable item or a nontaxable service. The established test for determining how to classify a transaction is the ultimate object or “essence of the transaction” test. The essence of the transaction is the customer's basic purpose in entering into the transaction. Sharp v. Direct Res. for Print Inc., 910 S.W.2d 535 (Tex. App. 1995);Williams & Lee Scouting Serv. Inc. v. Calvert, 452 S.W.2d 789 (Tex. App. 1970) (technical data provided monthly in report to customers is sale of service not subject to sales tax); Bullock v. Statistical Tabulating Corp., 549 S.W.2d 166, 167 (Tex. 1977) (data supplied on data processing card not subject to sales tax); Texas Comp. of Pub. Accts. v. Austin Multiple Listing Serv. Inc., 723 S.W.2d 163 (Tex. App.1986) (payments made to compile and process data for real estate listings not subject to sales tax); Rylander v. Assoc. Technics Co., 987 S.W.2d 947 (Tex. App. 1999) (payments for asbestos abatement service not subject to sales tax). In determining the object of the transaction, many factors are relevant, and the issue must be determined on a case-by-case basis. If the essence of the sale is not tangible personal property or a taxable service, but instead is a nontaxable service, then the transaction is not taxable. Sharp v. Direct Res. for Print Inc., 910 S.W.2d 535 (Tex. App. 1995); see also Combs v. Chevron, Inc., 319 S.W.3d 836 (Tex. App. 2010) (discussing “essence of the transaction” and other factors for determining taxability of transactions that involve both taxable and nontaxable elements); Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 201705005L (May 16, 2017) (transaction involving transfer of possession but not title to mobile point-of-sale devices by taxpayer to restaurants constituted taxable rental of tangible personal property despite contract characterizing charges as service fees; the “essence of the transaction” was the rental of devices was and any services provided were incidental to rental of the property); Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing Nos. 113,293, 113,294 (Feb. 7, 2018) (invoice with separated charges for engineering services and equipment was insufficient to establish that the items should be analyzed separately). Any ambiguities in the application of the essence of the transaction test must be resolved in the taxpayer's favor because taxing statutes must be construed strictly against the taxing authority and liberally in favor of the entity being taxed. Sharp v. Direct Res. for Print Inc., 910 S.W.2d 535 (Tex. App. 1995). When the purchase of a nontaxable service is combined with the purchase of taxable property, but each transaction is independently desired and independently provided, there results a mixed transaction in which neither element represents the essence of the sale. In such a situation, where the two elements are readily separable, the nontaxable service and the property must be analyzed as two completely separate transactions. Rylander v. San Antonio SMSA L.P., 11 S.W.3d 484 (Tex. App. 2000). If charges for the taxable goods and services are not separated from charges for non-taxable goods and services, tax is due on the combined charge. Rylander v. San Antonio SMSA L.P., 11 S.W.3d 484 (Tex. App. 2000). BNA-SUTN TX 9.3.1.

Taxable When an exempt item is sold together with taxable merchandise in a pre-packaged combination or single unit and the predominant cost of the set or unit is taxable, then the full price is subject to sales tax unless the price of the eligible item is separately stated. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.365(e). When non-taxable services are sold with taxable services or with taxable goods, tax is due on the total cost unless the charges are separated. Texas Comptroller's Letter No. 9903280L,(Mar. 12, 1999). BNA-SUTN TX 9.3.2.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Local Jurisdictions, Taxability Distinctions

Conforms to State Local sales and use taxes are applied in accordance with Texas law governing the application of the state sales tax. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.208. However, state law provides that telecommunications services are subject to the state sales tax, but are exempt from all local sales taxes. Nevertheless, the governing body of a city, county, transit authority, or other special purpose district may repeal this exemption and vote to impose local sales tax on these services. The local sales tax is limited to telecommunications services occurring between locations within Texas and is collected based on where the call originates. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.210; Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.344(h); Texas Tax Publication 96-339 (also identifying the jurisdictions that have imposed local sales tax on telecommunications services). See Texas Comptroller's Decision, Hearing No. 112,301 (Dec. 29, 2016)(upholding local sales tax imposed on taxpayer's complex WAN services that included elements of private communications services, intrastate long-distance services, and interstate long distance services; taxpayer failed to separately state on its customer's invoices the nontaxable interstate components and taxable intrastate charges and thus, the entire amount of the charges was subject to local tax). For mobile telecommunications services, the local sales tax rate is determined by the customer's place of primary use, generally the residential or primary business street address. For telecommunication services billed call-by-call or per transmission, the local sales tax rate is determined by where the call or transmission originates. For telephone calls not billed call-by-call, the local sales tax rate is determined by the customer's place of primary use. Tex. Tax Code Ann. §321.210; Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.344(h); Texas Tax Publication 96-339 (also identifying the jurisdictions that have imposed local sales tax on telecommunications services). Additionally, the sale of cable television or bundled cable services via direct-to-home satellite is exempt from local tax under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, § 602. “Direct-to-home satellite” refers to cable television or bundled cable service that is transmitted directly to a purchaser's premises without the use of ground receiving or distribution equipment, except at the purchaser's premises or in the uplink process to the satellite. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.313(g)(2). The residential use of gas or electricity may be subject to local sales and use taxes. Tex. Admin. Code tit. 34, §3.295(b). BNA-SUTN TX 9.4.
