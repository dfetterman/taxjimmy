Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Real Property

Deductible Real property meets the definition of “property” for purposes of the gross receipts tax; however, receipts from the sale or lease of real property are deductible from gross receipts. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-53(A); New Mexico Bulletin FYI-105. However, the portion of the receipts from the sale of real property that is attributable to improvements constructed on the real property by the seller in the ordinary course of his construction business may not be deducted from gross receipts. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-53(A); see New Mexico Ruling No. 430-14-1 (July 25, 2014) (taxpayer engages with customer to build a home, hires a contractor to complete the work, and sells the home. Taxpayer's services in this series of transactions were deductible from gross receipts as part of the sale of real property, while the services of the contractor remained subject to gross receipts tax as improvements constructed on real property). This limitation does not apply to receipts from the sale of real property attributable to improvements constructed by a licensed contractor for a non-contractor seller. New Mexico Ruling 430-17-1 (July 26, 2017). Receipts from the lease of a manufactured home are also deductible. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-53(A); New Mexico Bulletin FYI-105. Receipts from the sale or lease of oil, natural gas, or other mineral interests are not deductible as real property. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-53(A). Sales or leases of oil, natural gas, or other mineral interests are exempt from gross receipts tax instead. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-32; New Mexico Bulletin FYI-105. The proportion of the receipts from the sale of real property attributable to improvements constructed on the real property is determined by subtracting from the sales price the cost of the land to the seller. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.211.9(A)(1). However, if there is substantial evidence that the value of the land is not the cost of the land to the seller, then it is determined by subtracting from the sales price the value of the land as determined by an independent appraisal. In no case may the appraised value of the land exceed the difference between the sale price of the real property and the total cost of the improvements constructed on the real property. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.211.9(A)(2). The cost of the land to the seller is determined by the original cost of the land to the seller plus any amounts attributable to the land being sold by the seller for off-site improvements such as paving. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.211.9(B). Receipts attributable to the inclusion of furniture or appliances furnished as part of a leased or rented dwelling house, manufactured home or apartment by the landlord or lessor are deductible. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-53(C). Construction Deduction Receipts from leasing construction equipment to persons engaged in the construction business as set forth under N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-52, provided the leased equipment is used at the construction location of a construction project that is subject to gross receipts tax upon its completion or sale. A deduction for leasing to such persons may also be taken if the leased construction equipment is located on the tribal territory of an Indian nation, tribe, or pueblo. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-52; New Mexico Bulletin FYI-105; New Mexico Public Decision No. 16-50 (Oct. 27, 2016). Sales of Natural Gas, Water, and Electricity When the lessor of real property conveys water, natural gas, or electricity to a lessee as a condition of the lease of the real property, the lessor is using the water, natural gas, or electricity to fulfill the conditions of the lease whether or not a separate charge is made to the lessee. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.205.21. The lessor is not reselling the water, natural gas, or electricity in the ordinary course of business and may not execute a nontaxable transaction certificate under N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-47. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.205.21. BNA-SUTN NM 28.1.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Construction Materials and Contracts Construction Materials and Contracts, Generally

Taxable Receipts of a construction contractor generated from a construction project are subject to gross receipts tax. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-3(M); N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-3.5(A)(1). Receipts from a construction project include charges for labor and charges for all tangible personal property that will become an ingredient or component part of the construction project. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-3(M); N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-3.5(A)(1). Receipts for construction projects will not be exempted from the gross receipts tax as “wages” unless the contractor can demonstrate to the Department that the receipts are derived from an employment relationship whereby they are employees within the meaning of N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.105.7, which lists the indicia considered to determine whether a person is an employee. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.105.7. ‘Construction’ Defined The term “construction” is defined to mean the building, altering, repairing, or demolishing in the ordinary course of business any:• road, highway, bridge, parking area, or related project; • building, stadium, or other structure; • airport, subway, or similar facility; • park, trail, athletic field, golf course, or similar facility; • dam, reservoir, canal, ditch, or similar facility; • sewerage or water treatment facility, power generating plant, pump station, natural gas compressing station, gas processing plant, coal gasification plant, refinery, distillery or similar facility; • sewerage, water, gas, or other pipeline; • transmission line; • radio, television, or other tower; • water, oil, or other storage tank; • shaft, tunnel, or other mining appurtenance; • microwave station or similar facility; or • retaining wall, wall, fence, gate, or similar structure. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-3.4(A)(1). “Construction” also includes the leveling or clearing of land, the excavating of earth, and the drilling of wells of any type. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-3.4(A)(2); N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-3.4(A)(3); N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-3.4(A)(4). Construction Materials Sales of construction materials to contractors are deductible from taxable gross receipts if the contractor delivers a nontaxable transaction certificate to the seller. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-51(A). To qualify for the deduction, the materials must be an intended part of the end product of a construction project. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.209.7. In order to purchase materials under a nontaxable transaction certificate, the buyer must incorporate the construction material as:• an ingredient or component part of a construction project that is subject to gross receipts tax upon its completion; N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-51(B)(1). • an ingredient or component part of a construction project that is subject to gross receipts tax upon the sale in the ordinary course of business of the real property upon which the project was constructed; N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-51(B)(2). or • an ingredient or component part of a construction project that is located on the tribal territory of an Indian nation, tribe, or pueblo. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-51(B)(3). “Construction material” is tangible personal property that becomes or is intended to become an ingredient or component part of a construction project, but does not include a replacement fixture when the replacement is not construction or a replacement part for a fixture. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-3.4(B). To be an ingredient or component part the tangible personal property must be an intended part of the end product of construction. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.209.7. In determining whether tangible personal property will become an ingredient or component part of a construction project, the Department of Revenue will consider multiple factors, including but not limited to the following: • whether the person performing the work was using the tangible personal property was required to be licensed under the Construction Industries Licensing Act; and • whether the work where the tangible personal property was used required a permit from a trade board or mechanical department. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.209.22. Compensating Tax on Construction Materials If a construction project is built with materials purchased using a nontaxable transaction certificate is later purchased by a person engaged in the construction business, compensating tax is due on the value of the construction materials incorporated into the project. The value reported is the actual cost. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.209.21. Construction Materials Used for Nontaxable Projects Receipts from the sale of construction materials are only deductible from gross receipts if the materials will be incorporated into a project subject to gross receipts tax within New Mexico or incorporated into a project located on the tribal territory of an Indian nation, tribe, or pueblo. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-51(B). If a contractor purchases construction materials in New Mexico using a nontaxable transaction certificate and subsequently uses the materials on a project that does not qualify for the construction materials deduction because the project itself is not subject to gross receipts tax or is not located on tribal territory, the contractor is liable for compensating use tax on the value of the materials used. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.209.24. Receipts from selling construction materials or a construction service may be deducted from gross receipts if the sale is made to a person engaged in the construction business or a prime contractor, and the prime contractor delivers the nontaxable transaction certificate to the seller. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-51; N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-52; New Mexico Public Decision No. 16-50 (Oct. 27, 2016). The prime contractor must incorporate the construction material as an ingredient or component part of the construction project that is:• subject to the gross receipts tax upon completion; • subject to the gross receipts tax upon the sale in the ordinary course of business of the real property it was constructed on; or • located on an Indian nation, tribe, or pueblo. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-51; N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-52; New Mexico Public Decision No. 16-50 (Oct. 27, 2016). Carpets and Draperies The installation of carpets or draperies by itself is not a construction project. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.1.11(C)(1). However, when carpets or draperies are installed in a construction project, the installation is construction and the sale of the carpets or draperies may be treated as the sale of construction materials. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.209.25. Prime Contractor Liability A deduction from the gross receipts tax is provided to the seller of construction materials and construction services when sold to a person engaged in the construction business if a nontaxable transaction certificate is delivered to the seller. Consequently, N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-7 is designed to impose compensating use tax on transactions that would have been subject to the gross receipts tax had it not been for the nontaxable transaction certificate. A person engaged in the construction business who purchases construction materials or construction services from subcontractors is liable for the compensating use tax on the value of the materials and services purchased when the construction project is initially leased or occupied prior to the sale. The use of the nontaxable transaction certificate is the event that subjects the prime contractor to the compensating use tax. Cont'l Inn of Albuquerque, Inc. v. New Mexico Taxn. & Rev. Dept., 113 N.M. 588, 829 P.2d 946 (N.M. Ct. App. 1992); see New Mexico Ruling 405-08-2 (July 8, 2008). Services contracted out to multiple third parties under a single contract by a prime contractor must be prorated by the prime contractor either by: (1) allocating costs using cost accounting records, or (2) on the percentage of the total service actually performed within New Mexico. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-3.5; N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-4; N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-7; N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.1.18(C)(2). However, when a subcontractor service is purchased for resale, and all conditions of N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-48 are met and the subcontracted service is actually sold intact to the prime contractor's customer, the prime contractor may issue a Type 5 Nontaxable Transaction Certificate to the subcontractor and the receipts from the subcontracted service will be deductible from the subcontractor's gross receipts. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-3.5; N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-4; N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-7; N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.1.18(C)(3). More information on the taxation of construction contractors is available at 1840 T.M., State Taxation of Construction Contractors. Examples of Deductible Construction Materials Sales of water can be deducted from gross receipts when sold to a person engaged in the construction business who delivers a nontaxable transaction certificate or alternative evidence if the water becomes an ingredient of the finished product, such as in concrete or moistening fill. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.209.11. Welding rods are similarly deductible when used on a construction project. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.209.13. Receipts from the sale of paint, filler, thinner, varnish, and similar items to a person engaged in the painting business may be deducted from the seller's gross receipts if the purchaser delivers a nontaxable transaction certificate or alternative documentation to the seller. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.209.14(A). However, the receipts from the sale of brushes, sandpaper, scrapers, sand for sandblasting, machinery and similar items to a person in the painting business may not be deducted from gross receipts as these items are not ingredients or component parts of the construction project. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.209.14(B). Windows and Doors Receipts from the sale of screens, screen doors, and windows to a person engaged in the construction business may be deducted from the seller's gross receipts if the buyer delivers a nontaxable transaction certificate or alternative evidence. Additionally, receipts from the sale of aluminum panel, aluminum T-bar, aluminum angle, bulk or roll screen stock and jalousie glass to a person who produces screens, screen doors, or windows and sells them installed in a construction project may be deducted from the seller's gross receipts if the buyer delivers a nontaxable transaction certificate or alternative evidence. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.209.18. Concrete Receipts from selling materials and special coatings used in concrete work may be deducted from gross receipts if the materials sold become an ingredient or component part of a construction project and it is a sale of construction materials to persons engaged in the construction business under N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-51. Concrete curing compounds, hardening agents, and liquid curing compounds that remain on or in concrete become an ingredient or component parts of construction projects. Form coatings and oils used to ease the separation of forms from concrete and snap ties do not become an ingredient or component parts of construction projects, even though they are embedded in concrete. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.209.10. Sprinkler Systems Receipts from selling pipes, joints, nozzles, and similar tangible personal property that become an ingredient or component part of a sprinkler system to a person engaged in the business of selling and installing sprinkler systems may be deducted from gross receipts if the purchaser delivers a nontaxable transaction certificate or alternative evidence. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.209.15. Tangible Personal Property for Oil Fields For purposes of ingredients and component parts used in oil fields, receipts from the sale of casing, cement, shoes and float equipment, casing heads, and well heads may be deducted from gross receipts if the sale of construction materials is to persons engaged in the construction business, the requirements under N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-51 are met, and a nontaxable transaction certificate or alternative evidence is provided by a well drilling company performing the project. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.209.9. Construction-Related Services A person engaged in the construction business may purchase construction-related services for resale. The seller of such services may deduct the receipts from the construction-related services to a person engaged in the construction business who provides a properly completed nontaxable transaction certificate. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-52(A); see New Mexico Public Decision No. 16-45 (Sep. 15, 2016) (discussing architecture as a construction-related service). Construction-related services that may be purchased for resale include design, architecture, drafting, surveying, engineering, environmental testing, structural testing, security, sanitation, and services required to comply with construction-related regulations. General business services such as legal services, accounting, bookkeeping, equipment maintenance, and real estate sales are not eligible. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-52(C). Sales of Construction Materials to Government Agencies Sales of construction materials to government agencies are not deductible from gross receipts when those materials are incorporated into a construction project. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-54(A)(3); New Mexico Public Decision No. 16-42 (taxpayer installed depreciable tangible personal property that became and ingredient or component of a fire station constructed for the city of Englewood. Taxpayer's claim for a deduction was ultimately was disallowed because N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-54(A)(3) expressly provides that the deduction does not apply to receipts from selling construction materials and excludes any items that were incorporated into the project. The Administrative Hearing Office also opined that the taxpayer performed construction services for the government which were not subject to the deduction). Disclosed Agent Liability New Mexico imposes sales and use tax on both the sale of services and goods. However, the receipts of any person received as a reimbursement of expenditures incurred in connection with the performance of a service or the sale or lease of property are taxable gross receipts as defined by N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-3.5, unless that person incurs such expense as agent on behalf of a principal while acting in a disclosed agency capacity. An agency relationship exists if a person has the power to bind a principal in a contract with a third party so that the third party can enforce the contractual obligation against the principal. N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-9-3.5(A)(3)(f); N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.1.19(C); New Mexico Public Decision 15-21 (June 29, 2015); New Mexico Public Decision No. 17-05 (Jan. 19, 2017). A disclosed agent must affirmatively state that they are acting on behalf of a principal, and adhere to specific bookkeeping and billing requirements. N.M. Admin. Code tit. 3, §2.1.19(C)(2); Bogle Mgmt. Co., Inc. v. New Mexico Taxn. & Rev. Dept., No. A-1-CA-35641, (N.M. Ct. App. Dec. 5, 2017). BNA-SUTN NM 28.3.1.
