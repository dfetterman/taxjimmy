Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Vending Machines

Depends The taxability of food purchased from a vending machine is determined by whether the food is meant to be consumed on premises. Szabo Food Service Inc. v. Kosydar, No. 71-08-1875 (Ohio Bd. Tax App., March 9, 1972); Quality Food and Vending Co. v. Lindley, Dkt. CA 9261 (Ohio Ct. App. July 1985). Ohio courts have held that where a seat or a place to sit is nearby the vending machine where the purchaser can consume the food purchased, sales tax applies as the food is consumed on the premises. Szabo Food Service Inc. v. Kosydar, No. 71-08-1875 (Ohio Bd. Tax App., March 9, 1972) (food vending machines owned by owner of restaurant next to where vending machines were located not exempt from sales tax as food was intended to be consumed on premises); Quality Food and Vending Co. v. Lindley, Dkt. CA 9261 (Ohio Ct. App. July 1985) (even though owner of vending machines located in law school's cafeteria did not own sitting area purchases made via machines still subject to tax as food was intended for consumption on premises). When no sitting area is within the vicinity of a vending machine, purchases are considered consumed off premises and are not subject to sales tax. Castleberry v. Evatt, 67 N.E.2d 861 (Ohio 1946) (sale of milk from vending machine at industrial plant not subject to sales taxation as no sitting place existed for milk to be consumed, and purchase was intended for consumption off premises).
