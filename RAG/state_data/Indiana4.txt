Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Aircraft, Intrastate or Non-Commercial Use Purchase, Lease, or Rental Transactions

Taxable Absent a statutory exemption, all sales of aircraft purchased from a registered Indiana dealer are subject to sales and use tax. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-3-6. Isolated and casual sales of aircraft required to be licensed in the state are subject to use tax. The dealer is required to collect the sales tax and provide a completed Form ST-108AC to the customer showing that the tax has been paid. Sales by a person who is not a retail merchant of an aircraft required to be licensed by the state for use in Indiana is a retail transaction, and the use of such aircraft is subject to the use tax which must be paid by the purchaser to the Aeronautics Commission at the time of the licensing of the aircraft by the purchaser. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-3-6. Indiana defines the term “aircraft”as any device which is designed to provide air transportation for one or more individuals or for cargo. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-3-6(a)(1). Temporary Presence in State (‘Fly-away’Exemption) A transaction involving an aircraft, including completion work, is exempt from the sales tax if:• the purchaser is a nonresident; Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-42(a)(1); Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 74. • the purchaser transports the aircraft to a destination outside of Indiana within 30 days after accepting delivery of the aircraft; Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-42(a)(2)(A); Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 74. a repair, refurbishment, or remanufacture of the aircraft is completed, if the aircraft remains in Indiana after the purchaser accepts delivery for the purpose of accomplishing the repair; Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-42(a)(2)(B); Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 74. or accepting delivery of the aircraft following completion work or a pre-purchase evaluation; Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-42(a)(2)(C); Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 74. • the aircraft is or will be titled or registered in another state or country; Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-42(a)(3)(A); Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 74. or based in that state or country, if a state or country does not require a title or registration for aircraft; Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-42(a)(3)(B); Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 74. and • the aircraft will not be titled or registered in Indiana. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-42(a)(4); Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 74. The purchaser must provide to the seller a copy of the out-of-state aircraft registration within 60 days after completing the purchase and accepting delivery, or repair, refurbishment, or remanufacture. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 74. Any non-resident who bases an aircraft within Indiana for more than 60 days is required to register the aircraft for use in Indiana. Aircraft so registered are subject to use tax. If an aircraft is hangared in Indiana, it creates a presumption that the aircraft should have been registered in Indiana, even if it is not actually registered. The owner of the aircraft can rebut the presumption by proving the aircraft was not based in Indiana for 60 days. In the absence of such evidence, use tax will be assessed. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20160453 (Feb. 22, 2017). Aircraft Previously Registered in Another State Indiana does not impose use tax on aircraft to be registered in the state if such aircraft was previously registered in another state as of Jan. 1, 2017, and sales and use tax was paid to the registration state. There must be no outstanding tax liability related to the aircraft in the registration state, and ownership of the aircraft must not change after Dec. 31, 2016. The application for registration in Indiana must be filed after June 30, 2017, or on or before Sept. 30, 2017, and any registration fees and aircraft excise taxes must be paid. Ind. Code Ann. §6-6-6.5-25, as amended by 2017 Ind. S.B. 515, § 19, effective July 1, 2017. Sales at Auction Sales of aircraft by a licensed auction company or auctioneer are subject to Indiana sales tax if the auction is conducted at a site owned, leased, or provided by the auction house or auctioneer. All sales are subject to tax unless the purchaser provides a valid exemption form. If an auction house or auctioneer sells motor vehicles and a purchaser will transport and title or register a vehicle for use outside of Indiana within 30 days after delivery, the purchaser and auction house or auctioneer must complete form ST- 108NR in order to charge the sales or use tax rate for the destination state or country. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 20. Leases The acquisition of an aircraft for renting or leasing in the ordinary course of the person's business is taxable unless the lessor establishes that the annual amount of the gross lease revenue is equal to or greater than 7.5 percent of the book value of the aircraft as published in the Aircraft Value Reference guide or the net acquisition price for the aircraft. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-8(e); see Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20150449 (Dec. 30, 2015) (taxpayer was able to substantiate that although it did not register its airplane within the amount of time required by statute, it did remit sales tax to Indiana based on a rental agreement that exceeded 7.5 percent of the aircraft's value); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20140321 (Jan. 28, 2015) (LLC failed to show that it was in the business of leasing aircraft and was therefore subject to tax on its acquisition of aircraft hangared in Indiana); Indiana Revenue Ruling 2015-20ST (July 14, 2016) (taxpayer required to collect gross lease revenue equal to or greater than 7.5 percent of the full net acquisition price of its aircraft after being denied a reduction in the tax base based on a like-kind exchange). When a person leases or rents an aircraft in conjunction with providing flight instruction, the amount charged with the lease or rental of the aircraft is subject to tax. Ind. Code Ann. § 6-2.5-4-16.2, as enacted by 2009 H.B. 1198, effective April 30, 2009. BNA-SUTN IN 29.1.1.

Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Aircraft, Interstate and Common Carrier Purchase, Lease, or Rental Transactions

Depends Aircraft used in interstate commerce or as common carriers, will likely be considered public transportation property and therefore exempt from gross retail tax. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-27; Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 12. Public transportation is defined as the movement, transportation or carrying of persons or property for consideration by a common carrier, contract carrier, household goods carrier, carriers of exempt commodities, and other specialized carriers, performing public transportation service for compensation by highway, rail, air or water, which carriers operate under authority issued by, or are specifically exempt by statute or regulation. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-27(a); Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-5-61(b). For a company to be considered engaged in public transportation, the following requirements must be met:• the company must transport persons or the property of others; • the company must hold and pay for public transportation insurance; • the company must receive compensation for the transportation services provided; • the company must be authorized to provide public transportation services; • in a situation where an employee provides services for both the parent company and leased duties for a transportation company, the parent company must maintain records detailing which party the employee was providing services to; • if the parent company makes a capital contribution of the vehicles, title to the vehicles must transfer to the transportation company; • the parent company and transportation company must maintain separate books and records, including separate charts of accounts for: transactions between entities showing the actual invoicing and payments for every transaction; and each entity's segregated and accounted for purchases and expenses; and • the entities must have an arm's-length relationship including separate incomes and expenses for separate federal income tax filings. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 12. A key factor in determining whether the entities have an arm's-length relationship is whether or not the transportation services are being paid for. If the parent company or other related entity pays the transportation company for the transportation services, it supports a finding that there is an arm's length relationship. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20140502 (June 29, 2016) (determining whether two subsidiary companies subsidiary companies had an arm's-length relationship); see also Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20150416 (March 30, 2016) (denying an exemption because taxpayer did not provide sufficient evidence of an arm's-length relationship). In the case of related companies, where one provides public transportation of property for hire and the other provides property and services to the public transportation company, the second company is not transporting property for the public, is therefore subject to tax.

Taxable Absent a statutory exemption, all sales of motor vehicles and trailers purchased from a registered Indiana dealer are subject to Indiana sales and use tax. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-3-5; Indiana Revenue Ruling 2014-09ST (April 7, 2015). Optional products consisting of tangible personal property and a service that are installed prior to a vehicle prior to the sale of the vehicle are included in a motor vehicle's sales price. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20160500 (Sept. 27, 2017); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20160349 (Aug. 30, 2017). This includes sales where the purchaser intends to immediately register, license, or title the motor vehicle or trailer for use in another state. The dealer is required to collect the sales tax and provide a completed Form ST-108 to the customer showing that the tax has been paid. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-3-5; Indiana Revenue Ruling 2014-09ST (April 7, 2015). Documentation fees for services performed before the customer takes possession of the vehicle or trailer are subject to sales tax. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-4-1(e); Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 28S; Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20170994 (Sept. 26, 2018). If the purchaser presents an affidavit stating that it intends to transport the vehicle to a destination outside Indiana within 30 days of the delivery and register that vehicle outside Indiana, then the dealer may collect the tax at the rate imposed by the destination state or country. The dealer will then provide a completed Form ST-108 as proof of the amount of tax that has been paid. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-2-3(b); Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 28S, see e.g., Indiana Memorandum Decision 04-20181393R (Aug. 29, 2018) (no sales tax should have been collected from purchaser who intended to transport the vehicle to and register it in Washington, D.C., which imposes an excise tax, not a sales tax, on vehicles). If the purchaser does not present an affidavit in the required format, the purchaser must pay the full amount of tax imposed by Indiana and its localities. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-2-3(b); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20150416 (March 30, 2016) (taxpayer required to pay the full amount of Indiana tax due on the purchase of a vehicle delivered to and used within Iowa because it did not present the required affidavit to the dealer). The fact that the state the vehicle is transported to does not allow a credit for sales tax paid in another state does not change the taxability of the transaction in Indiana. If the sale of a vehicle is completed in Indiana, tax is due regardless of whether or not sales or use tax will also be due in another state. Indiana Final Order 04-20182183R (Jan. 24, 2019) (vehicle purchased in Indiana but registered in Missouri with sales tax paid in Indiana at a Missouri rate; taxpayer denied refund because Indiana does not have an exemption for purchases made with insurance proceeds whereas Missouri does); Indiana Memorandum Decision 04-20171204R (March 28, 2018) (vehicle purchased in Indiana but registered in West Virginia and sales tax paid in both states; taxpayer only entitled to a refund reflecting the difference between the two states' rates); Indiana Final Order 04-20170102R (June 28, 2017); (owing Mississippi use tax on a recreational vehicle purchased in Indiana does not preclude Indiana from imposing sales tax to the transaction); Indiana Final Order 04-20160562R (March 9, 2017) (refund of sales tax denied on purchase of motor vehicle on which Arkansas sales tax was also due); see Indiana Memorandum Decision 04-20170736R (April 26, 2017) (where vehicle was purchased in Indiana but titled and registered in West Virginia within 30 days of sale, partial refund granted of amount of Indiana sales tax paid that exceeded amount of tax due other state; additional refund denied where West Virginia did not allow credit for Indiana tax paid on the vehicle); Indiana Memorandum Decision 04-20180231 (Feb. 13, 2018) (double taxation of a sale is not an enumerated ground for refund). But see Indiana Memorandum Decision 04-20181393R (Aug. 29, 2018) (refund of Indiana tax appropriate where buyer registered vehicle in Washington, D.C. which does not impose sales tax on vehicles but rather an excise tax, and does not allow credits against that tax for sales tax paid in other states). This alternate calculation of the sales tax rate for vehicles intended to be transported out of state within 30 days does not apply to motor homes, trucks weighing more than 11,000 pounds, or trailers. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 28S; Indiana Letters of Findings 04-20160712 and 04-20160713 (Feb. 28, 2018) (Kentucky sales tax rate did not apply to the sale of a truck weighing more than 44,001 pounds). Customer-Returned Vehicles Transactions that result in customer-returned vehicle for which sales tax has been collected and remitted by the retail merchant may qualify for a refund of sales tax, in whole or in part, to the retail merchant if:• the vehicle is returned within the number of days allowed for a return pursuant to the retail merchant's publicly stated return policy or specified in the written contract entered into between the purchaser and retail merchant, not to exceed 90 days; • the vehicle is returned pursuant to explicit, written terms of the parties'contractual agreement or the retail merchant's publicly stated return policy; and • the purchaser of the vehicle is refunded the entire purchase price including any sales tax (i.e., the amount actually collected by the retail merchant from the purchaser of the vehicle). Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 28S; Indiana Final Order 04-20181341 (Sept. 26, 2018) (where purchasers return vehicle after more than 90 days of use and do not provide documentation indicating that the return was pursuant to a contractual agreement or the dealer's publicly stated return policy, purchasers are not entitled to a refund of the sales tax paid on the purchase of their vehicle). Interstate Sales Exception Indiana does not impose sales and use tax on the sale of a motor vehicle or trailers sold in interstate commerce. For a vehicle or trailer to be sold in interstate commerce, the vehicle or trailer usually must be physically delivered by the selling dealer to a delivery point outside Indiana. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-5-53; Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 28S (clarifying that sales to an out-of-state buyer who takes possession of the vehicle or trailer within Indiana does not qualify as a sale in interstate commerce); Richardson's RV, Inc. v.

Delivery of the vehicle may be carried out by the dealer or by a third party hired by the dealer. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-5-53; Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 28S. Dealers are required to record the terms and method of delivery on the sales invoice and maintain a copy in their records to substantiate a claim for the exemption. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 28S; see Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20170994 (Sept. 26, 2018) (sales invoice or purchase order which lists the delivery terms are sufficient, a non-invoice form is not); Indiana Supplemental Letters of Findings 04-20180003 and 04-20180004 (May 2, 2018) (sales tax assessed where dealer could not provide documentation of out-of-state delivery); Indiana Letters of Findings 04-20160712 and 04-20160713 (Feb. 28, 2018) (sales tax assessed on motor vehicle sales for which dealer could not provide documentation proving the vehicles were delivered outside Indiana). Sales of motor vehicles (or any tangible personal property) delivered to the purchaser in a state other than Indiana for use in a state other than Indiana are not subject to gross retail tax or use tax, provided the property is not intended to be subsequently used in Indiana. Ind. Code Ann. §2.2-5-54(b). Effective July 1, 2017, cargo trailers and recreational vehicles purchased by a nonresident that will be transported out of Indiana within 30 days of delivery and titled and registered in another state or country are subject to tax at the rate of the destination state or country. Prior to July 1, 2017, cargo trailers and recreational vehicles were taxable at the general rate. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-2-4, as added by 2017 Ind. S.B. 172, effective July 1, 2017; Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 72. “Storage” means the keeping or retention of tangible personal property in Indiana for any purpose except temporary storage. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-3-1(b), as amended by 2015 Ind. H.B. 1472, §6, effective Jan. 1, 2016; see also Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-3-2., repealed by Indiana Register, Final Rule #16-570(F), effective Oct. 6, 2017. The phrase “temporary storage”means the keeping or retention of tangible personal property in Indiana for a period of not more than 180 days and only for the purpose of the subsequent use of that property solely outside of Indiana. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-3-1(d), as amended by 2015 Ind. H.B. 1472, §6, effective Jan. 1, 2016. “Motor Vehicle” Defined “Motor vehicle” means a vehicle that would be subject to the annual license excise tax imposed under Ind. Code Ann. §6-6-5-0.5, et seq., if the vehicle is used in Indiana. However, trailers do not meet the definition of “motor vehicle” and are not subject to the motor vehicle tax. Indiana Revenue Ruling 2014-09ST (April 7, 2015) (taxpayer was not required to collect sales tax at the rate of its customer's base state or complete Form ST-108, because a “trailer”is not considered a “motor vehicle”). If a taxpayer purchases a motor vehicle and splices a trailer into the motor vehicle, and then sells the converted motor vehicle, the taxpayer is selling a motor vehicle and the sale is subject to motor vehicle tax. Indiana Revenue Ruling 2014-09ST (April 7, 2015). For more information, see the Excise Tax Navigator, at Indiana 9.7. Cargo Trailers and Recreational Vehicles A “recreational vehicle” is a vehicle with or without motive power equipped exclusively for living quarters for persons traveling upon the highways. Travel trailers, motor homes, truck campers with floors and facilities enabling them to be used as dwellings, and fifth wheel trailers are all considered “recreational vehicles.” Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-39(b). A “cargo trailer” is a vehicle:• without motive power; • designed for carrying property; • designed for being drawn by a motor vehicle; and • having a gross vehicle weight rating of at least 2,200 pounds. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-39(a). Sales of cargo trailers and recreational vehicles are exempt from Indiana sales tax if:• the purchaser is a nonresident; • within 30 days of receiving delivery of the cargo trailer or recreational vehicle, the purchaser transports it out of Indiana; • the cargo trailer or recreational vehicle will be titled or registered for use in another state or country, and not in Indiana; and • the state or country in which the cargo trailer or recreational vehicle will be titled or registered provides a reciprocal exemption from sales, use, or similar taxes for cargo trailers and recreational vehicles purchased by Indiana residents that will be titled or registered in Indiana. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-39(c); Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 72; see Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20140200 (Jan. 28, 2015) (a recreational vehicle dealer that did not retain sales invoices or purchase orders to establish out-of-state delivery failed to prove eligibility for the exemption). The Indiana Department of Revenue is authorized to enter into such reciprocity agreements with other states regarding sales cargo trailers and recreational vehicles. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-10-6, as added by 2017 Ind. S.B. 172, effective July 1, 2017. A list of states and countries that provide reciprocal exemptions is available in Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 72. Taxpayers should also independently confirm the reciprocal exemptions for each state and country. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 72; Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 28S. After June 30, 2017, and prior to July 1, 2019, if a cargo trailer or recreational vehicle is purchased in Indiana by a nonresident for use outside Indiana, and the purchase does not qualify for exemption, the state sales tax rate on the transaction will be the same as the other state or country where the cargo trailer or recreational vehicle will be titled or registered, provided that:• the purchaser intends to transport the cargo trailer or recreational vehicle outside Indiana within 30 days after delivery; • the purchaser intends to title or register the cargo trailer or recreational vehicle for use in that other state or country; and • the cargo trailer or recreational vehicle will not be titled or registered for use in Indiana. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-2-4(c), as added by 2017 Ind. S.B. 172, effective July 1, 2017 and expiring June 20, 2019; Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 72. This provision applies only to state (or country)tax rates, and does not include any locally imposed tax rates. In order to qualify for the alternate tax rate, the seller and purchaser of the cargo trailer or recreational vehicle must certify the following information in an affidavit:• the name of the state or country in which the cargo trailer or recreational vehicle will be titled or registered; • an affirmation by the purchasers under the penalty of perjury that the information contained in the affidavit is true; and • any other information required by the department. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-2-4(d), as added by 2017 Ind. S.B. 172, effective July 1, 2017 and expiring June 20, 2019; Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 72. Sales at Auction Sales of vehicles or trailers by a licensed auction company or auctioneer are subject to Indiana sales tax if the auction is conducted at a site owned, leased, or provided by the auction house or auctioneer. All sales are subject to tax unless the purchaser provides a valid exemption form. If an auction house or auctioneer sells motor vehicles and a purchaser will transport and title or register a vehicle for use outside of Indiana within 30 days after delivery, the purchaser and auction house or auctioneer must complete form ST- 108NR in order to charge the sales or use tax rate for the destination state or country. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 20; Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20170160 (Jan. 31, 2018) (auctioneer liable for tax on motor vehicle auctions); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20150448 (Aug. 30, 2017) (where a towing company conducts auctions of motor vehicles it towed and upon which it subsequently placed mechanics liens, the towing company is responsible for collecting sales and use tax on the sales). Promotional Motor Vehicles and Motor Vehicle Give-aways In Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20150315, the Indiana Department of Revenue addressed a situation in which a casino purchased several cars at retail and used them to promote its business by giving them as in promotional ”give-away drawings.”The casino asserted that it merely paid the car dealerships for the vehicles that the dealership worked directly with the customer regarding delivery. Thus, the casino asserted that it was not liable for tax on the vehicles that it gave away. However, the department determined that the casino did in fact purchase the cars, so it was responsible for tax. Because the casino did not pay sales tax when it purchased the cars, it was responsible for use tax on the cars. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20150315 (May 25, 2016). Related Party Transactions A transaction involving a motor vehicle is exempt from the state gross retail tax if the transaction consists of changing the motor vehicle title to add or delete an individual, and the individual being added or deleted is the spouse, child, grandparent, parent, or sibling of an owner. Ind. Code Ann. § 6-2.5-5-15.5. Racing Engines Racing engines and chassis are exempt from tax. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-37. Additionally, all spare, replacement, and rebuilding parts or components for the engines and chassis are exempt. Motor Vehicle Leasing The lease or rental of a motor vehicle is subject to sales and use tax if the motor vehicle is primarily located in Indiana. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-4-10(a); Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-1-5; Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 28L; Indiana Letter of Findings 09-0727 (Dec. 22, 2010) (wholesaler's truck lease subject to tax, fails to prove assigned to new carrier). “Lease or rental” means any transfer of possession or control of a motor vehicle for a fixed or indeterminate term for consideration, including any future option to purchase a motor vehicle or extend the lease or rental. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-1-5-21(a). Additionally, “lease or rental includes”agreements covering motor vehicles and trailers in which the amount of consideration may be increased or decreased by reference to the amount realized upon sale or disposition of the property as defined under 26 U.S.C. §7701(h)(1). Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-1-5-21(b). The lease payment subject to tax is based on the amount of the actual lease receipts. Actual lease receipts are defined as the gross receipts from the rental or lease of tangible personal property without any deduction for expenses or costs incidental to the conduct of the business. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-4-27(d); Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 28L. Tax is based upon retail income received by the lessor, not the amounts paid by the lessee. For instance, a manufacturer's rebate based upon the lease of a vehicle is included in the tax base and subject to tax. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-1-5; Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 28L. Each payment period is considered a complete transaction. Consequently, the tax is calculated and payable on each periodic payment, whether it is monthly or some other period. The exercise of any option contained within a rental or lease agreement is included in taxable gross receipts. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-4-27(d); Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 28L. Additionally, lease or rental includes agreements covering motor vehicles and trailers in which the amount of consideration may be increased or decreased by reference to the amount realized upon sale or disposition of the property as defined under 26 U.S.C. §7701(h)(1). Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-1-21(b). Trade-Ins Indiana allows for a deduction in the taxable gross retail income of the lessor for like kind exchanges of motor vehicles or trailers traded in providing such trade in is owned and titled in the name of the purchaser. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-38.2; Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 28L; Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 28S. In the context of leasing a motor vehicle or trailer, a “like kind exchange” means a motor vehicle or trailer traded for another motor vehicle or trailer. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-1-6; Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 28L; Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 28S. However, a “like kind exchange” does not include the a motor vehicle traded for a recreational vehicle as they have distinctly different purposes and are used for different purposes. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-1-6; Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20160434 (Aug. 30, 2017). When the motor vehicle traded in is encumbered, the customer's net equity in the vehicle reduces the taxable gross retail income of the lessor. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-38.2; Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 28L; Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 28S. This is true even where the customer has negative equity in the trade in vehicle. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 28L (explaining that the amount of negative equity that is built into a series of lease payments is deductible evenly over the duration of the lease); Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 28S. Lease or rental does not include the transfer of possession or control of a motor vehicle under a security agreement or deferred payment plan that requires the transfer of title upon completion of the required payment. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-1-21(a)(1). Withdrawals from Inventory Motor vehicles withdrawn from inventory and used by a dealership's employees or by the dealership's customers(e.g., as loaners) are subject to use tax if sales tax was not paid at the time the vehicles were acquired. Indiana Letters of Findings 04-20160712 and 04-20160713 (Feb. 28, 2018) (vehicles used and depreciated as “capital assets”subject to use tax). Vehicles used as demonstrators are also subject to use tax, based on the number of miles the vehicle is used as a demonstrator. For more information on motor vehicle demonstrators, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Indiana 29.3.8. Volkswagen Buyback Program A buyback amount received by an affected owner pursuant to the settlement program that the owner then applies toward the purchase of another Volkswagen vehicle cannot be used as a trade-in credit. Indiana Final Order 04-20170526R (Nov. 29, 2017). Nominal Purchase Price The transfer of possession or control of property under an agreement that requires the transfer of title upon completion of required payments and payment of an option price that does not exceed the greater of $100 or 1 percent of the total required payments is not a lease, but rather a sale. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-1-21(a)(2). Therefore, tax is due at the inception of the lease on the sum of all lease payments rather than on each periodic payment. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-1-21(a). Any leasing or renting of a vehicle, with or without an operator, is not subject to gross retail tax or use tax regardless of whether control is exercised, if the leased or rented vehicle is directly used in providing public transportation. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-4-27(d). Documentation Fees Effective July 1, 2016, dealers may charge a separate “convenience fee” for performing the services that have historically been excluded from the retail unitary transaction and represented by “documentation fees.” As such, fees that meet the definition of a separately stated “convenience fee” are not subject to sales tax. While dealers may still charge a separate documentation fee in addition to a convenience fee, the services attributable to documentation fees will be considered to be charges by the seller for services necessary to complete the sale and included in the sales tax base. Prior to July 1, 2016, dealers could charge separately stated “documentation fees” and exclude them from the sales tax base. These fees were presumed to be considered compensation for the service of preparing and submitting documents to the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles.

Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Motor Vehicles, Intrastate or Non-Commercial Use Repair and Replacement Parts

Taxable Motor vehicle repair and replacement parts are subject to sales and use tax. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-4-2(c). When a dealer provides a vehicle to use while a car is being repaired under the conditions of warranty, the furnishing of the vehicle is not part of the repair or replacement parts and the charge for the vehicle is subject to sales or use tax. If the warranty explicitly states a rental vehicle will be provided while the warranty work is being performed the rental transaction is not subject to sales or use tax only if there is written documentation of payment from the warranty provider.

Depends Short-term rentals of tangible personal property other than a new motor vehicle are exempt from the state's gross retail tax if the person acquiring the property acquires it for resale, rental, or for a business purpose lease. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-8; see also Indiana Letter of Findings 03-0097. A transaction involving a new motor vehicle is exempt from the state gross retail tax when a person acquires a new motor vehicle for rental or leasing in the ordinary course of the person's business as a rental company. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-8, as amended by 2019 Ind. H.B. 1001, effective July 1, 2019; Ind. Code Ann. §24-4-9-7 (definition of a rental company).

Topic: Transportation Property, Fuel, Services Motor Vehicles, Interstate and Common Carrier Purchase, Lease, or Rental Transactions

Depends Motor vehicles used in interstate commerce or as common carriers will likely be considered public transportation property and therefore exempt from gross retail tax. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-27; Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 12. To qualify as public transportation property, the motor vehicles must be used predominantly in public transportation. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-5-27; Klink Trucking, Inc. v. Indiana Dept. of Rev., 79 N.E.3d 1029, 2017 BL 249795 (Ind. Tax Ct. 2017) (where the department uses estimates, inferences, and assumptions in an item-by-item methodology to calculate predominant use, the taxpayer's use of income-based methodology of predominant use will prevail); Indiana Final Order 04-20170227R (Jan. 31, 2018) (packaging and shipping supplies did not qualify for public transportation exemption because such items were not used or consumed in providing the transportation); Indiana Supplemental Letter of Findings 04-20170528 (Feb. 28, 2018) (taxpayer's documentation was insufficient to establish that vehicles were predominantly used in public transportation). “Public transportation”means the movement, transportation, or carrying of persons or property for consideration by a common carrier, contract carrier, household goods carrier, carriers of exempt commodities, and other specialized carriers performing public transportation services for compensation by highway, rail, air, or water. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-5-61(b). For a company to be considered engaged in public transportation, the following requirements must be met:• the company must transport persons or the property of others; Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20160012 (July 26, 2017) (taxpayer providing hazardous waste treatment services failed to establish that its purchases of tires and truck parts and rental of dump trailer were for direct and predominant use in transporting property of others for consideration); Indiana Supplemental Letter of Findings 04-20170528 (Feb. 28, 2018) (same). • the company must maintain all shipping/transporting documents for all transactions (e.g., trip reports, truck logs, and invoices); • the company must hold and pay for public transportation insurance; • the company must receive compensation for the transportation services provided; • the company must be authorized to provide public transportation services; • in a situation where an employee provides services for both the parent company and leased duties for a transportation company, the parent company must maintain records detailing which party the employee was providing services to; • if the parent company makes a capital contribution of the vehicles, title to the vehicles must transfer to the transportation company; • the parent company and transportation company must maintain separate books and records, including separate charts of accounts for: transactions between the entities showing the actual invoicing and payments for every transaction; and each entity's segregated and accounted for purchases and expenses; and • the entities must have an arm's-length relationship including separate incomes and expenses for separate federal income tax filings. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 12. See Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20160352 (Nov. 30, 2016) (taxpayer's purchase of vacuum trucks used more than 50 percent of the time to provide public transportation of waste materials that it did not own, was exempt from sales tax; however, other purchases were taxable). Possession of a Department of Transportation number or other registration does not of itself mean the company is engaged in public transportation. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20170769 (July 26, 2017). A key factor in determining whether the entities have an arm's-length relationship is whether or not the transportation services are being paid for. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20170176 (Aug. 30, 2017) (where a taxpayer leased employees from a company for whom it makes deliveries, and that company only covers direct costs incurred by the taxpayer, the taxpayer has failed to show that consideration is being exchanged, such that the entities do not have an arms length relationship). If the parent company or other related entity pays the transportation company for the transportation services, it supports a finding that there is an arm's length relationship. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20140502 (June 29, 2016) (determining whether two subsidiary companies subsidiary companies had an arm's-length relationship); see also Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20150416 (March 30, 2016) (denying an exemption because taxpayer did not provide sufficient evidence of an arm's-length relationship). In the case of related companies, where one provides public transportation of property for hire and the other provides property and services to the public transportation company, the second company is not transporting property for the public and is therefore subject to tax. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20130049 (Aug. 28, 2013). A company's purchase of vehicles for its related companies to use in public transportation does not qualify for the public transportation exemption as the purchasing company will not directly use the vehicles in providing public transportation. Schilli Leasing, Inc. v. Indiana Dept. of State Rev., No. 49T10-1306-TA-00054, 2017 BL 306991 (Ind. Tax Ct. Aug. 31, 2017). Any leasing or renting of a vehicle, with or without an operator, is not subject to gross retail tax or use tax regardless of whether control is exercised, if the leased or rented vehicle is directly used in providing public transportation. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-4-27(d). A retail merchant who obtains an exemption certificate from a person purchasing tangible personal property for use or consumption in providing public transportation is not liable for a failure to collect use tax that may be due on the storage, use, or consumption of the tangible personal property. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-3-7.5; as added by 2016 Ind. H.B. 1290, effective July 1, 2016. The lease or rental of transportation equipment is sourced the same as a retail sale. Transportation equipment means any of the following: Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-13-1(g). • trucks and truck-tractors with a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,001 pounds or greater, trailers, semitrailers, or passenger buses that are registered through the International Registration Plan and operated under the authority of a carrier authorized and certificated by the United States Department of Transportation or another federal authority to engage in the carriage of persons or property in interstate commerce; • containers designed for use on and component parts attached or secured on the locomotives, railcars, trucks, truck-tractors, trailers, semitrailers, passenger buses, and aircraft. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-13-1(g). The exemption only applies to transactions occurring in the state of Indiana, and no refunds will be awarded for related sales tax paid to another state.

Taxable Water vessels used in interstate commerce or as common carriers, will likely be considered public transportation property and therefore exempt from gross retail tax. Ind.

Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-5-61(b).
