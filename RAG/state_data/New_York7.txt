Prior to June 1, 2018, vendors who are intermediaries that connect restaurants or caterers to buyers of catering are reselling food services. However, resellers of food services must pay sales tax to the supplier at the time of purchase and then take a credit against tax which they are required to remit when the food services are sold to the final consumer. N.Y. Tax Law §1105(d); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.8(i); see New York TSB-A-15(31)S (July 16, 2015). Food and Beverages Sold by a Restaurant, Tavern, Caterer, or Cruise New York taxes sales of foods and beverages served by a restaurant, tavern, caterer, or cruise for on-site consumption or delivery unless the sale is specifically exempt. N.Y. Tax Law §1105(d); N.Y. Tax Law §1105(f); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §528.2(d); see also New York TSB-A-15(30)S (July 15, 2015) (finding that a when a party cruise company provides passengers with a meal and beverages as part of the regular cruise fee for trips around New York Harbor, the entire charge for the cruise is subject to sales tax); New York TSB-A-14(12)S (July 2, 2014) (finding that a fitness facility's sales of prepared smoothies and muscle drinks were subject to sales tax when purchasers consumed them on-site; also finding that the smoothies were taxable when consumed off-site because the facility did not sell them in the same form, condition, quantity, or packaging as grocery stores sold them). Local Taxes New York law authorizes cities and counties to impose local sales and use taxes in one of two ways. Under the first method of imposing local sales and use tax, the local sales and use tax applies to the same base as the state sales and use tax, including alcoholic beverages, subject to the same exemptions as the state tax. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(iv)(a)(1), as amended by 2019 N.Y. A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019. Under the first method of imposing local sales and use tax, the local sales and use tax applies to the same base as the state sales and use tax. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(iv)(a)(1), as amended by 2019 N.Y. A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019. Under the second method, a jurisdiction may, but is not required to, impose a tax on certain transactions that comprise the state tax base, including charges for meals. N.Y. Tax Law §1105(d)(i); N.Y. Tax Law §1210(iv)(b)(1), as amended by 2019 N.Y. A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019. The sale of food, alcoholic beverages, and any other drink by a restaurant, tavern, similar establishment, or caterer is one of the transactions that may be taxed by a local jurisdiction at its option. N.Y. Tax Law §1105(d)(i); N.Y. Tax Law §1210(iv)(b)(1), as amended by 2019 N.Y. A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019. Therefore, depending on the method chosen by a city or county, meals sold in or by restaurants, taverns, or other similar establishments may be subject to the local sales and use tax. N.Y. Tax Law §1210(iv)(a)(1), as amended by 2019 N.Y. A.B. 5246, effective May 29, 2019. However, New York law does not authorize the imposition of any other local option transaction taxes on meals sold in or by restaurants, taverns, or other similar establishments.

Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Prepared Food Definition of 'Prepared Food'

Not Defined New York does not define “prepared food” but does provide an enumerated list of items that constitute prepared food for purposes of its sales tax. See New York TB-ST-135; New York TB-ST-110. Examples of prepared food include: • hot pizza; • hot soup; • warm pretzels; • food sold from a hot buffet; • cold cut platters; • cookie platters; • salad from self-serve salad bars; • vegetable platters; • cheese platters; • fruit platters; • dessert trays; • subs and sandwiches; • sushi platters;and • ice cream served in a cone or in a sundae.

As a result, many “take-out” transactions are subject to sales tax. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.8(d). BNA-SUTN NY 11.2.2.

Any expenses incurred by the caterer for an event that are included in the overall charge to the customer are also taxable. New York TB-ST-110. Sales for Resale As of June 1, 2018, sales of otherwise taxable food and beverages by restaurants, caterers, and similar establishments can be made for resale and not subject to sales tax. N.Y. Tax Law §1105(d), as amended by 2017 N.Y. S.B. 7509, Part J, effective June 1, 2018; New York TSB-M-18(1)S (May 25, 2018). Prior to June 1, 2018, persons making purchases of taxable food and beverages from restaurants, caterers, and similar establishments needed to pay sales tax and later apply for a refund or credit of any tax paid once the items were resold. A refund or credit is still available for any tax paid on these purchases. N.Y. Tax Law §1105(d); New York TSB-M-18(1)S (May 25, 2018). Prior to June 1, 2018, vendors who are intermediaries that connect restaurants or caterers to buyers of catering are reselling food services. However, resellers of food services must pay sales tax to the supplier at the time of purchase and then take a credit against tax which they are required to remit when the food services are sold to the final consumer.

Prior to June 1, 2018, purchases of prepared food (such as meat platters) or beverages (such as hot coffee) cannot be made without the payment of sales tax. As a result, a caterer must pay sales tax on its purchase of any taxable prepared food or beverage, even though it will also be charging sales tax to its customer on the same items. However, the caterer is eligible to take a credit on its sales tax return for the tax paid to its supplier. New York TB-ST-110. However, charges for food preparation and serving will not be subject to tax if a separate legal entity is contracted to provide the services without being dominated and controlled by the entity that is selling the food. Tax will still apply to the sales of food by the second entity. New York TSB-A-14(34)S (Aug. 27, 2014). Sales of food or beverages by caterers where the caterer merely delivers the items purchased, without any other services after delivery, are considered to be sales of food or beverages for off-premises consumption and are taxed accordingly. New York TB-ST-110. Caterers and the Purchase of Services Often caterers are responsible for extra services in addition to the provision of food and beverages. When a caterer purchases a taxable service, it must pay tax to the service provider. Taxable services include:• decorating and design services; • parking services; • security services; and • the provision portable toilets (i.e., waste-removal services). New York TB-ST-110.
