==================================================

Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Prepared Food Definition of 'Restaurant' or 'Eating Establishment'

Not Defined West Virginia does not define “restaurant” or “eating establishment.” W. Va. Code §11-15B-2; W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-2. A 6 percent tax applies to any sales of food and beverages made by restaurants and bars. W. Va. Code §11-15-3a(a); W.Va. Code R. tit. 110, §110-15-91.1. Bars and restaurants are responsible for paying sales or use tax on all purchases made for use in the establishment, except purchases qualifying for exemption as purchases for resale. Such purchases qualifying for the resale exemption include food, as defined above, and items primarily intended to be transferred to a customer as part of the purchase, such as food containers, straws, napkins, and disposable cutlery.

==================================================

Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Prepared Food Prepared Food Items Sold With Eating Utensils Provided by Seller

Taxable Sales of prepared food items with eating utensils provided by seller are taxable at a rate of 6 percent. W. Va. Code §11-15-3a(a); West Virginia Publication TSD-419 (Aug. 2013); Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Taxability Matrix, West Virginia (version 2018.0). The Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board has adopted a 75 percent threshold test to determine when utensils are provided by a seller, and thus when a sale is a taxable sale of prepared food. In calculating the ratio, the numerator is determined by adding the sales of prepared food with the number of sales in which utensils, plates, bowls, cups, cutlery, are necessary to receive the food. Sales of alcoholic beverages are not included in the numerator. The denominator includes all sales of food and food ingredients, as well as prepared food, candy, soft drinks, and dietary supplements. Again, sales of alcohol are not included. W. Va. Code §11-15B-2(b)(40)(A); West Virginia Publication TSD-420 (Jan. 2012). If, after the calculation is complete, the ratio is 75 percent or less, utensils are considered provided to the customer only when it is the vendor's practice to physically give, hand, or otherwise deliver, the utensils to the customer. The vendor's practice is determined by accepting a good faith representation from the vendor. If, after the calculation is complete, the ratio is greater than 75 percent, utensils are considered to be provided so long as utensils are made available to the purchaser. W. Va. Code §11-15B-2(b)(40)(A); West Virginia Publication TSD-420 (Jan. 2012). For vendors who have a ratio of greater than 75 percent who sell items containing four or more servings packaged as one and sold for one price, the mere availability of utensils does not make such food prepared food. Rather, if the vendor provides utensils directly for use in consuming the food item, then the food is considered prepared food, and its sale is subject to tax. W. Va. Code §11-15B-2(b)(40)(A); West Virginia Publication TSD-420 (Jan. 2012). When a vendor sells food items that have utensils placed in the package by a person other than the vendor who is engaged in manufacturing, the vendor is not considered to have provided the utensils to the purchaser. Thus, the sale of food is not taxable as a sale of prepared food. W. Va. Code §11-15B-2(b)(40)(A); West Virginia Publication TSD-420 (Jan. 2012). BNA-SUTN WV 11.2.5.
