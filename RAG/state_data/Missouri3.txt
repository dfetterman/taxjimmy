Depends Generally, Missouri imposes sales and use tax on the service of providing electricity and electrical current to domestic, commercial, or industrial users subject to several exceptions. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.020.1(3); Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-108.300 Missouri provides several state tax exemptions for the sale and use of electricity including:• all sales of electricity used exclusively for drying agricultural crops or in agricultural production; Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.030.2(23); Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-110.920(3)(E). • electricity used by an eligible new generation cooperative or an eligible new generation processing entity; Mo. Rev.

Rev. Stat. §144.054.2; Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-110.601(1); Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-111.061(2). Manufacturing Use of Utilities Sales of electrical energy are exempt from state (but not local) sales tax if used or consumed in:• the manufacturing, processing, compounding, mining, or producing of any product; • the processing of recovered materials; and • the research and development related to manufacturing, processing, compounding, mining, or producing any product. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.054.2; Aquila Foreign Qualifications Corp. v. Missouri Dir. of Rev., 362 S.W.3d 1 (Mo. 2012) (a convenience store's purchase of electricity used to prepare food was not eligible for the exemption because “processing” does not include the preparation of food for retail sale). Further, electrical energy used in manufacturing will be exempt from state and local sales tax if:• the total cost of electrical energy used exceeds 10 percent of the total cost of production (exclusive of the cost of electrical energy); or • the raw materials used in such processing contain at least 25 percent recovered materials. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.030.2(13). Utilities for Cellular Glass Products All sales of electrical energy that are consumed in connection with the manufacturing of cellular glass products or in a material recovery processing plant are exempt from tax. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.030.2(32); see also Missouri Letter Ruling LR3453 (a wind turbine, which consisted of a tower, blades, nacelle, foundation, and generation equipment, was exempt from sales tax under Mo. Ann. Stat. §144.030.2(5) because it was used directly in generating electricity). Cellular glass products are not defined by Missouri authority, however, a general definition means, “[s]heets or blocks of thermal insulating material for walls and roofs made from pulverized glass that is heated with a gas-forming chemical at the flow temperature of glass.” McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific &Technical Terms, 6E (2003). Utilities Exemption for Agricultural Consumers The sale of electricity for agricultural production is exempt. Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-110.920(3)(E). Agricultural consumers are considered a class of consumers separate from commercial, industrial, and domestic consumers and therefore there is no authority to tax the sales of utilities to agricultural consumers. Norwin G. Heimos Greenhouse Inc. v. Missouri Dir. of Rev., 724 S.W.2d 505 (Mo. 1987) (superseded by Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.190 on the issue of limiting persons who can request a sales tax to “the person legally obligated to remit the tax”).

Rev. Stat. §144.030.2(34). and • prescription pharmaceuticals consumed by humans or animals. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.030.2(34). Domestic Utilities Exemption Sales of electricity is exempt from state tax, but not local tax, when purchased for domestic, noncommercial use in a residence. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.030.2(24); American Healthcare Mgmt. Inc. v. Missouri Dir. of Rev., 984 S.W.2d 496 (Mo. 1999). Domestic use is defined as the portion of utilities used by an individual occupant of a residential premise for nonbusiness, noncommercial, or nonindustrial purposes. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.030.2(24)(a); Missouri Letter Ruling LR7252; Missouri Letter Ruling LR7253 (utility charges for mobile-home park street-lighting were not exempt as they were used by the entire park, rather than an individual occupant). Regulated utility sellers must determine whether the purchase is exempt or nonexempt based upon the service rate classifications approved by the Missouri Public Service Commission. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.030.2(24)(b). If a person makes a purchase for domestic use, and subsequently uses a portion for nondomestic use, tax is due on the portion of the nondomestic purchases. A return must be filed by the 15th day of the fourth month following the year of purchase. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.030.2(24)(c). Local Tax Missouri law does not authorize the imposition of any special transaction taxes on utilities services. However, utilities services are subject to the local sales and use tax because the local sales and use tax applies to the same base as the state sales and use tax, which does apply to utilities services. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.020.1(3); Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-117.100.(1). A city or county may impose a sales tax on these utilities when purchased for domestic use. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.032. The purchaser of nontaxable, domestic use utility services may request the utility company to apply for a refund on the domestic portion of its utility purchases. The utility company, as the seller of utilities, has three years from the due date of its return for the period in which the domestic utilities were sold to file a claim for refund on behalf of the purchaser.

Depends Generally, Missouri imposes sales and use tax on the service of providing gas, natural or artificial, to domestic, commercial, or industrial users subject to several exceptions. Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.020.1(3); Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-108.300 Missouri provides several state tax exemptions for the sale and use of gas, including:• all sales of natural gas used for agricultural production; Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.030.2(23); Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 12, §10-110.920(3)(E). • natural gas used by an eligible new generation cooperative or an eligible new generation processing entity; Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.030.2(23). • all sales of metered natural, artificial or propane gas for domestic use; Mo. Rev. Stat. §144.030.2(24). • natural, artificial or propane gas used or consumed in the manufacturing process, or used in the processing of recovered materials or in research and development related to manufacturing; Mo.
