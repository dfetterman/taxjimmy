Local Tax Authorized In addition to the state sales and use tax, North Dakota law allows cities and counties to impose local sales, use and gross receipt taxes, lodging taxes, lodging and restaurant taxes, and motor vehicle taxes. N.D. Cent. Code § 11-09.1-01; N.D. Cent. Code § 40-05.1-06; N.D. Cent. Code §40-57.3-01; N.D. Cent. Code § 57-01-02.1(1); N.D. Cent. Code § 57-39.4-02. North Dakota has authorized both cities and counties within the state to enact local sales and use taxes under their home rule charter, without limitation on the rate. N.D. Cent. Code §11-09.1-05(2); N.D. Cent. Code §40-05.1-06(2); N.D. Cent. Code §40-05.1-06(16). However, local option taxes imposed under a city or county's home rule charter must be imposed on the same items and provide the same exemptions as the state sales and use tax. N.D. Cent. Code §11-09-1-05(2)(a); N.D. Cent. Code §40-05.1-06(16)(a); see N.D. Cent. Code §57-39.2-01, et seq.; N.D. Cent. Code §57-40.2-01, et seq. Any jurisdiction enacting this tax does not have to enact both the sales and use tax, and may elect to only enact a sales tax. North Dakota Guideline—Sales, Use and Gross Receipts Tax Requirements (Jan. 2012); North Dakota Guideline—Local Option Taxes by Location, effective Jan. 1, 2016. To date, most locations that impose a local option sales tax also impose a local option use tax. North Dakota Guideline—Sales, Use and Gross Receipts Tax Requirements (Jan. 2012) (Bisbee, Cando and Scranton are the only cities as of Jan. 1, 2017 that impose a local option sales tax without a corresponding local option use tax). However, cities such as Bisbee, Cando and Scranton impose a local sales tax only. Local sales tax in the cities of Bisbee, Cando, and Scranton applies only if the seller and buyer are located within the city limits of these cities. North Dakota Guideline—Local Option Taxes by Location, effective Jan. 1, 2016. Similarly, in other local jurisdictions where city has enacted a sales tax but not a corresponding use tax, the business or buyer must be located in the locality to be affected by local taxes. Natl.

Code §40-05.1-06(2); N.D. Cent. Code §40-05.1-06(16); North Dakota Guideline—Local Option Taxes by Location, effective Jan. 1, 2016.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Historical Information

Est. 1935 North Dakota first enacted sales tax in 1935. It was initially enacted at a rate of 2 percent. North Dakota 2014 State and Local Tax Guide (Dec. 2014). Four years later, in 1939, North Dakota enacted a corresponding 2-percent use tax. The sales and use tax rate increased from 2 percent to 2.25 percent in 1963. However, in 1965 the sales tax law was referred and disapproved and use tax was collected in place of sales tax from 1965-1967. In 1967, new sales and use tax laws were enacted setting the rate for both sales and use tax at 3 percent. In years following the reenactment of the sales tax, the rate of sales and use tax was reduced and increased frequently. In addition, numerous pieces of legislation were also enacted carving our exemptions from taxation for certain items and services and applying special rates to certain forms of property subject to sales and use tax.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Pending and Trending Developments

Economic Nexus North Dakota is the birthplace of Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, a landmark case wherein the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that a business must have physical presence in a taxing state in order to be liable for collection of sales tax from retail sales made to the taxing state's residents. Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 298 (1992), overruled in part by South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., 138 S. Ct. 2080, 2018 BL 219995 (U.S. 2018). With the passage of time, several states have attempted to avoid Quill's limitations on their ability to require out-of-state sellers to collect sales tax by enacting legislation establishing monetary thresholds, implementing incentive programs, or offering vendor discounts. Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 298 (1992), overruled in part by South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., 138 S. Ct. 2080, 2018 BL 219995 (U.S. 2018). Economic Nexus North Dakota has also passed legislation requiring out-of-state vendors who make more than $100,000 of sales or 200 or more separate sales transactions delivered into North Dakota in a calendar year to collect and remit sales tax. The North Dakota State Tax Commission has indicated that this provision became effective upon the release of the decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc.. Enforcement of the statute began Oct. 1, 2018, and any out-of-state retailers who meet North Dakota's economic nexus threshold must begin collecting sales tax by that date or 60 days after they meet the threshold, whichever is later.
