Destination As a full member of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, North Carolina follows the streamlined sourcing provisions which are destination-based, in general. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4B. Pursuant to statute and in compliance with the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, (SSUTA), the sale of a product, regardless of the nature of the product, except as otherwise noted, is sourced as follows: • Over-the-Counter. When a purchaser receives a product at a business location of the seller, the sale is sourced to that business location. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4B(a)(1). • Delivery to Specified Address. When a purchaser or purchaser's donee receives a product at a location specified by the purchaser and the location is not a business location of the seller, the sale is sourced to the location where the purchaser or the purchaser's donee receives the product. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4B(a)(2). • Delivery Address Unknown. When a seller of a product does not know the address where a product is received, the sale is sourced to the location indicated by an address for the purchaser that is available from the business records of the seller that are maintained in the ordinary course of the seller's business. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4B(a)(3). If an address is not available from the seller's business records, the sale is sourced to the location indicated by an address for the purchaser obtained during the consummation of the sale, including the address of a purchaser's payment instrument, if no other address is available. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4B(a)(4). • Other Circumstances or Insufficient Information. Where the above-listed rules do not apply, or the seller does not have sufficient information with which to apply the rules, the location of the sale will be determined based on: a) the address from which the property is shipped; or b)the address from which the digital good or the computer software delivered electronically was first available for transmission by the seller;or c) the address from which the service was provided. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4B(a)(5). Transportation Equipment. For leased or rented transportation equipment for which recurring periodic payments are due, all payments are sourced in accordance with the general principles set out for sales of tangible personal property under N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4B(a). N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4B(b)(3). The term “transportation equipment”means any of the following items, when that item is used to carry persons or property in interstate commerce, including a container designed for use on the equipment and a component part of the equipment:• a locomotive; • a railway car; • a commercial motor vehicle as defined in N.C. Gen. Stat. §20-4.01;and • an aircraft. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4B(c). For a railway car that is leased or rented by a utility company and that would be transportation equipment if it were used in interstate commerce, all payments are sourced in accordance with the general principles set out for sales of tangible personal property under N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4B(a). N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4B(b)(4). Florist Wire Sale. A florist wire sale is sourced to the business location of the florist that takes an order for the sale (essentially, origin-based sourcing). A “florist wire sale” is a sale in which a retail florist takes a customer's order and transmits the order to another retail florist to be filled and delivered. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4B(d)(3). Direct Mail. For North Carolina's sourcing rules for direct mail sales, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at North Carolina 23.6. Digital Property North Carolina imposes a privilege tax on certain digital property delivered electronically, that would be taxed if delivered in a tangible medium, including: audio works; audiovisual works; books, magazines, newspapers, newsletters, reports, or other publications; and photographs or greeting cards. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4(6b); North Carolina Important Notice: Sourcing For Certain Digital Property Subject To Sales And Use Tax (August 2013). Sales of digital property are sourced as follows:• When a purchaser receives digital property at a business location of the seller, the sale is sourced to the business location. • When a purchaser or purchaser's donee receives digital property at a location specified by the purchaser and the location is not a business location of the seller, the sale is sourced to the location where the purchaser or purchaser's donee receives the product. • When(1) and (2) do not apply, the sale of digital property is sourced to the location indicated by an address for the purchaser that is available from the business records of the seller that are maintained in the ordinary course of the seller's business when use of this address does not constitute bad faith. • When(1), (2), and (3) do not apply, the sale of digital property is sourced to the location indicated by an address for the purchaser obtained during the consummation of the sale, including the address of a purchaser's payment instrument, if no other address is available, which use of this address does not constitute bad faith. • When(1), (2), (3), and (4) do not apply, including the circumstance in which the seller is without sufficient information to apply the rules, the location will be determined based on the address from which the digital good was first available for transmission by the seller. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4B(a); North Carolina Important Notice: Sourcing For Certain Digital Property Subject To Sales And Use Tax (August 2013). A purchaser receives digital property when the purchaser takes possession of the property or makes first use of the property, whichever comes first. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4B(f).

Destination Repair, maintenance, and installation services performed on tangible personal property are sourced where the customer can potentially make first use of the property on which the seller performed the services. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4B(a), as amended by 2017 N.C. S.B. 628, effective Jan. 1, 2017; North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Form E-505 (09-17); North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Directive SD-16-2 (Feb. 5, 2016; revised Dec. 22, 2016). Generally, this is the location where the property is returned to the purchaser. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4B(a), as amended by 2017 N.C. S.B. 628, effective Jan. 1, 2017; North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Directive SD-16-2 (Feb. 5, 2016; revised Dec. 22, 2016). Service Contract Renewals for Prewritten Software Sourcing the renewal of a service contract for prewritten computer software to an address where the purchaser received the underlying prewritten software does not constitute bad faith provided the seller has not received information from the purchaser that indicates a change in the location of the underlying software. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4B(a)(i), as added by 2018 N.C. S. 99, effective June 12, 2018; North Carolina Important Notice: Principles of Sourcing the Renewal of a Service Contract for Prewritten Computer Software (Sept. 10, 2018). Sourcing Telecommunication Services Telecommunications service means the electronic transmission, conveyance, or routing of voice, data, audio, video or any other information or signals to a point, or between or among points. Telecommunications service includes any transmission, conveyance, or routing in which a computer processing application is used to act on the form, code, or protocol of the content for purposes of the transmission, conveyance, or routing, regardless of whether it is referred to as voice-over Internet protocol or the Federal Communications Commission classifies it as enhanced or value added. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.3(48). The following general sourcing principles apply to sales of telecommunication services:• Sourcing Flat Rate Monthly Charge. A telecommunication service that is not sold on a call-by-call basis is sourced to North Carolina if the place of primary use is in North Carolina. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4C(a1)(1). The place of primary use is the street address that is representative of the location where the use of a customer's telecommunications service primarily occurs. The street address must be the customer's residential street address or primary business street address. For mobile telecommunication service, the street address must be within the licensed service area of the service provider. If a customer who contracted with a telecommunications provider for service is not an end user of the service, the end user is considered the customer for the purpose of determining the place of primary use. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.3(26a). • Sourcing Calls Billed on a Call-by-Call Basis. Call-by-call basis is a method of charging for telecommunication service for which the price of the service is measured by individual calls. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4C(h)(1). A telecommunication service that is sold on a call-by-call basis and is not a postpaid calling service is sourced to North Carolina in the following circumstances: • when a call both originates and terminates in North Carolina; N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4C(a1)(2)(a). or • when a call either originates or terminates in North Carolina and the telecommunications equipment from which the call originates or terminates and to which the call is charged is located in North Carolina. This applies regardless of where the call is billed or paid. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4C(a1)(2)(b). • Sourcing of Postpaid Calls. A postpaid calling service is a telecommunications service that is charged on a call-by-call basis, and is obtained by making payment at the time of the call either through the use of a credit of payment mechanism, such as a bank card, travel card, credit card, or debit card, or by charging the call to a telephone number that is not associated with the origination or termination of the telecommunication service. Postpaid calling service includes a service that meets all the requirements of a prepaid wireline telephone calling service, except the exclusive use requirement. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4C(h)(5). A postpaid calling service is sourced to the location of origination point of the telecommunications signal as first identified by either the seller's telecommunication system or, if the system used to transport the signal is not the seller's system, then by information the seller receives from its service provider. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4C(a1)(3). • Sourcing of Mobile Telecommunications. Sales of mobile telecommunications service are sourced to the place of primary use, unless the service is prepaid wireless calling service, or is air-to-ground radiotelephone service. Air-to-ground radiotelephone service is a postpaid calling service offered by an aircraft common carrier to passengers on its aircraft and enables a telephone call to be made from the aircraft. This sourcing principle applies to services that are provided as an adjunct to mobile telecommunications service if charges for the services are included within the meaning of the term “charges for mobile telecommunications services” under the federal Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act. Exceptions to General Sourcing Principles of Telecommunication Services Various telecommunication services and products are sourced using sourcing rules different from those that are generally applied to sales of telecommunications services. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4C(a2). Mobile telecommunications services are radio communication services carried on between mobile stations or receivers and land stations and by mobile stations communicating among themselves, and include the following:• both one-way and two-way radio communication services; N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.3(21)(a). • prepaid telephone calling services also are not sourced using the general principles applying to sales of telecommunications services. Prepaid telephone calling services are sourced by the general sourcing principles governing sales and use tax for tangible personal property; N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4C(a2)(1). • private telecommunications services are sourced in North Carolina if all of the customer's channel termination points are located in North Carolina. If all of a customer's channel termination points are not located in North Carolina and the service is billed on the basis of channel termination points, the charge for each channel termination point located in North Carolina. If none of a customer's channel termination points are located in North Carolina and the service is billed on the basis of channel mileage, then a charge for a channel segment between two channel termination points located in North Carolina is sourced to North Carolina, and 50 percent of a charge for a channel segment between a channel termination point located in North Carolina and a channel termination point located in another state is sourced to North Carolina. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4C(e). Sourcing Bundled Telecommunications Services When a taxable telecommunications service is bundled with a service that is not taxable, the tax applies to the gross receipts from the taxable service in the bundle in the following manner:• If a service provider offers all the services in the bundle on an unbundled basis, tax is due on the unbundled price of the taxable service, less the discount resulting from the bundling. A discount for a service as the result of bundling is the proportionate price decrease of the service, determined on the basis of the total unbundled price of all the services in the bundle compared to the bundled price of the services. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4D. • If a service provider does not offer one or more of the services in the bundle on an unbundled basis, tax is due on the taxable service based on a reasonable allocation of revenue to that service. If the service provider maintains an account for revenue from a taxable service, the service provider's allocation of revenue to that service for the purpose of determining the tax due on the service must reflect its accounting allocation of revenue to that service. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4D. BNA-SUTN NC 4.1.2.

When a lease or rental agreement requires recurring periodic payments, the payments are sourced as set forth below. • For leased or rented property, the first payment is sourced according to the general sourcing principles provided in N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4B(a), and each subsequent payment is sourced to the primary location of the leased or rented property for the period covered by the payment. This applies to all property except motor vehicles, aircraft, transportation equipment, and utility company railway cars. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4B(b)(1). • For leased or rented property that is a motor vehicle or an aircraft but is not transportation equipment, all payments are sourced to the primary location of the leased or rented property for the period covered by the payment. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4B(b)(2). • For leased or rented transportation equipment, all payments are sourced according to the general sourcing principles provided in N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4B(a). N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4B(b)(3). • For a railway car that is leased or rented by a utility company and would be transportation equipment if it were used in interstate commerce, all payments are sourced according to the principles set out in subsection N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4B(a). N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4B(b)(4). No Recurring Periodic Payments For leases or rentals that do not require recurring periodic payments, the payments are sourced:• to the business location for over-the-counter sales; • to the location where the purchaser receives the product providing the location is specified by the purchaser and is not the seller's business location; or • when the delivery address is unknown, the sale is sourced to the first address or location listed below known to the seller; • the business or home address of the purchaser; • the billing address of the purchaser; or • the address from which the tangible personal property was shipped or from which the service was provided.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Credit for Tax Paid to Another Jurisdiction

Yes North Carolina generally allows a credit against its use tax for the amount of sales and use tax due and paid to another state. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.6(c); Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Taxability Matrix, North Carolina (version 2018.0). The credit is applied to similar taxes; thus, if a jurisdiction has both state and local sales or use taxes, then credits for state sales or use taxes may only be applied against state taxes and credits for local sales or use taxes may only be applied against local taxes. Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Taxability Matrix, North Carolina (version 2018.0). If the amount of tax paid to the other state is less than the amount of North Carolina use tax that would be imposed, the difference is payable to North Carolina. The credit only applies when the other state where the tax was paid provides a reciprocal credit. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.6(c); Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Taxability Matrix, North Carolina (version 2018.0); North Carolina Sales and Use Tax Bulletin Section 1. A credit also is allowed for sales and use tax paid to another state by a person who sells a modular home at retail, on tangible personal property that is incorporated into the modular home. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.4(1a)(b). BNA-SUTN NC 4.2.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Temporary Presence, In-Transit Property Tangible Personal Property Purchased for Use Out-of-state

Exempt The sale of tangible personal property in North Carolina that is delivered outside the state is not subject to state and local sales or use tax, provided the property is not returned to a point within the state. N.C. Admin. Code tit. 17, r. 7B.1301. The sale of tangible personal property in North Carolina that is delivered outside the state is not subject to state and local sales or use tax, provided the property is not returned to a point within the state. The vendor must furnish acceptable proof of transportation and delivery of the property outside the state, including any of the following:• a waybill of bill of lading made out the seller's order calling for delivery; • an insurance or registry receipt issued by the U.S. Postal Service; or • a trip sheet signed by the seller's delivery agent showing the signature and address of the person who received the delivered goods outside the state. N.C. Admin. Code tit. 17, r. 7B.1301. Donees If, at the direction of the purchaser, a North Carolina retailer delivers purchased goods to the purchaser's donee to a location outside the state, sales and use tax does not apply to the transaction. If, however, the retailer delivers tangible personal property to the purchaser's donee inside the state, the sale is subject to the applicable state and local sales tax. A retailer who, at the direction of the purchaser, delivers property to the purchaser's donee outside the state, must retain acceptable proof of delivery. N.C. Admin. Code tit. 17, r. 7B.1303. Vessels North Carolina exempts from sales and use tax sales of fuel or other tangible personal property for use or consumption by or on ocean-going vessels that ply the high seas in interstate or foreign commerce in the transport of freight or passengers for hire exclusively, when delivered to an officer or agent of such vessel for the use of such vessel. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.13(24). Export to Foreign Country North Carolina provides an exemption for the sale of tangible personal property purchased solely of export to a foreign country for exclusive use or consumption in a foreign country: 1) either in the direct performance or rendition of professional or commercial services, which are actually consummated; or 2) in the direct conduct or operation of a trade or business, which is actually consummated; or 3) if purchased by the government of a foreign country for export providing the property is actually exported. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.13(33). The seller must provide an affidavit to the seller indicating compliance with the terms and conditions of the exemption, and the seller must retain such affidavit as evidence that the transaction qualifies for the exemption. The purchaser is liable for the tax, and any applicable penalties and interest, if the purposes qualifying the property for exemption are not consummated. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.13(33). If tangible personal property qualifying for the export exemption under N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.13(33) is not exported within 90 days of purchase, the property loses the exemption and is subject to applicable state and local tax use tax payable directly to the department of revenue.

Export includes possessing and marshalling property by the seller or the purchaser for transportation to a foreign country, but does not include any other use of the property in North Carolina or in the United States. The term “foreign country” does not include any U.S. territory or possession. N.C. Gen. Stat. §105-164.13(33).
