Topic: Administration and Procedure Vendor/Seller Registration

Required Every taxpayer making retail sales or rentals of tangible personal property or furnishing taxable services at retail in Wisconsin is required to obtain a seller's permit for each business location within the state, unless the seller is exempt from taxation. Wis. Stat. §77.52(7)(a); Wis. Stat. §77.52(12); Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.002(2)(a). If an owner elects under Wis. Stat. §77.58(3)(a) to file a separate electronic use tax return for each of the owner's disregarded entities, each disregarded entity is considered an applicant for the purposes of obtaining a seller's permit. Wis. Stat. §77.52(7)(a), as amended by 2015 Wis. S.B. 440, §55, effective March 3, 2016; Wisconsin Tax Bulletin No. 119. Where a single-owner entity is disregarded as a separate entity, the seller's permit may be in the name of either the disregarded entity or its owner. Wis. Stat. §77.61(11), as amended by 2015 Wis. S.B. 440, §60, effective March 3, 2016; Wisconsin Tax Bulletin No. 119. However, not all sellers must obtain a Wisconsin seller's permit. A seller need not obtain the permit if the seller sells only tax-exempt items; or qualifies for the occasional sale exemption. Wisconsin Publication 228; Wisconsin Private Letter Ruling W 1911005 (Dec. 10, 2018). Out-of-state Retailers Every out-of-state retailer engaged in business in Wisconsin and not required to hold a seller's permit must obtain a use tax registration certificate. Wis. Stat. §77.53(9); Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.002(2)(b). Out-of-state retailers not engaged in business in the state that elect to collect use tax from their Wisconsin customers must also obtain a use tax registration certificate. Wis. Stat. §77.53(9m); Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.002(2)(b). Effective Oct. 1, 2018, Wisconsin requires certain remote sellers to begin collecting sales or use tax and to register to collect and remit Wisconsin's sales and use taxes. However, a remote seller that does not qualify for the small seller exception but only makes nontaxable sales in Wisconsin is not required to register for Wisconsin sales or use tax. For example, a remote seller that is a wholesaler and only sells products for resale, is not required to register for sales or use tax. Wisconsin Dept. of Rev., Remote Sellers Common Questions. Disaster Relief Out-of-state businesses that perform disaster relief work in Wisconsin during a disaster are not required to register for a seller's permit or a use tax registration certificate. Wis. Stat. §77.52(7)(b), as amended by 2015 Wis. A.B. 405, §13, effective Nov. 13, 2015; Wis. Stat. §77.53(9)(b), as amended by 2015 Wis. A.B. 405, §16, effective Nov. 13, 2015; see also 2017 Wis. A.B. 846, §41(clarifying that 2015 Wis. A.B. 405, §13 is not repealed by 2015 Wis. S.B. 440). In order to claim the exemption from registration requirements, the out-of-state business must provide notice to the Wisconsin Department of Revenue no later than 90 days after the last day of a disaster period, that the out-of-state business is in the state solely to perform disaster relief work. Wis. Stat. §323.12(5)(c), as enacted by 2015 Wis. A.B. 405, §19, effective Nov. 13, 2015. Consumer Use Tax Registration Certificates Consumers who regularly have use tax obligations because of purchases made without sales or use tax being charged by the seller, and that are not otherwise required to hold a seller's permit or use tax registration certificate, must obtain a consumer's use tax registration certificate. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.002(2)(c). Local Exposition Registration Every taxpayer selling lodging, food, beverages, candy, chewing gum, or lozenges, or renting automobiles subject to local exposition district taxes must register with the Department of Revenue. Wis. Stat. §77.982(4); Wis. Stat. §77.991(4); Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.002(2)(d); see also Wisconsin Dept. of Rev., Temporary Events Program–Common Questions (Dec. 8, 2015). Sales at Temporary Events In Wisconsin, sellers who sell taxable products or services at temporary events may be required to obtain a seller's permit from the Department of Revenue, and they also may be responsible for reporting and paying sales tax on sales made at the events. Wis. Stat. §73.03(38); Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.53; Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.535; Wisconsin Publication 228. Generally, any person conducting business as a retailer at a temporary event must hold a seller's permit. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.53(2). However, if the seller's taxable sales are less than $1,000 during the calendar year, then the seller need not hold a seller's permit. Instead, the sales are exempt occasional sales. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.53(3). For more information about the occasional sale exemption, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Wisconsin 7.4. Wisconsin defines the term “temporary event” as an activity at one place of operation for a brief duration where taxable sales are made. The regulations identify as examples fairs, carnivals, circuses, festivals, and portable roadside stands. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.53(1). Wisconsin agency guidance also provides additional examples, including:• flea markets; • trade shows, conventions, and consumer shows; • community or association picnics, fairs, markets, or festivals; • fundraising events; and • any other similar occurrences, occasions, activities, or functions. See Wisconsin Publication 228. Further, the agency guidance explains that a temporary event can occur on one day or consecutive days. Thus, if an organization holds an event every weekend, then each weekend constitutes a separate event. See Wisconsin Publication 228. Sales at “One-Time”Events If a seller is engaged in business in Wisconsin for a “one-time” event and does not intend to return to Wisconsin, then the seller is liable for Wisconsin sales or use tax on its Wisconsin sales through the end of the seller's tax year. Even if the seller does not sell at the event itself, but promotes future sales (e.g., gives potential customers business cards or other promotional materials), then the seller is still liable for Wisconsin sales or use tax on its Wisconsin sales through the end of the seller's tax year. Wisconsin Publication 228. If the seller has no further business activity in Wisconsin after that tax year, then the seller may surrender its seller's permit to the Department. In that case, the seller is not liable for Wisconsin sales or use tax on its sales made after the tax year in which it held a seller's permit. Wisconsin Publication 228. Multi-Level Marketing Companies and Their Distributors The Department regards each multi-level marketing company as a retailer required to remit Wisconsin sales tax on sales to its distributors. In the absence of data showing an exact selling price, then the retailer must assume that its distributors will sell to the ultimate consumers at the suggested retail price and collect sales tax accordingly. Wisconsin relieves individual distributors are relieved of the responsibilities to register with the Department and collect and remit the tax because the multi-level marketing company has done so. Wisconsin Publication 228. If the multi-level marketing company does not collect the tax from its distributor, then the distributor is liable for Wisconsin sales or use tax on its sales price of products sold and its purchase price of products that it uses or gives away, rather than resells, in Wisconsin. Wisconsin Publication 228. Antiques, Crafts, and Artwork A dealer selling antiques, crafts, or artwork at a mall, where the mall operator does not disclose the dealer's identity to the purchaser is not making retail sales and is therefore, not required to have a seller's permit. In this situation, the mall operator is the retailer and is required to have a seller's permit. However, if the mall operator discloses the dealer's identity to the purchaser, the dealer is making retail sales and is required to have a seller's permit. Wisconsin Publication 230. Distribution Facility Operators Effective July 14, 2015, operators of distribution facilities may make sales of tangible personal property on behalf of third-party sellers without becoming liable for tax on the sales if the following criteria apply:• the third-party seller that owns the tangible personal property sold is disclosed to the customer as the seller; and • neither the distribution facility operator nor any affiliate of the operator makes any sales for which the customer takes possession of the tangible personal property at a location of the operator or any of its affiliates. This exception does not apply to:• sales at auction; • sales of tangible personal property owned or previously owned by the distribution facility operator or any of its affiliates; or • sales of any of the following that are registered or titled, or required to be registered or titled, in Wisconsin or the U.S.: ○ motor vehicles; ○ aircraft; ○ snowmobiles; ○ recreational vehicles; ○ trailers; ○ semitrailers; ○ all-terrain vehicles; ○ utility terrain vehicles; or ○ boats. Wis. Stat. §77.51(13b), as amended by 2015 Wis. S.B. 21, effective July 14, 2015; Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.33(4)(a)(3), effective July 1, 2018; see Wisconsin Tax Bulletin No. 192 - Articles.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Tax Collection and Remittance

Seller Every retailer engaged in business in this state and making sales of tangible personal property, items, property, goods, or taxable services that are sourced to the state of Wisconsin must, at the time of making the sales collect the tax from the purchaser. Wis. Stat. §77.53(3); Wis. Stat. §77.53(5). BNA-SUTN WI 31.3.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Purchaser Liability

Allowed. Every person storing, using, or otherwise consuming in Wisconsin tangible personal property, or specified items, property, goods, or taxable services purchased from a retailer, is liable for the tax. Wis. Stat. §77.53(2). The purhcaser's liability is not extinguished until the tax has been paid to Wisconsin, but a receipt with the tax separately stated from a retailer engaged in business in Wisconsin (or from a retailer who is authorized by the department and who is regarded as a retailer engaged in business in Wisconsin for purposes of the tax) given to the purchaser relieves the purchaser from further liability for the tax to which the receipt refers. Wis. Stat. §77.53(2). BNA-SUTN WI 31.3.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Business Owners, Operators

Yes Any person who is required to collect, account for, or pay the amount of tax that is due to the Department of Revenue and who willfully fails to do so is personally liable for such amounts, including interest and penalties, if that person's principal is unable to pay such amounts to the Department. The personal liability of the responsible party survives the dissolution of the business entity. Wis. Stat. §77.60(9); Wisconsin Administrative Decision 10-S-276, Villager Food Mart v. Wisconsin Dept. of Rev. (April 4, 2012). For an officer to be held liable for unpaid sales tax, the Wisconsin Department of Revenue must demonstrate that:• the individual had authority to pay the sales and use tax liability; • he or she had the duty to pay the sales and use tax liability; and • there was an intentional breach of that duty. Wisconsin Administrative Decision 14-S-101 (Nov. 4, 2016); Wisconsin Tax Bulletin No. 196. Personal liability may be assessed by the Department against a responsible party for the making of sales tax determinations against retailers and is subject to the provisions for review of sales tax determinations against retailers. Wis. Stat. §77.60(9); Wisconsin Administrative Decision 10-S-276, Villager Food Mart v. Wisconsin Dept. of Rev. (April 4, 2012). “Person” includes an officer, employee, or other responsible person of a corporation or other form of business association. Additionally, the definition includes a member, employee, or other responsible person of a partnership, limited liability company, or sole proprietorship who, as an officer, employee, member, or other responsible person, is under a duty to collect, account for, or pay the amount of tax. Wis. Stat. §77.60(9); Wisconsin Tax Bulletin No. 119. A purchaser or assignee of the business or stock of goods, including furniture, fixtures, equipment and inventory, of any retailer liable for sales or use tax is personally liable for the payment of the sales or use tax if the purchaser or assignee fails to withhold a sufficient amount of the purchase price to cover the taxes due, until the retailer produces a receipt from the Department of Revenue stating that the retailer has paid the tax or a certificate stating that no amount is due. Wis. Stat. §77.52(18)(am); Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.91(1)(a). If the purchaser of a stock of goods fails to withhold from the purchase price, the purchaser becomes personally liable for the payment of the amount required to be withheld by the purchaser to the extent of the purchase price valued in money. Within 60 days of receiving a written request from the purchaser for a certificate, or within 60 days from the date the former owner's records are made available for audit, which ever period expires later, but not later than 90 days after receiving the request, the Department will issue the certificate. Alternatively, effective April 19, 2018, the Department may send notice to the purchaser of the amount that must be paid as a condition of issuing the certificate. Prior to April 19, 2018, the Department must issue a certificate or mail notice to the purchaser of the amount that must be paid as a condition of issuing the certificate. The obligation of the successor may be enforced within four years from the later of the time retailer sells out the retailer's business or stock of goods or the time that the determination against the retailer becomes final. Wis. Stat. §77.52(18)(bm). A financial institution or mortgagee who forecloses on a loan to a retailer owing delinquent sales or use tax will not incur successor liability. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.91(1)(d). If a creditor, including a financial institution, actually operates a business which has been voluntarily surrendered by a delinquent debtor in full or partial liquidation of a debt, the creditor is subject to successor liability. A creditor, however, is not subject to successor liability when it acquires possession of a business voluntarily surrendered, if it never operates the business and its sole purpose is to sell the business in its entirety, as a whole or piecemeal. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.91(1)(g). For example, a bank that took possession of and operated a men's clothing business that had been voluntarily surrendered by a delinquent debtor in full or partial liquidation of debt is subject to successor liability. Wisconsin Administrative Decision S-9711, Citizens Nat'l Bank of Stevens Point v. Wisconsin Dept. of Rev. (1983), citing Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.91(1)(g). BNA-SUTN WI 31.3.3.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Reliance on SST Matrix

Relieves Liability Sellers and certified service providers (CSPs) are relieved from tax liability to the member state and its local jurisdictions for having charged and collected the incorrect amount of sales and use tax resulting from the seller or CSP relying on erroneous data provided by the member state relative to treatment of the terms defined in sections A, B, and C of the SST Matrix or tax administration practices contained in Section D of the Matrix. Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Taxability Matrix, Wisconsin (version 2018.0); see also Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, User Guide: Online Taxability Matrix and Certificate of Compliance (Nov. 20, 2018). To the extent possible, under each state's laws, sellers and CSPs are also relieved from tax liability to the member state and its local jurisdictions for having charged and collected the incorrect amount of sales and use tax until the first day of the calendar month that is at least 30 days after notice of a change to Sections A-D of the state's taxability matrix is submitted to the governing board, provided the seller or CSP relied on the prior version of the taxability matrix.

Wis. Stat. § 77.524(3). The seller is subject to an audit on transactions that the certified service provider processed only if there is probable cause to believe that the seller has committed fraud or made a material misrepresentation. The seller is subject to an audit on transactions that the certified service provider does not process. Wis. Stat. § 77.524(3). A person that provides a certified automated system is responsible for the system's proper functioning and is liable to this state for tax underpayments that are attributable to errors in the system's functioning. A seller that uses a certified automated system is responsible and liable to this state for reporting and remitting sales and use tax. Wis. Stat. § 77.524(4). Additionally, a seller that has a proprietary system for determining the amount of tax that is due on transactions and that has signed an agreement with the states that are signatories to the agreement establishing a performance standard for the system is liable for the system's failure to meet the performance standard.

Required for Certain Taxpayers Wisconsin requires a person who owes general, county, and stadium sales and use tax to use the electronic funds transfer (EFT) payment method when the aggregate amount due in the prior calendar year was $300.00 or more. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 1.12(4)(a)(3). “Electronic funds transfer” or “EFT” means any transfer of funds initiated through a terminal, telephone, computer, or magnetic tape authorizing a financial institution to debit or credit an account for next day settlement. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 1.12(3)(d). The Department will notify a person when EFT payments or deposits are required. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 1.12(4)(c).

When the prescribed due date falls on a weekend, legal holiday, or day the Federal Reserve Bank is closed, the payment due date is revised to be the first business day immediately following the weekend, holiday, or day the Federal Reserve Bank was closed. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 1.12(8)(c). The Secretary of the Department of Revenue may waive the requirement to use the EFT payment method when the requirement causes an undue hardship. In order to qualify for the waiver, the taxpayer must do all of the following:• request the waiver in writing using Form EFT-102, Electronic Filing or Electronic Payment Waiver Request; • clearly indicate on the form why the requirement will cause undue hardship;and • otherwise be current on all return and report filings and tax payments. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 1.12(9)(a).

Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 1.12(9)(b). Examples of unusual circumstances include:• the person does not have access to a touch tone telephone; • the person is physically unable to use a touch tone telephone; and • the telephone system available to the person is incompatible with the Department's telephone system used for EFT registration or payments, both.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Vendor Collection Discounts

0.5% A portion of sales and use taxes collected on retail sales may be retained by qualified taxpayers. The amount is to be determined by the Department of Revenue and by contracts that the Department enters into jointly with other states as a member state of the streamlined sales tax governing board pursuant to the agreement. Wis. Stat. §77.63. The following individuals may retain a portion of the taxes collected:• a certified service provider; • a seller that uses a certified automated system; and • a seller that sells tangible personal property, items, property, or goods under Wis. Stat. §77.52(a),(b), (c), or (d), or taxable services in at least five states that are signatories to the streamlined sales tax agreement, with total annual sales revenue of at least $500 million, that has a proprietary system that calculates the amount of tax owed to each taxing jurisdiction in which the seller sells tangible personal property or taxable services, and that has entered into a performance agreement with the states that are signatories to the agreement. The term “seller”includes an affiliated group of sellers using the same proprietary system to calculate the amount of tax owed to each taxing jurisdiction. Wis. Stat. §77.63. A retailer's discount is 0.5 percent of the sales and use tax payable. “Sales and use tax payable” includes the amount of the 5 percent state sales and use tax payable on retail sales, the amount of the 0.5 percent county sales and use tax payable retail sales, and the amount of the 0.1 percent or 0.5 percent stadium sales and use tax payable on retail sales. The discount, however, is not allowed on any taxes paid after the due or extended due date of the sales and use tax return. The retailer's discount is limited to $1,000 per reporting period.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Certificates Required

Yes In Wisconsin it is presumed that all receipts are subject to the tax until the contrary is established. The seller of taxable goods or services may rebut the presumption of taxability by taking from the purchaser a paper or electronic exemption certificate in a manner prescribed by the Department of Revenue. Wis. Stat. §77.52(14)(a). The exemption certificate need not be designated by the Department of Revenue. However, its contents must satisfy and conform with the Department's rules. For example, the certificate must provide information that identifies the purchaser and must indicate the basis for the claimed exemption. Additionally, a paper certificate, among other things, must be signed by the purchaser. Wis. Stat. §77.52(14)(a); Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.14(2)(b). Exemption certificates signed by purchasers or lessees are given to sellers or lessors to verify that a transaction is exempt. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.14(2)(a). A purchaser who presents and exemption certificate indicating that goods or service are tax-exempt under certain circumstances or for resale is liable for sales and use tax if the purchaser subsequently uses the good or services in a manner that makes the good or service taxable. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.14(2)(c). State Specific Exemption Certificates • Form S-211 is a multipurpose form which may be used for any sales and use tax exemption provided by law; Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.14(2)(a)(1). and • Form S-207CT-1 is a certificate which may be used by a contractor to purchase building materials without a county or stadium tax for a construction contract entered into before the effective date of the county or stadium tax. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.14(2)(a)(2). Retention Period The state does not specify the duration of time that a seller should retain exemption certificates, but the statute of limitations on assessing sales tax in Wisconsin is four years after the date the return is filed. Therefore, a taxpayer should maintain such records for a minimum of four years from such filings. Wis. Stat. §77.59(3). Consequences of Failing to Obtain Exemption Certificates A vendor is liable for tax on a claimed exempt transaction unless the vendor is in possession of a properly accepted exemption certificate. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.14(4). Exemption Certificate Substitutions, Data Elements A person may use a substitute exemption certificate if it contains all of the essential information relating to the transaction and if it is a form approved by the Department of Revenue. The certificate must be signed by and bear the name and address of the purchaser, and it must indicate the general character of the property or service being purchased and the basis of the claimed exemption. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.14(2)(b). Exemption certificates are not required for occasional sales that are statutorily exempt under Wis. Stat. §77.54(7) and Wis. Stat. §77.54(7m); Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.14(16). Exemption Certificates Not Required It should be noted that there are various sales that are statutorily exempt from sales and use tax that do not require an exemption certificate. Wis. Admin.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Validity Periods

Depends Continuous exemption certificates do not expire and need not be renewed at any prescribed interval. However, they should be renewed at reasonable intervals in case of a business change, registration number change, or discontinuance of the specific business claiming the exemption. The seller should periodically review exemption certificates on file to ascertain that the person claiming the exemption is the person who furnished the certificate. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.14(5)(a). A continuous exemption certificate approved by the Department does not allow a purchaser to issue “this time only” purchase orders cancelling the continuous tax exemption certificate for the one transaction only. The seller is not liable for the tax on transactions covered by a valid exemption certificate, unless the purchase order is accompanied by a separate letter explaining the inapplicability of the previously issued certificate claiming resale. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.14(5)(b). An exemption certificate covering gasoline or diesel fuel are valid for three years unless cancelled by the Wisconsin Department of Revenue or by the person claiming the exemption. 2014 Wis.

Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.13(6)(b)(3). The direct pay permit holder must report Wisconsin use tax on the sales price of tangible personal property or taxable services purchased from a retailer without tax using a direct pay permit if the property or service is subject to sales or use tax. The tax is reported on the direct pay permit holder's Wisconsin sales tax return for the period in which the taxable storage, use, or consumption first occurs in Wisconsin. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.13(2)(b). A taxpayer who holds a valid business tax registration certificate may apply for a direct pay permit by filing a completed form S-101, “Application for Direct Pay Permit” with the Department of Revenue. The Department will issue a permit, at the beginning of a taxpayer's taxable year, if the following requirements are fulfilled:• Because of the nature of the applicant's business, issuing the permit will significantly reduce the work of administering the sales taxes; • The taxpayer's accounting system will clearly indicate the amount of sales tax that the applicant owes; • The applicant makes enough purchases that are taxable to justify the expense of regular audits by the Department; • The applicant is not liable for delinquent taxes; including costs, penalties, surcharges, and interest, under the income and franchise tax; estate tax; taxation of public utilities and insurers; motor vehicle and general aviation fuel tax; beverages, controlled substance and tobacco tax; or sales tax of $400 or more if any part of the tax is delinquent for at least five months; • It is in the state's best interests to issue the permit; • The applicant purchases enough tangible personal property or items under Wis. Stat. §77.52(1)(b), (c), or (d) under circumstances that make it difficult to determine whether the property, items, or goods will be subject to sales tax; and • The applicant holds a permit under Wis. Stat. §77.52(9) or is registered under Wis. Stat. §77.53(9). Wis. Stat. §77.52(17m)(b). A direct pay permit for sales tax is effective for purchases made beginning on the first day of the applicant's franchise and income tax year, after the permit is issued. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.13(3)(c). When purchasing items without paying tax, a direct pay permit holder shall provide one of the following to the retailer:• A copy of its direct pay permit. The direct pay permit holder shall also provide to the retailer a written statement as to whether the direct pay permit is for a single purchase or is continuous; or • Form S-211, “Wisconsin Sales and Use Tax Exemption Certificate”or other written or electronic documentation. The document must contain all of the following: ○ The name and address of the direct pay permit holder; ○ A statement that the direct pay permit holder is purchasing without Wisconsin sales or use tax using a direct pay permit; ○ The direct pay permit holder's direct pay permit number; ○ The effective date of the direct pay permit; ○ A statement as to whether the use of the direct pay permit is for a single purchase or is continuous; and ○ The signature of the direct pay permit holder. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.13(5)(a). If a direct pay permit holder indicates in writing to a retailer that the use of the direct pay permit is continuous, that purchase and all subsequent purchases from the retailer shall be made without paying Wisconsin sales or use tax to the retailer. It is necessary for the holder of a continuous direct pay permit to provide documentation to a retailer at the time the direct pay permit holder begins making purchases without paying tax to that retailer, rather at the time of each purchase. While the use of a direct pay permit is continuous, all purchases from a retailer, except those not eligible for direct pay, are to be made using the direct pay permit even though an exemption certificate requiring different documentation may apply. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.13(5)(b)(3). A taxpayer who holds a direct pay permit must keep a record of all retailers from whom the person made a purchase using the permit and:• fulfill the requirements for an exempt sale for every purchase that the person makes that may be exempt and pay the use tax to the Department on all of those purchases for which the tax is due; or • maintain accounting records that the tax was paid on each purchase during each reporting period and the total tax paid during each reporting period, pay the sales tax on either all or none of the purchases made from each retailer during each reporting period, and pay the use tax to the Department on all of the purchases for which the tax is due. Wis. Stat. §77.52(17m)(f). The Department may revoke a direct pay permit at any time for misuse or if the Department determines the revocation is in the state's best interest. Wis. Stat. §77.52(17m)(d). A permit may be cancelled by the holder by mailing the permit to the Department for cancellation. A letter should accompany the permit stating the holder's intention to cancel the permit. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.13(4)(b). The cancellation of a permit becomes effective immediately following the last day of the holder's taxable year in which the permit was received by the Department. Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.13(4)(c).

Topic: Administration and Procedure Refunds

Both The Department may, by office or field audit, determine the tax required to be paid to the state or the refund due to any person. Wis. Stat. §77.59(1); Wis. Stat. §77.59(2). The determination may be made upon the basis of the facts contained in the return being audited or upon the basis of any other information within the Department's possession The determination is presumed correct and the burden of proving that the determination is incorrect is on the person challenging the issue. Wis. Stat. §77.59(1); Wis. Stat. §77.59(2). If the amount of the claim is at least $50, or if either the seller has ceased doing business, the buyer is field audited, or the seller may no longer file a claim, then the buyer may file a claim for a refund of taxes paid to the seller. In the event that both a buyer and a seller file a valid claim for the same refund, the Department of Revenue may pay either claim. Wis. Stat. §77.59(4)(a). A buyer who overpaid sales tax to a seller may request a refund of the overpaid tax from the seller. If the tax is greater than $50, the buyer may file a claim for refund directly from the Department of Revenue. Wisconsin Tax Bulletin No. 196. A claim for refund that is not to be passed along to customers may be made within two years of the determination of a tax assessed by office audit or field audit and paid if the tax was not protested by the filing of a petition for redetermination. No claim is allowed under Wis. Stat. §77.59(4)(b) for any tax self-assessed by the taxpayer. If a claim is filed under Wis. Stat. §77.59(4)(b), the Department of Revenue may make an additional assessment in respect to any item that was a subject of the prior assessment. Wis. Stat. §77.59(4)(b); see Wisconsin Administrative Decision 10-S-146 (Feb. 28, 2014). A claim for a refund is regarded as a request for determination. The determination is made within one year after the claim for refund is received by the Department, unless the taxpayer has consented in writing to an extension prior to the one-year time period expiration. The Department of Revenue may offset the amount of any refund for a period, together with interest on the refund, against deficiencies for another period, and against penalties and interest on the deficiencies, or against any amount of whatever kind, due and owing on the books of the Department from the person who is entitled to the refund. If the refund is to be paid to a buyer, the Department may also set off amounts in the same manner in which it sets off income tax and franchise tax refunds and may set off amounts for child support or maintenance or both in the manner in which it sets off income taxes. Wis. Stat. §77.59(5). The Department of Revenue may refund excess taxes paid to it, even if the person applying for the refund has been field audited in respect to those taxes, if the applicant's customers have filed valid claims for refunds with the applicant and if the refund is passed along to those customers. Wis. Stat. §77.59(8m). A seller who receives refunds under Wis. Stat. §77.59(4)(a) or (b) of taxes that the seller erroneously collected from buyers, but who does not remit such amounts to the state must submit the taxes and interest to the buyers from whom the taxes were collected, or to the Department if the seller cannot locate the buyers within 90 days after the date of refund, date of offset, or date the seller discovers the taxes were erroneously collected. If the seller receives a refund of taxes erroneously collected from customers, but does not return the refunded taxes to the customers, the seller must remit the refunded amount back to the Department, along with a 25 percent penalty. Wis. Stat. §77.59(5m); see Wisconsin Administrative Decision 11-S-257 (Nov. 17, 2015) (taxpayer received a refund for sales taxes collected erroneously, but never returned the refunded amounts to the customers from whom they were collected;taxpayer had to remit the refunded money back to the Department along with the mandatory 25 percent penalty). Effective April 19, 2018, a seller that continues to collect tax erroneously on a product after receiving 2 or more written notices from the Wisconsin Department of Revenue indicating that the product is not taxable is entitled to an adjustment or refund of the tax collected only if the seller returns the tax and related interest to the buyers from whom the seller collected the tax. The seller must submit the tax and related interest to the buyers, or to the department if the seller can not locate the buyers, no later than 90 days after the date of the adjustment or refund. If the seller does not submit the tax and related interest to the buyers or to the department by the end of the 90-day period, the seller must remit the refunded amount back to the Department, along with a 25 percent penalty. Wis. Stat. §77.59(5r), as added by 2017 Wis. A.B. 735, effective April 19, 2018. A determination as to a refund is final, unless within 60 days after receipt of the notice of determination, the taxpayer, or other person directly interested, petitions the Department for a redetermination. If the notice was served by publication, the 60-day period begins with the last day of publication of the notice. Wis. Stat. §77.59(6); Wisconsin Publication 505. The Department will notify the taxpayer of its redetermination within six months of the Department's receipt of the petition for redetermination. The redetermination becomes final 60 days after receipt by the petitioner of notice of the redetermination, unless the petitioner appeals within that 60-day period. Wis.

Yes The Wisconsin Department of Revenue has a voluntary disclosure program to encourage individuals and businesses who are not in compliance with Wisconsin tax laws to voluntarily come forward. Wisconsin Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program; Wisconsin Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure FAQs; see Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 1.15(5). Taxpayers may remain anonymous through the entire voluntary disclosure process. To qualify for the program, a taxpayer must meet the following conditions:• no tax returns were filed for the period in question; • no registration for the type of tax involved during the period in question;and • no contact by the Wisconsin Department of Revenue within the last six years regarding a registration/filing requirement or an assessment/audit assignment. Wisconsin Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program; Wisconsin Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure FAQs; see Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 1.15(5). The Department of Revenue considers the receipt of a nexus questionnaire to be the commencement of an office audit, disqualifying the taxpayer for voluntary disclosure. Wisconsin Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program; Wisconsin Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure FAQs. To apply for voluntary disclosure, a taxpayer or a taxpayer's representative must submit a written request to the Department of Revenue. The request must include the following information:• a description of Wisconsin activities for the years involved; • a list of property owned or leased in Wisconsin; • taxpayer's taxable year-end; • date the taxable activities began in Wisconsin; • whether the tax involved has been collected or withheld and for what periods; • whether the tax has been paid to a vendor in error for which a credit is being claimed; • approximate liability for each of the years involved; • prior contact by the Department of Revenue; • other types of tax returns currently being filed with the Department of Revenue; and • whether the taxpayer is registered with the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions to transact business in Wisconsin. Wisconsin Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program; Wisconsin Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure FAQs. The taxpayer must file all returns for the periods agreed upon within ninety days; pay all tax, late filing fees, and interest according to the agreement; file the current and any subsequent returns in a timely manner according to the agreement; and make books and records available to the Department. Wisconsin Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program; Wisconsin Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure FAQs. All voluntary disclosure agreements include provisions reserving the Department's right to:• audit factual representations made as part of the agreement; • audit the taxpayer and any returns filed; • void the agreement if factual misrepresentations have been made by the taxpayer and assess additional tax, penalties, and interest as appropriate;and • void the agreement if the taxpayer fails to comply with any terms of the agreement.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Audits

Authorized The Department of Revenue is authorized to perform office audits to determine the tax required to be paid or the refund due to any person. Wis. Stat. §77.59(1). The determination may be made on the basis of the facts contained in the return being audited or on the basis of any other information that the Department has in its possession. The determination is presumed to be correct and the burden of proving it to be incorrect is on the person challenging the correctness. One or more office audit determinations may be made of the amount due for any one or for more than one period. Wis. Stat. §77.59(1). The following are the usual steps the Department follows in conducting an office audit and in making an assessment or refund adjustment.• the Department examines tax returns or credit claims to check the correctness of the items reported; • the Department may request more information or receipts to clarify or support some items; • the Department may then decide that an adjustment to the returns is necessary, with the result that the taxpayer owes an additional amount or receives a refund; • the Department then sends a notice of amount due to the taxpayer explaining the amount due or a notice of refund explaining the refund to be issued. The notice shows the amount of tax, interest, penalty (if any) and explains the taxpayer's appeal rights. Wisconsin Publication 505. Field Audits The Department of Revenue is also authorized to perform field audits to determine the tax required to be paid or the refund to any person. The determination may be made on the basis of the facts contained in the return being audited or on the basis of any other information that the Department of Revenue has in its possession. The determination may be made on the basis of sampling, regardless of whether the person being audited has complete records of transactions and regardless of whether the person being audited consents. The Department may examine and inspect the books, records, memoranda and property of any person to verify the tax liability of that person or of another person. The Department may subpoena any person to give testimony under oath before it and to produce any books, records, or memoranda that are necessary to enable the Department to verify the tax liability of that person or of another person. The determination is presumed to be correct and the burden of proving it to be incorrect is on the person challenging the correctness. Wis. Stat. §77.59(2); Wis. Admin. Code Tax § 11.905; see Wisconsin Publication 501 (providing general information regarding field audits); Wisconsin Publication 515 (explaining non-statistical sampling and why/when it is used by the Wisconsin Department of Revenue in field audits); Wisconsin Publication 516 (explaining statistical sampling and why/when it is used by the Wisconsin Department of Revenue in field audits). Businesses with annual sales of less than $10,000,000 can require the Wisconsin Department of Revenue to use a statistical sampling method during an audit if they meet all of the following criteria:• all of the taxpayer's accounting transactions are maintained in an electronic format and are capable of secure electronic transfer to the department, in a form useable by the department; • the taxpayer's data processing accounting system is capable of producing and transferring to the department an electronic spreadsheet of all accounts for each period under audit, including account number, account description, and year-end and pre-closing balances; • all of the taxpayer's electronic sales and purchase transactions include the customer or vendor name, the electronic transaction number that identifies and leads to the source document, the electronic transaction date, the electronic transaction date, and information necessary to determine where the transaction should be sourced; • the documentation used to prepare each sales and use tax return filed with the department to report sales and use tax paid is available for review by the department, including transaction detail, reports, and work papers; • all sample unit source documents are available for review by the department; and • there are at least 10,000 sample units in the sample population.
