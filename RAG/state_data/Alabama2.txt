Topic: Administration and Procedure Agencies Responsible for Administration Local Sales and Use Tax

Local County Commission or Alabama DOR The county commission of any county of Alabama may, by ordinance or resolution, administer and collect or contract for the collection of any local sales and use taxes or other local county taxes. Ala. Code §11-3-11.2(a). If a county elects to do so, it has the same rights, remedies, power and authority that would be available to the Alabama Department of Revenue as if the tax or taxes were being administered, enforced, and collected by the Alabama Department of Revenue. Ala. Code §11-3-11.2(b). This includes the same statute of limitations, filing requirements, and similar provisions. Ala. Code §11-3-11.2(a); Ala. Code §11-3-11.3(a); see also Westover, Ala. v. Bynum, 2012 BL 224372, 103 So. 3d 827 (Ala. Civ. App. 2012) (town's sales tax collection not barred by doctrine of laches when four years passed before it sought to collect from or notify taxpayer of obligation). However, counties and municipalities may pass an ordinance or resolution requesting that the Alabama Department of Revenue collect and administer any county sales, use, rental, lodgings, tobacco, or other local taxes for which there is a corresponding state levy, provided that the tax parallels, except for rate, the state sales and use tax, including all definitions, exceptions, exemptions, requirements, enforcement and collection of taxes. Ala. Code §11-3-11.3, as amended by 2017 Ala. S.B. 316, effective Aug. 1, 2017, Ala. Code §11-51-208, and Ala. Code §40-12-4, as amended by, 2017 Ala. S.B. 111, effective March 1, 2019; Ala. Code §11-51-207; Ala. Code §11-51-180(a); Ala. Code §40-12-5; see Alabama Dept. of Rev., Notice and Resolution of County of Marshall (Oct. 22, 2018); Alabama Dept. of Rev., Notice and Resolution of Town of Gordo (June 20, 2017) (Town of Gordo adopts resolution electing to use the Alabama Department of Revenue to administer and collect its local sales and use tax, effective July 1, 2017)); Alabama Dept. of Rev., Notice and Resolution of City of Hartselle (June 19, 2017) (City of Hartselle adopts resolution electing to use the Alabama Department of Revenue to administer and collect its local sales and use and any other additional taxes, effective July 1, 2017). If the county fails to notify the department of an incorrect rate published by the department, a taxpayer is not liable for having charged and collected an insufficient amount. Ala. Code §11-51-210, as amended by, 2017 Ala. S.B. 111, effective March 1, 2019. Regardless of whether the tax is administered by the state or the municipality, local sales and use tax returns are required to be filed electronically and paid by the 20th day of each month for the previous month's taxes. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-1-6-.12;Alabama Dept. of Rev., Frequently Asked Questions. When paying local sales, use, and rental taxes through the use of the Automated Clearing House (ACH) credit method, taxpayers are required to make the payment to the correct payee through their financial institution. For state-administered local taxes, the payment is made to the Alabama Department of Revenue. For local taxes administered by a county or municipality, ACH credit payment method taxpayers should contact the locality or its tax administrator to obtain the banking information of where to send the payment to match the electronic return received by that locality. Late penalties and interest may occur if payments are misdirected or insufficient information is provided to timely identify the payment. Alabama Dept. of Rev., ACH Credit Method Payments & ONE SPOT (Jan. 17, 2014). An Alabama town administering its sales tax and business-license fees that had waited four years before attempting to collect or notify a taxpayer that it should have been collecting sales tax, was not barred by the doctrine of laches from enforcing its ordinances to collect the taxes and fees. The trial court's reliance on equity principles despite a recognition of the taxpayer having notice of the ordinance by virtue of it having been passed, was rejected due to disfavor of the application of the doctrine of laches against a governmental entity engaged in a governmental function. Huntsville, Ala. v. Stove House 5, Inc., 3 So.3d 186, (Ala. May 30, 2008) BNA-SUTN AL 31.1.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Vendor/Seller Registration

Required Any individual or business that engages in activities covered by the privilege or license tax (the Alabama equivalent of state sales or use tax)must apply for and obtain a license from the Department of Revenue to engage in and to conduct such business. Ala. Code §40-23-2; Ala. Code §40-23-6. Bonding Requirement Any person applying for an initial license or the renewal of an expired or cancelled license on or after January 1, 2020, must purchase and maintain a one-time surety bond for a two-year period, executed by the applicant as principal and by a corporate surety company qualified to do business in the state as surety, in the amount of $25,000. The bond must be payable to the commissioner and to his or her successors in office. Ala. Code §40-23-6(b)(1), as amended by 2018 Ala. H.B. 151, effective April 4, 2018. The Department of Revenue will waive the surety bond requirement where: (1) the person applying for an initial license or the renewal of an expired or cancelled license and a current licensee are related parties as defined in Ala. Code §40-23-190(b), are members of a controlled group of corporations as defined in I.R.C. §1563, or with respect to any other business, whether or not incorporated, would be members of a controlled group if similar rules applied to the business; and(2) the current licensee has been compliant over the previous two-year period. Ala. Code §40-23-6(b)(2), as amended by 2018 Ala. H.B. 151, effective April 4, 2018.

Ala. Code §40-23-6(c)(1), as amended by 2018 Ala. H.B. 151, effective April 4, 2018. After two years of continuous compliance, a licensee will be exempt from the surety bond requirement so long as the licensee collects and timely remits sales tax. Ala. Code §40-23-6(d), as amended by 2018 Ala. H.B. 151, effective April 4, 2018. Out-of-State Vendors Registration Vendors located outside Alabama must apply for and obtain a license from the Department of Revenue to engage in certain sales activities in Alabama if any of the following requirements are met:• the vendor maintains a place of business in the state; • the vendor qualifies to do business in the state; • the vendor solicits and receives purchases or orders by agent or salesman;or • the vendor distributes catalogs or other advertising material, and later receives and accepts orders from residents. Ala. Code §40-23-66. Out-of-State Sellers Making Significant Sales into Alabama Effective Jan. 1, 2016, out-of-state sellers that lack a physical presence in Alabama but are making retail sales of tangible personal property into the state have a substantial economic presence and must register for a license with the Department of Revenue and collect and remit use tax according to Ala. Code §40-23-67 when the seller's retail sales in Alabama exceed $250,000 per year based on the previous year's sales and the seller conducts an activity described in Ala. Code §40-23-68. This requirement may be satisfied by collecting, reporting and remitting taxes according to the provisions of Alabama's use tax law, or by participating in the Simplified Sellers Use Tax Remittance Program. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-2-.90.03(2); Ala. Code §§40-23-190 to 40-23-199 (The Simplified Sellers Use Tax Remittance Act). For more information on the Simplified Sellers Use Tax Remittance Program, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Alabama 3.1.2.7. Peddlers, Truckers, and Itinerant Vendors Alabama requires peddlers and/or truckers to apply for and obtain a sales tax license if they make retail sales through an established place of business or have a well-established and continuous business confined to a certain area or route. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.118(1). If peddlers or truckers don't have a well-established place of business or route, they may be required to furnish a bond payment as a condition of doing business in the state. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.118(2). The bond amount will be determined by the Department of Revenue, representing the estimated sales tax due in the upcoming year in an amount that is less than $1000 but is more than $100. Ala. Code §40-23-24. Other itinerant vendors similarly will be required to post this bond as a condition of doing business in Alabama. Ala. Code §40-23-24. Revocation of Vendor License If the Alabama Department of Revenue denies or revokes a vendor's license, the Department of Revenue will notify the vendor in writing by first-class mail to the vendor's last known address. A taxpayer may appeal the revocation or denial of a license if they file an appeal within 30 days with the Alabama Tax Tribunal. Ala. Code §40-2A-8; Ala. Admin. Code r. 887-x-1-.3; Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-14-1-.22. Currently, the Department does not have the authority to close sales tax accounts on the basis of inactivity. Alabama Administrative Law Judge Ruling Docket No. S 19-319-JP (April 29, 2019). Local Business Delivery Licenses Alabama municipalities must allow businesses without a physical presence in the municipality to purchase a license to deliver merchandise within the municipality. The purchase of such a license, in and of itself, does not establish nexus between the business and the municipality for purposes of sales and use tax. Ala. Code §11-51-194, as amended by 2019 Ala. H.B. 329 effective May 28, 2019. BNA-SUTN AL 31.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Tax Collection and Remittance

Seller Alabama requires the seller or vendor to collect sales tax from all applicable purchasers, and to remit the tax to the Department of Revenue. Ala. Code §40-23-26; Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-4-.20. If the seller fails to collect the appropriate sales tax due, then the seller is personally liable to pay the tax. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.184(1). However, where a seller acts in good faith and reasonably believes a purchase is legally tax-exempt based on the purchaser having provided a State Sales and Use Tax Certificate of Exemption (Form STE-1), the seller will not be liable for the uncollected sales tax. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.184(2). Consumer Liability Retail purchasers are considered to be the party on whom sales tax ultimately is imposed. As a result, retail purchasers/consumers must pay use tax on all applicable items purchased in the state unless the consumer can produce a receipt showing that sales tax was paid to the retailer. Ala. Code §40-23-26. BNA-SUTN AL 31.3.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Purchaser Liability

Yes All purchasers storing, using or otherwise consuming in Alabama tangible personal property purchased at retail are liable for use tax for which the liability will not be extinguished until the tax has been paid to the state. Ala. Code §40-23-61(d). However, a receipt from a retailer maintaining a place of business in Alabama or a retailer authorized by the department to collect sales and use tax, given to the purchaser is sufficient to relieve the purchaser from further liability for tax to which such receipt may refer. Ala. Code §40-23-61(d). BNA-SUTN AL 31.3.2.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Business Owners, Operators

Yes Alabama levies a 100 percent penalty against any person responsible for paying a corporation's trust fund taxes that willfully fails to do so. Ala. Code §40-29-72; Ala. Code §40-29-73. Although a taxpayer's name appears on the Alabama state sales tax license, the taxpayer may be relieved of liability for unpaid sales taxes if the taxpayer can provide sufficient evidence that someone else actually owned and operated the retail location. See Alabama Administrative Law Judge Ruling Docket No. S. 08-584 (May 12, 2009). A company subleasing a building to a bingo machine operator was not responsible for the payment of tax on the receipts from those machines where the company was not involved in operating the facility, other than by subleasing and performing certain repairs on the building. Alabama Administrative Law Judge Ruling Docket No. S. 10-591 (March 19, 2013). A single member LLC is automatically disregarded, and the member is assessed for sales tax owed, if the LLC does not “check the box” by electing to be taxed as a corporation for federal purposes. Ala. Code §10-12-8(b); Alabama Administrative Law Judge Ruling Docket No. S. 16-989-CE (Jan. 14, 2019). BNA-SUTN AL 31.3.3.

If an entity does not have a valid certificate of exemption, it will no longer be allowed to make tax-exempt purchases or rent tax-exempt accommodations. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-5-.02(3), added effective Feb. 10, 2016; see also 2015 Ala. S.B. 24;Alabama Dept. of Rev., Exempt Entities Required to Obtain Exemption Certificate. As of June 4, 2016, all non-governmental entities are required to file an annual informational report with the Department to renew a certificate of exemption. Penalties may be imposed for non-compliance with reporting requirements. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-5-.02.02(6), effective June 4, 2016. Blanket Certificates An exempt purchaser who holds an exemption certificate and who regularly makes tax-exempt purchases of the kind and nature for which the exemption certificate has been made may provide a seller with a blanket exemption certificate. A blanket certificate specifies that all tangible personal property subsequently purchased will be for the purpose shown on the certificate, such as a purchase for resale. This relieves the purchaser of providing a separate exemption certificate for each qualifying tax-exempt purchase, as long as there is no change in the character of their operations. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-5-.02(7), renumbered effective Feb. 10, 2016. Contractors, Subcontractors, and Governmental Entities Performing Government Entity Projects All contractors and subcontractors working on qualifying governmental entity projects are entitled to receive from the Department of Revenue a Form STC-1, Sales and Use Tax Certificate of Exemption for Government Entity Projects. Each contractor and subcontractor who obtains a certificate of exemption for a government entity project is required to file monthly consumers use tax returns. Contractors should report their exempt purchases made for each project on the return. Ala. Code §40-9-14; Alabama Notice: Tax Guidance for Contractors, Subcontractors and Alabama Governmental Entities Regarding Construction-related Contracts. Drive-Out Certificates Alabama provides an exemption for motor vehicles purchased for use out-of-state. However, taxpayers must provide properly executed drive-our certificates in order to be relived of remitting sales and use tax on motor vehicles sold to out-of-state buyers. The Department of Revenue will charge a motor vehicle seller the sales and use tax that was due at the point of sale for all automobiles that were sold without a properly executed drive-out certificate. Alabama Administrative Law Judge Ruling Docket No. S. 16-557 (Dec. 28, 2016); see also Ala. Code §40-23-2(4); Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-3-.42.03. BNA-SUTN AL 31.8.1.

No Specific Time Period Alabama statutes and regulations do not specify any time period requirements for record-keeping. Ala. Code §40-23-9. However, Alabama requires individuals and businesses making taxable sales to keep and preserve suitable records of the gross sales, gross proceeds of sales, and gross receipts of sales. This includes maintaining accurate and complete records, books or other information sufficient to allow the Department of Revenue to determine the correct amount of tax. Ala. Code §40-23-9; Ala. Code §40-2A-7(a)(1). Moreover, the Department generally has a 3 year time limitation from the due date or the filing of a return for entering a preliminary assessment (i.e., conducting an audit).

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Direct Pay Permits

Authorized If the nature of a taxpayer's business makes it very difficult at the time of purchase to determine the applicability of sales or use tax on purchases of tangible personal property, the Department of Revenue may issue a permit allowing the purchaser to make purchases without paying sales tax to the vendor. Ala. Code §40-23-31. Instead, the purchaser must remit the applicable sales tax directly to the Department of Revenue. Ala. Code §40-23-31. The following businesses may qualify for a direct pay permit:• electric cooperative or similar business; • telephone company or similar business; • mining or quarrying business; • compounding or processing tangible personal property business; and • vendors associated with these companies. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-4-.13; Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-4-.14. To qualify for a direct pay permit, the following requirements must be met:• permit holders must purchase all tangible personal property without payment of state-administered city and county use taxes to the seller and must report and pay all state-administered city and county use taxes directly to the Department; • permit holders must report state-administered city and county use taxes on forms approved by the Department and must pay the taxes directly to the Department on or before the 20th day of the month following the tax reporting period during which the tangible personal property was used for a taxable purpose; • permit holders must keep the books and records necessary to determine the use tax liability, and must make these books available for examination by the Department of Revenue; • the permit must not extend to construction contracts; and • the permit must not be transferable and may be canceled by the Department of Revenue. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-4-.13 through Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-4-.14. In addition, direct pay permits for electric cooperatives, telephone companies, or other similar businesses (or their associated vendors) must relate only to state-administered city and county use taxes. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-4-.13(2). Direct pay permits for businesses engaged in mining, quarrying, compounding, or processing tangible personal property (or their associated vendors) must also be accompanied by a bond or indemnity agreement securing the payment of the taxes to the Department in an amount not exceeding estimated sales tax liability for three months and estimated use tax liability for six months. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-4-.14(1)(d). Direct pay permit holders should make purchases using the permit, then self-report and pay tax to the Department of Revenue at a later date when the tax treatment of the purchases is determined. However, in certain cases a direct pay permit does not need to be used for all purchases because of the unreasonable and undue burden this requirement imposes on taxpayers. If permit holders maintain full and accurate records to demonstrate that sales tax was paid on purchases made without using the direct pay permit, and the records show sales tax was self-reported and paid on purchases made with the permit, then the Department of Revenue can review the records during an audit to determine whether the correct total tax for all purchases was remitted. Thus, direct pay permit holders may pay sales and use taxes to vendors on clearly taxable purchases that do not hinder or interfere with tax collection. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-4-.14; Alabama Administrative Law Judge Ruling Docket No. S. 15-1338 (Feb. 2, 2016) (invalidating the part of Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-4-.14 that requires taxpayers to use a direct pay permit for all purchases. The taxpayer's employees made some purchases through other means when it was impracticable to make them using the direct pay permit and when the transaction was clearly subject to sales tax. If the requirement that all purchases be made with the permit were upheld, an undue burden would be placed on taxpayers.) BNA-SUTN AL 31.8.10.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Record-Keeping Requirements

No Specific Time Period Alabama statutes and regulations do not specify any time period requirements for record-keeping. See Ala. Code §40-23-9. However, Alabama requires individuals and businesses making taxable sales to keep and preserve suitable records of the gross sales, gross proceeds of sales, and gross receipts of sales. This includes any books or other accounts that may be necessary to determine the amount of tax due. Ala. Code §40-23-9. If an individual or business fails to provide complete and accurate records, correct tax liability may be computed by the Department of Revenue using any reasonable method and the most accurate and complete information obtainable. Ala. Code §40-2A-7(b)(1); Alabama Administrative Law Judge Ruling Docket No. S. 16-1315-CE (May 15, 2018)(using a purchase mark-up audit where the taxpayer failed to keep records of sales made); Alabama Administrative Law Judge Ruling Docket No. S. 16-989-CE (Jan. 14, 2018)(because the taxpayer failed to maintain adequate records from which its sales could be accurately computed or verified, the examiner conducted a purchase mark-up audit to compute the taxpayer's liability for the audit period); Alabama Administrative Law Judge Ruling Docket No. S. 13-1067 (Jan. 16, 2014) (because a taxpayer failed to keep accurate records, the Department of Revenue examiner properly conducted a purchase mark-up audit to compute the taxpayer's tax liability). Individuals or businesses that make both taxable retail sales in addition to nontaxable sales must maintain their books and records in a manner that shows the separate gross proceeds from either taxable or nontaxable sales. Ala. Code §40-23-9. If the books do not adequately reflect the distinction between taxable and nontaxable sales, then all sales will be subject to sale tax. Ala. Code §40-23-9. BNA-SUTN AL 31.9.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Refunds

Both Taxpayers who have paid sales or use tax, and who believe an overpayment has occurred, may file a petition for a refund with the Department of Revenue. Ala. Code §40-2A-7(c). Alabama has two types of refund petitions that taxpayers may file. A seller may file Alabama Form ST-5: Direct Petition for Refund if the seller remitted in excess of the tax due but never collected the tax from the consumer/purchaser, or if the seller has previously refunded, credited, or repaid the tax directly to the consumer/purchaser. A consumer/purchaser may file Alabama Form ST-6, Refund of Taxes Paid to Seller if tax was paid directly to the seller. Ala. Code §40-2A-7(c). However, if the Department of Revenue has issued a final assessment, then the taxpayer may only submit a petition for refund if all taxes plus interest have been paid, or are paid at the time the refund petition is submitted. Ala. Code §40-2A-7(c). Effective Feb. 25, 2019, a refund petition that is equal to $25 or more and satisfies all other requirements will be processed upon submission. Refund petitions of less than $25 must be requested by the taxpayer or consumer/purchaser on an annual basis by either a single petition for refund or multiple combined petitions for refunds. Refund requests by individuals that are required to be filed annually will first be reduced by the amount of the state use tax due to be reported on the individual's income tax return for the calendar year in which the refund is requested. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-14-1-.18(3), (5), as amended by Ala. Admin. Monthly, Vol. XXXVII, No. 4 (Jan. 31, 2019), effective Feb. 25, 2019. Effective March 8, 2018, a purchaser or consumer that paid tax directly to a retailer may request a refund of taxes paid. Also, a taxpayer or retailer that remitted tax in excess of what was due, but did not collect the tax from the consumer or purchaser may request a refund. Additionally, a taxpayer or retailer may request a refund of tax paid if the consumer or purchaser paid the tax directly to the taxpayer or retailer, but the taxpayer or retailer may not receive a refund until after the tax has been credited or repaid to the consumer or purchaser. Ala. Code §40-2A-7(c), as amended by 2018 Ala. S.B. 63, effective March 8, 2018; Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-14-1-.18(4), as amended by Ala. Admin. Monthly, Vol. XXXVII, No. 4 (Jan. 31, 2019), effective Feb. 25, 2019. Prior to March 8, 2018, in most cases, individuals or businesses that seek a refund of sales or use taxes they have previously paid must submit the petition for refund jointly with the consumer/purchaser who paid the tax to the taxpayer. If the tax was never collected from the purchaser, or if the tax was previously refunded to the purchaser, then the taxpayer may submit a petition for refund without joint participation by the original purchaser. Ala. Code §40-2A-7(c). A purchaser who is incorrectly charged sales tax on a purchase is required to seek a refund from the Alabama Department of Revenue rather than the retailer. Smith v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 672 So.2d 794 (Ala. Civ. App. 1995), reh'g denied (July 28, 1995), cert. denied (Dec. 22, 1995). However, the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals found in one case that the customer was not required to first request a sales tax refund from the Department of Revenue. There, the customers were entitled to a refund of sales tax paid on internet-access charges under a mobile telecommunications service plan after a nationwide class action lawsuit determined that the taxes had been collected in violation of the Internet Tax Freedom Act (47 U.S.C. §151). The service provider was ordered in the judgment to request refunds from the department on behalf of all Alabama members of the class. The department asserted that it was not obligated to issue the refunds because the service provider had made the request, rather than the customers. The court found that the customers were not required to request the refund because nothing in the statute barred a customer from receiving a refund from the department if the procedures were not followed. Ala. Code §40-21-121(k); Alabama Dept. of Rev. v. Decatur RSA LP, 2016 BL 288157 (Ala. Civ. App. 2016); see Ala. Code §40-2A-7(c). Refund Applied to Outstanding Liability If the department determines that a refund is due, the amount of the refund plus accrued interest will first be credited by the department against any outstanding final tax liabilities the taxpayer owes to the department. Later, any remaining balance will be refunded to the taxpayer. Ala. Code §40-2A-7(c)(4); Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-14-1-.21. Procedures for Appeal If denied, a taxpayer may appeal the denial of a petition for refund within two years of the date the petition was denied by filing a notice of appeal in one of three locations:• the Alabama Tax Tribunal (prior to Oct. 1, 2014, these cases were handled by the Department of Revenue Administrative Law Division); • the Circuit Court in Montgomery County, Alabama; or • the circuit court of the county in which the taxpayer resides or has a principle place of business in Alabama.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Statute of Limitations Refund Requests

2 or 3 Years Taxpayers must submit a petition for refund within three years from the date the return was filed, or two years from the date of the payment of the tax, whichever is later. If no return was timely filed, then the taxpayer must submit a claim for refund within two years of the date of the payment of the tax. Ala. Code §40-2A-7(c)(2)(a). The Department of Revenue must grant or deny all petitions for refund within six months from the date of submission; however, the parties may agree to extend this deadline by written agreement. If the parties do not extend the deadline, and the Department fails to grant a refund within this six-month period, then the petition for refund will automatically be deemed to be denied. Ala. Code §40-2A-7(c)(3). BNA-SUTN AL 31.11.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Statute of Limitations Assessment of Additional Tax

3 Years Under most circumstances, the Alabama Department of Revenue may make an assessment of unpaid sales or use taxes for three years following the due date of the return or the date the return was filed, whichever is later. Ala. Code §40-2A-7(b)(2). If no return is filed, or if a fraudulent return is filed with the intent to evade taxes, the Department of Revenue may make an assessment at any time. Ala. Code §40-2A-7(b)(2)(a). If a responsible party understates the amount of the taxable sales or other tax base by 25 percent or more, the statute of limitations on assessment is extended to a total of six years. Ala. Code §40-2A-7(b)(2)(b). Waiver of the Statute of Limitations The Department of Revenue and the taxpayer may agree in writing to extend the statute of limitations indefinitely as long as the agreement is entered into prior to the expiration of the original statute of limitations. Ala. Code §40-2A-7(b)(2)(i). Suspending the Statute of Limitations The statute of limitations on assessments by the Department of Revenue will be suspended for the period of time during which the taxpayer or the taxpayer's assets are involved in a bankruptcy proceeding and for an additional six months afterward. Ala. Code §40-2A-7(b)(2)(h)(1). Also, if the taxpayer's assets are in the control or custody of a court in any proceeding, bankruptcy or otherwise, the statute of limitations will be suspended while the court proceeding lasts, and for an additional six months afterward. Ala. Code §40-2A-7(b)(2)(h)(2). BNA-SUTN AL 31.11.2.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Civil Penalties

Yes Alabama imposes a range of civil and criminal monetary penalties on individuals or businesses that violate tax regulations relating to sales and use taxes. Ala. Code §40-2A-11. These penalties vary by amount depending on the nature of the violation. After penalties have been imposed, they are assessed and collected in the same manner as other applicable taxes. Ala. Code §40-2A-11(j). Accordingly, the Department of Revenue will issue a preliminary assessment to recover the penalties. At the same time the preliminary assessment is made, or prior to that time, the Department of Revenue must provide the taxpayer with a simple and non-technical description of the basis for the penalty asserted, and the method by which the taxpayer may request an administrative review of the preliminary assessment. Ala. Code §40-2A-3. Failure to Timely File a Return Penalty After taking into account any extensions that have been granted, if a taxpayer fails to file any required monthly or quarterly return on or before the filing deadline, a penalty will be imposed of 10 percent of the unpaid amount shown as tax due on the return or $50, whichever is greater. Ala. Code §40-2A-11(a). Failure to Timely Pay Tax Due Penalty After taking into account any extensions that have been granted, if a taxpayer fails to pay to the Department of Revenue the amount shown on a monthly or quarterly return as tax due, a penalty will be imposed of 10 percent of the unpaid amount. Ala. Code §40-2A-11(b). This penalty applies regardless of whether the amount required to be shown on the return actually is shown on the return. Ala. Code §40-2A-11(b)(1) through Ala. Code §40-2A-11(b)(2). Underpayment Due to Negligence Penalty In situations where a taxpayer remits an amount to the Department of Revenue to fulfill their sales tax obligations and the amount remitted is understated due to negligence or disregard of rules or regulations, a tax penalty will be imposed. This penalty equals 5 percent of the amount that erroneously was underpaid due to negligence. In this context, the term “negligence”means any failure to make a reasonable attempt to comply with the applicable tax laws and regulations. The term “disregard”includes any careless, reckless or intentional disregard. Ala. Code §40-2A-11(c). Underpayment Due to Fraud In situations where a taxpayer remits an amount to the Department of Revenue to fulfill their sales tax obligations and the amount remitted is understated due to fraud, a tax penalty will be imposed. This penalty equals 50 percent of the amount that was underpaid due to fraudulent activity. In this context, the term fraud has the same meaning as that term is defined by I.R.C. §6663, including any current updates to that definition. Ala. Code §40-2A-11(d). Fraud can be established by cumulative, circumstantial evidence. Alabama Administrative Law Judge Ruling Docket No. S. 18-103-CE (Jan. 14, 2019)(owner provided no explanation for consistently underreporting sales by 74% for six years); Alabama Administrative Law Judge Ruling Docket No. S. 16-1315-CE (May 15, 2018)(a failure to keep adequate books and records, failure to furnish auditors with records or access to records, consistent underreporting of tax, and implausible or inconsistent explanations regarding underreporting are strong evidence of fraud). Frivolous Return Penalty If the taxpayer files a “frivolous return” as that term is used in I.R.C. §6702, the taxpayer may be liable for a penalty of up to $250. Ala. Code §40-2A-11(e). Frivolous Appeal Penalty If any appeal to the administrative law division or circuit court is determined to be frivolous or primarily for the purpose of delay or to impede collection of any tax, a penalty of $250 or 25 percent of the tax in question, whichever is greater, is assessed in addition to any tax due. Ala. Code §40-2A-11(f). Multiple Penalties The penalties for failure to timely file a return, failure to timely pay tax, filing a frivolous return, filing a frivolous appeal, or negligence may be asserted against the same taxpayer for the same tax period. If the fraud penalty is asserted, no other penalties may be asserted. Ala. Code §40-2A-11(g). Penalty for Willful Failure to Collect Any individual or business that is required to collect and remit applicable state and local sales and use taxes, and who willfully fails to do so, or willfully fails to account for and pay over the applicable taxes will be subject to a penalty. This penalty equals the total amount of the tax evaded, or not collected, or not accounted for and paid over. This penalty may be imposed in addition to other penalties that may be applicable to the taxpayer's violation. Ala. Code §40-29-73(a). BNA-SUTN AL 31.12.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Criminal Penalties

Yes The Alabama Department of Revenue may impose criminal penalties for violation of the rules and regulations relating to sales and use taxes. Ala. Code §40-23-26(b). Failure to Comply With Sales and Use Tax Laws Any individual or business entity that violates the provisions of the Alabama Code and Regulations relating to sales and use tax will be guilty of a misdemeanor, and if convicted will be fined between $50 to $100, or may be imprisoned in the county jail for not more than six months, or both fined and imprisoned. Each act will constitute a separate offense. Ala. Code §40-23-26(b). Failure to Make Sales Reports Any individual or business that fails to make required sales reports or who fails to keep adequate sales records will be guilty of a misdemeanor, and if convicted will be fined between $25 and $500 for each offense. Ala. Code §40-23-11. Each month wherein the individual or business fails to keep adequate records will constitute a separate offense. Ala. Code §40-23-11. If an individual or business willfully refuses to make the required sales reports, or refuses to allow them to be inspected by the Department of Revenue, then the individual or business will be guilty of a misdemeanor, and if convicted will be fined between $50 and $500 for each offense. Ala. Code §40-23-12. Each month of such willful refusal will constitute a separate offense. Ala. Code §40-23-12. Failure to File Use Tax Return A seller or other person who is required to file a use tax return who fails or refuses to do so, or who fails to file any required supplemental return or other data required by the Department of Revenue, or who renders a false or fraudulent use tax return will be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine that is less than $500. In addition, if a seller or other person who is required to make, render, sign or verify any use tax return or report makes a fraudulent return with the intention of defeating or evading the determination of use tax, the taxpayer will be fined between $300 and $5,000, may be subject to one year in the county jail, or subject to both a fine and imprisonment. Ala. Code §40-23-88. Sales Tax Willful Evasion Penalty If an individual or business that is responsible for collecting and remitting sales or use tax willfully attempts in any way to evade or defeat the payment of any tax, in addition to other penalties, the person or business will be guilty of a felony. If convicted, the party will be fined up to $100,000 for an individual and up to $500,000 for a corporation. The individual may also be subject to imprisonment for up to five years, or subject to both imprisonment and a fine. Ala. Code §40-29-110. Sales Tax Willful Failure to Collect or Pay Penalty If an individual or business that is responsible for collecting and remitting sales or use tax willfully fails to collect, account for and pay over any tax, in addition to other penalties, the person or business will be guilty of a felony. If convicted, the party will be fined up to $10,000, may face imprisonment up to five years, or will be subject to both imprisonment and a fine. Ala. Code §40-29-111. BNA-SUTN AL 31.12.2.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Waiver of Penalties

Yes Where a violation of the state sales and use tax rules and regulations is due to reasonable cause (such as where the taxpayer has acted in good faith), the Department of Revenue may not impose any penalty. If any penalty has been imposed, it must be waived. Ala. Code §40-2A-11(h). The Department of Revenue is required by Alabama law to abate any penalty that is due to erroneous written advice that has been furnished to a taxpayer by an employee of the Department of Revenue. However, certain stated requirements must be met for penalties to be waived in this way:• the employee provided the written advice while acting in his or her official capacity and in good faith; • the taxpayer reasonably relied on the written advice; and • the penalty did not result from the taxpayer's failure to provide adequate or accurate information. Ala. Code §40-2A-4(d). BNA-SUTN AL 31.12.3.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Interest Frequency of Interest Rate Determination

Quarterly In Alabama, the interest rates assessed on underpayments and overpayments of tax are determined quarterly. Ala. Code §40-1-44; I.R.C. §6621. Neither underpayment interest nor overpayment interest is subject to compounding in Alabama. Simple interest is calculated using a daily rate derived from the annual rate. Ala. Code §40-1-44;Alabama Dept. of Rev., Quarterly Interest Rates. BNA-SUTN AL 31.13.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Interest Underpayment Rates Calculation

Federal Rate The interest rate for underpayments of sales and use tax is the rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury under I.R.C. 6621. New interest rates are announced quarterly. Ala. Code §40-1-44(a); Alabama Interest Rates by Calendar Quarter. If an individual or business responsible for collecting and remitting sales or use tax owes tax that is not paid by the due date, interest charges are imposed. Interest is charged from the due date of the tax. The Alabama Department of Revenue calculates interest on such underpayments as well as on overpayments at the same annual rate. Ala. Code §40-1-44; Alabama Interest Rates by Calendar Quarter. Underpayments of County Sales and Use Tax A county that administers its own sales and use taxes may elect to impose interest on underpayments.
