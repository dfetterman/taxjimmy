The application information includes the location of each place of business; however, if there is no place of business, the location is the merchant's place of residence. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-1(c); Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-8-2. Retail merchants that only collect use tax must include the names and address of the merchant's principal employees, location of all places of business, and any other requested information on the application. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-1(h); Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-8-4. An application may be denied if the applicant's business is operated, managed, or controlled by or affiliated with a person who the department has determined failed to file returns or pay taxes, penalties, or interest. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-1(e), as added by 2019 Ind. S.B. 565, effective July 1, 2019. The merchant certificate is valid for two years from the date of issuance or renewal. Ind.

The out-of-state merchants are subject to the same conditions and requirements are Indiana merchants. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-8-5(c). Revocation Generally In some circumstances, the Indiana Code permits or requires the Department of Revenue to revoke a retail merchant's certificate. See Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-7(a) (permissive revocation generally); Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-7(b) (mandatory revocation generally); Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-7(c) (permissive revocation with respect to innkeeper's tax); Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-7(e) (mandatory revocation with respect to unpaid taxes, penalties, fines, interest, or other costs). Permissive Revocation The department may revoke a certificate for good cause if the department gives the certificate-holder at least five days notice. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-7(a). Indiana defines the term “good cause”as:• failure to file a return required under this chapter or for any tax collected for the state in trust; Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-7(a)(1)(A), as amended by 2015 Ind. H.B. 1472, §7, effective July 1, 2015. • failure to remit any tax collected for the state in trust; Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-7(a)(1)(B), as amended by 2015 Ind. H.B. 1472, §7, effective July 1, 2015. • being charged with a violation of Indiana criminal law; Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-7(a)(2), as amended by 2015 Ind. H.B. 1472, §7, effective July 1, 2015. • being subject to a court order under Indiana law; or Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-7(a)(3), as amended by 2015 Ind. H.B. 1472, §7, effective July 1, 2015. • operating as a retail merchant where the merchant's certificate could have been denied prior to its issuance. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-7(a)(4), as added by 2019 Ind. S.B. 565, effective July 1, 2019. Additionally, Indiana permits the department to revoke certificates held by taxpayers subject to an innkeeper's tax. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-7(c). The department may, for good cause and after five days notice, revoke a certificate if:• the certificate-holder is subject to an innkeeper's tax; Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-7(c)(1). and • a board, bureau, or commission files a written statement with the department. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-7(c)(2). The statement must explain that the board-, bureau-, or commission-obtained information indicates that the certificate-holder is out of compliance. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-7(d)(1). It must also state that significant harm will result to the county. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-7(d)(2). The department may revoke a business entity's certificate if a business that is not a cooperative uses the term “cooperative”or “co-op” to describe itself. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-7, as amended by 2017 Ind. S.B. 90, effective Jan. 1, 2017. The Indiana code explains that the department may revoke a certificate before a criminal adjudication or without a criminal charge being filed. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-7(a), as amended by 2015 Ind. H.B. 1472, §7, effective July 1, 2015. Mandatory Revocation There are also some situations in which the department must revoke a retail merchant's certificate. See Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-7(b) (mandatory revocation generally); Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-7(e) (mandatory revocation with respect to unpaid taxes, penalties, fines, interest, or other costs). Under the general mandatory revocation provision, the department must revoke a certificate (after five days notice) if the certificate-holder fails to:• file returns for three years; Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-7(b)(1). or • report the collection of sales and use tax for three years. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-7(b)(2); Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-8-11. There is also a revocation provision regarding unpaid taxes, penalties, fines, interest, or other costs. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-7(e). Under that clause, the department must revoke or suspend a certificate (after at least five days notice)if:• the certificate holder owes taxes, penalties, fines, interest, or other costs that remain unpaid at least 60 days after their due date; Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-7(e)(1). and • the treasurer of the county to which the taxes are due requests the department to revoke or suspend the certificate. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-7(e)(2). However, the department must reinstate a certificate suspended under this subsection if all relevant taxes and penalties due are paid or the county treasurer requests the department to reinstate the certificate. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-7(f). Lastly, there are other revocation provisions that a taxpayer can trigger in fairly narrow situations. Namely, the department must revoke a certificate (after at least five days notice)if the department finds in a public hearing by a preponderance of the evidence that the certificate holder has violated one or more Indiana code provisions regarding professional gambling. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-7(g); see also Ind. Code Ann. §35-45-5-3 (professional gambling generally); Ind. Code Ann. §35-45-5-3.5 (possession of an electronic gambling device; maintaining a professional gambling site); Ind. Code Ann. §35-45-5-4 (promoting professional gambling). Additionally, the department must revoke a certificate (after five days notice)following some situations involving bad checks or sales of synthetic drugs. See Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-7(h) (bad checks); Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-7(i) (synthetic drugs). BNA-SUTN IN 31.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Tax Collection and Remittance

Vendor Retail merchants in Indiana are required to collect and remit sales and use tax the Department of Revenue and in doing so, are considered to be acting as an agent on behalf of the State Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-2-2. The tax is bourne by the customer. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-2-2. However, the retailer must collect the sales tax at the time of the purchase unless the transaction is specifically exempted. A customer's assertion that it will pay use tax after the purchase does not relieve the retailer of its responsibility. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20150317 (June 29, 2016). A retail merchant engaged in business in Indiana includes:• any retail merchant engaged in selling at retail for use, storage, or consumption in Indiana and maintaining, occupying, or using, permanently or temporarily, directly or indirectly, or through a subsidiary, or agent, and office, place of distribution, sales or sample room or place, warehouse or storage place or other place of business in Indiana; and • any retail merchant engaged in selling at retail for use, storage, or consumption in Indiana and having any representative, agent, salesman, canvasser or solicitor operating in Indiana under the authority of the retail merchant or its subsidiary for the purpose of selling, delivering, or taking orders for the sale of any tangible personal property for use, storage, or consumption in Indiana. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-3-3. Any person required to collect sales and use tax is personally and individually liable for the amount of such tax together with interest and penalty. Generally, businesses are to file and remit sales and use taxes, but if the business fails to meet its tax obligations, responsible offers can be held personally liable. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-9-3; see also Ball. v. Indiana Dept. of Rev., 563 N.E.2d 522 (Ind. 1990) (holding that because the taxpayer's personal liability was purely derivative, notice to the corporation was reasonably calculated to apprise the responsible officer of his personal liability for corporate tax, and therefore due process was not violated). Responsible officers include the following:• individual retail merchant, or employees, officers, or members of a corporate or partnership retail merchant; • with the duty to remit state gross retail or use tax. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-9-4. The duty to remit tax to the state is not relieved by the company president allowing another to run the business. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20130143 (finding company president liable for taxes even though he lived in a different part of the state and allowed someone else to run the company). Successor Liability Generally, when a business or its assets are sold, the purchaser or successor does not assume the liabilities of the seller. Indiana Letter of Findings 09-0146; see Sorenson v. Allied Prods. Corp., 706 N.E.2d 1097 (Ind. Ct. App. 1999). However, the Indiana Appellate Court has found there are four exceptions to this rule:• when the purchaser expressly or impliedly agrees to assume the liabilities; • the transaction is an effort to escape liability fraudulently; • the transaction is a de facto merger or consolidation; or • the purchaser is a mere continuation of the seller. Indiana Letter of Findings 09-0146; see Sorenson v. Allied Prods. Corp., 706 N.E.2d 1097 (Ind. Ct. App. 1999). BNA-SUTN IN 31.3.1.

Available The department will grant a taxpayer an extension for filing a tax return if: (1) the taxpayer petitions the department before the original tax due date or obtains an automatic extension pursuant to IC 6-8.1-6-1;and (2) the taxpayer includes a payment of at least 90 percent of the tax reasonably expected to be due on the due date or at least 100 percent of the immediate prior year total tax liability. Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-6-1; Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 15-6-1. The amount of tax “reasonably expected” to be due is defined as ninety percent (90%) of the ultimate tax due. An extension to file a tax return is in no manner to be construed as an extension for the due date of payment of a taxpayer's liability for a tax year. A proper extension to file a tax return will only have the effect of foregoing the penalties imposed for failure to pay a listed tax. The taxpayer will still be liable for the statutory interest for any tax that remains unpaid during an extension period. Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-6-1; Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 15-6-1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Vendor Collection Discounts

0.73%, 0.53%, or 0.26% Merchants who collect and timely remit state gross retail and use tax are entitled to deduct and retain a merchant's collection allowance. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-6-10(a); Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-6-13. The merchant's collection allowance amount is determined by the total retail and use tax liability accrued during the year. The merchant's allowance is determined as follows:• if the gross retail and use tax liability was equal to or less than $60,000 for the preceding calendar year than the allowance is 0.73 percent; • if the gross retail and use tax liability was greater than $60,000 but did not exceed $600,000 the preceding calendar year than the allowance is 0.53 percent; • if the gross retail and use tax liability was greater than $600,000 for the preceding calendar year than the allowance is 0.26 percent.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Certificates Required

Yes Unless a seller receives a properly completed exemption certificate, the merchant must prove that sales tax was collected and remitted to the state or that the purchaser actually used the item for an exempt purpose. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-8-12(d) A merchant can obtain an exemption certificate regarding the following sales: sales for resale/wholesales;manufacturer's sales; sale to organizations that are exempt. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-8(b); Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-8-12. Where a retailer does not collect an exemption certificate from an entity purchasing items for resale, the taxpayer will be found to owe tax on the transaction. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20150513 (June 29, 2016). Exempt organizations may register with the department as a purchaser of property in exempt transactions by filing an application listing its principal location. The department may then issue an exempt organization certificate containing a serial number and the principal location of the exempt organization. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-4. Manufacturers or wholesalers who have registered with the department as purchasers of property in exempt transactions may be issued a manufacturer's or wholesaler's certificate for each place of business listed on the application. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-3. Revocation of Certificate The Indiana Department of Revenue may revoke an exempt organization certificate if for a period of three years the certificate holder fails to file the returns or collect retail or use tax. Prior to revocation the department must give at least five days notice. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-7(b). BNA-SUTN IN 31.8.1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Validity Periods

Depends The validity periods for Indiana exemption certificates depend on the type of certificate. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-5; Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-1(g). Exempt Organizations, Manufacturers and Wholesalers An exemption certificate issued to a exempt organization, manufacturer or wholesaler is valid as long as the business or exempt organization exists. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-5. Another exemption option is a blanket exemption certificate, which covers exempt purchases over a stated period of time. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-8(c). Retail Merchant A certificate issued to a registered retail merchant pursuant to Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-1 is valid for two years from the date on which it was originally issued. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-1(g) Indiana's Department of Revenue may not renew a registered retail merchants certificate if the merchant has outstanding sales and use tax liabilities. The department if required to notify the taxpayer of its intent not to renew the certificate at lease 60 days before the certificate is due to expire. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-1(h); Ind.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Good Faith Requirement

Yes If an individual or business entity sells tangible personal property, and does not collect sales tax because the purchaser has presented to them an apparently valid State Sales and Use Tax Certificate of Exemption, then the person or business will not be held liable for the unpaid sales or use tax. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-8(a); Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement - Certificate of Exemption. Instead, the department will collect or recover the tax due from the party who made the illegal tax-free purchase, or the person who benefited from the illegal tax-free purchase. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-8(a). Taxpayers will be liable for unpaid sales taxes if they did not collect valid exemption certificates at the time of the exempt sales. But if a taxpayer is able to obtain properly executed special exemption certificates, AD-70 forms, after the initial audit is conducted, the department will perform a supplemental audit to determine the validity of any special exemption certificates and will recalculate the taxpayer's liability. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20150145 (Oct. 28, 2015) (taxpayer did not collect exemption certificates at the time of sale and thus was liable for the unpaid sales tax; however, a supplemental audit was being conducted to determine the validity of special exemption certificates obtained after the initial audit was conducted).

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Timely Acceptance

90 Days A seller accepting a proper exemption certificate has no duty to collect or remit the state gross retail or use tax on that purchase. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-8. A seller that accepts an incomplete exemption certificate must obtain all relevant data to complete the exemption certificate within 90 days of a sale or the seller will not be relieved of the obligation to collect tax. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-8. If the seller accepted an incomplete certificate and receives a request from the state's Department of Revenue that the seller substantiate the exemption the seller will have 120 days from the date of the notice to obtain a fully completed certificate or may produce proof by some other means that the transaction was not subject to the state's gross retail or use tax. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-8. BNA-SUTN IN 31.8.5.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Direct Pay Permits

Authorized Direct pay permits are available for retail merchants, manufacturers or wholesalers. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-8-16. Eligible taxpayers may apply for the direct pay permit if the department deems the conditions reasonable because it is impossible for taxpayers to determine at the time of purchase whether the purchased tangible personal property may be exempt. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-8-16. Once a direct pay permit is issued it remains valid unless revoked by the department. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-9(a). A direct payment certificate may be revoked without cause at anytime. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-9(c). The direct pay permit allows the holder to provide the certificate in lieu of paying the state gross retail or use tax and provide the tax directly to the department. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-8-9(b). Construction Materials and Contractors Direct payment permits do not certify that the issuer is entitled to an exemption and may not be issued to or accepted by a contractor unless the contractor is operating as a retail merchant making a retail transaction by disposing of construction material or converting construction material into real property under a time and material contract. Contractors operating under construction contracts or other installation contracts that do not meet the definition of a time and material contract will not be relieved of their use tax obligations by accepting direct pay permits from customers.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Record-Keeping Requirements

3 years Generally, taxpayers must retain records for at least three years after the date the final payment of the tax liability was due. Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-5-4(b). However, if the taxpayer has not filed a return or has filed a fraudulent return there is an unlimited period for record keeping. Moreover, if there is an extension of limitations past the normal three year period the taxpayer must continue to retain the books and records until the assessment period is terminated. Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-5-4(b). Records commonly required to be kept are all source documents necessary to determine the tax, such as invoices, register tapes, receipts, and canceled checks. Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-5-4(a); Indiana Memorandum Decision 04-20181469R (Dec. 27, 2018) (in the context of the protest process in a claim for refund, the taxpayers provided additional explanations and analysis of a previously submitted utility study in order to support a higher exempt electrical usage compared to the Department of Revenue's calculations); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20170880 (Nov. 26, 2018) (taxpayer was able to provide additional records of its exempt Electronic Benefit Transfer transactions and lottery sales which supported its position that the Department of Revenue overstated its assessment of tax due); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20181647 and Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20181335 (Sept. 26, 2018) (calendars and ledgers, in conjunction with incomplete z tapes are sufficient to establish working days for a business, but not average daily sales); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20171258 (Sept. 26, 2018). These documents are referred to as source documents. Bank statements and sales reports prepared by a taxpayer are not source documents. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20130355 (May 28, 2014) (taxpayer was only able to produce bank statements and self-produced reports, which were deemed insufficient for record-keeping purposes); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20130352 (Dec. 25, 2013) (holding that, in the absence of other supporting documentation, bank statements were insufficient to support taxpayer's claims); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20160006 (holding that an S corporation is liable for the sales tax on some sales as it failed to maintain adequate records to demonstrate otherwise). Records that are required to be kept must be available on request for inspection by the department and its authorized agents. Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-5-4(c), (d). Best Information Available When a taxpayer's source documents are incomplete or inadequate, the Department of Revenue may rely on the best information available in arriving at a proposed assessment of sales tax due. Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-5-1(b); Indiana Letter of Findings 03-20180725 (Dec. 16, 2018). Sales Less Than Ten Cents Indiana has provided an income exclusion ration for retail merchants to minimize the taxpayer's recordkeeping requirements for sales less than 10 cents. The ration is determined from sales for every 15 consecutive days during the first quarter of the calendar year. It is possible for retailers with multiple locations to request representative sample of locations. The ration of sales determined to be for less than 10 cents during that period will determine sales that may be excluded from sales tax. The retail merchant is required to keep the exclusion percentage on record for four years. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-6-11. Use Tax Taxpayers must also keep records documenting any sales tax or use tax paid on items they purchase. Without records showing that tax has been paid on a taxable purchase, use tax is owed. Evidence showing that an establishment generally charges sales tax on similar transactions is insufficient; taxpayers must keep records specific to their own purchases. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20170800 (Jan. 31, 2018). BNA-SUTN IN 31.9.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Refunds

Both Generally, a taxpayer is entitled to a refund from the Department of Revenue if state gross retail or use taxes were illegally or erroneously collected by a merchant who then submitted the taxes collected to the state's Department of Revenue, provided the taxpayer did not receive a refund directly from the merchant. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-6-13. A taxpayer from whom taxes were erroneously or illegally collected under the above-described circumstances may apply for a refund explaining the reasons why they are entitled to the refund. The department will consider the claim for refund and hold a hearing if requested by the taxpayer. When the department determines whether a refund should be issued they will mail a copy of the decision to the taxpayer who filed the claim. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-6-13; Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-9-1(a); see Indiana Commissioner's Directive 13. Taxpayers must provide complete and accurate documentation of their refund claims before the hearing begins. Indiana Memorandum Decision 04-20180816R (Aug. 29, 2018) (the department is not required to request additional documentation as the taxpayer is required to submit all relevant documentation in support of its refund when it makes its refund claims); Indiana Memorandum Decision 04-20170246R (May 30, 2018) (indicating that documentation is available upon request by the department is insufficient). The taxpayer must demonstrate that it paid sales tax at the time of the transaction. Indiana Memorandum Decision 04-20180816R (Aug. 29, 2018). Along with a claim for refund, a taxpayer may claim compensatory damages for property unjustly seized and sold to repay a tax debt. When the claim for damages accompanies the refund request, the claims may be considered together upon appeal. Garwood v. Indiana State Dept. of Rev., 24 N.E.3d 548, 2014 BL 366866 (Ind. Tax Ct. 2014). If the taxpayer has paid more tax than is legally due, then the department applies the amount against taxes currently due. If any excess remains, then the overpayment is refunded or credited against future tax liabilities. Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-9-2; see also Miller Pipeline Corp. v. Indiana Dept. of State Rev., 52 N.E.3d 973, 2016 BL 159797 (Ind. Tax Ct. 2016) (pipeline company rebutted some of the department's evidence by demonstrating that it had not credited itself for duplicate payments). To receive a sales tax refund, a claimant must be the same person or entity that created the taxable event. Indiana Final Order 04-20171206R (Apr. 30, 2018) (affirming the department's interpretation of Ind. Code Ann. § 6-8.1-9-1). Thus, a taxpayer seeking a refund of taxes assessed on sales to a separate individual or entity will be denied due to a lack of standing, regardless of the actual source of payment. Indiana Final Order 20181296R (May 31, 2018) (denying a sales tax refund to an LLC for taxes assessed on utilities payments where a former shareholder of the LLC was listed on the invoices); Indiana Final Order 04-20171206R (Apr. 30, 2018) (denying a refund to a hospital for taxes assessed on sales of equipment where a third-party management company acting on behalf of the hospital was listed on the invoices). A retail merchant may not seek a refund of the state gross retail or use tax unless the merchant has refunded the taxpayer the taxes that were erroneously or illegally collected. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-6-14.1; Indiana Final Order 04-20170188R (Feb. 28, 2018) (refund denied where retailer's agent could not provide sufficient documentation that tax was refunded to the customer); Indiana Memorandum Decision 04-20170153R (Nov. 29, 2017) (where a merchant has provided sufficient documentation that sale was exempt and that it refunded the erroneously collected tax to its customer, it is entitled to a refund of sales tax paid); Indiana Memorandum Decision 04-20170553R (Feb. 28, 2018) (denying refund because the merchant did not refund the tax collected to the customer); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20170082 (Feb. 28, 2018) (denying refund because the merchant did not maintain adequate records of refunds to customers). The Indiana Department of Revenue may not issue a refund of collection fees that it incurs as a result of a taxpayer's failure to respond to a proposed assessment. Indiana Final Order 04-20181645 (Sept. 26, 2018). A taxpayer is also entitled to a refund when the department acts to levy and recover monies from the taxpayer in violation of a prior settlement agreement between the parties. To obtain a refund in such case, the taxpayer would have to file a claim for refund and follow the statutory appeal procedures as appropriate. Indiana Memorandum Decision 04-20170905R (April 25, 2018) (taxpayer is entitled to a refund where department used jeopardy warrants that were supposed to be released and withdrawn under a settlement agreement to levy taxpayer's bank accounts). For refund claims filed before July 1, 2015, if an excess tax payment is not refunded or credited against a current or future tax liability within 90 days after the latest of the date the refund claim is filed, the date the tax was due, or the date the tax was paid, then the excess payment accrues interest from the date the refund claim is filed. For refund claims filed after June 30, 2015, the excess payment accrues interest from the latest of: (1)the date the tax was due; (2) the date the tax payment was made; (3)July 1, 2015; or (4) the date the return was filed for the period and tax type for which the refund is sought. Indiana Commissioner's Directive 34. The assignee of an installment contract without recourse is entitled to receive a refund; the assignor is not. Chrysler Fin. v. Indiana Dept. of State Rev., 761 N.E.2d 909 (Ind. Tax Ct. 2002); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20170877R (Feb. 28, 2018). Research and Development Equipment Taxpayers who have invested in research and development equipment are entitled to a 50 percent refund for the gross retail tax paid during June 30, 2005 and July 1, 2007. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-6-16. BNA-SUTN IN 31.10.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Statute of Limitations Refund Requests

3 Years To be eligible for a tax refund, a taxpayer must apply for the refund within three years after the later of the return's due date or payment date. Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-9-1(a); see Indiana Commissioner's Directive 13; J.S. Marten, Inc. v. Indiana Dept. of State Rev., 45 N.E.3d 534, 2015 BL 384302 (Ind. Tax Ct. 2015) (dismissed for failure to state a claim because the refund claim was filed more than three years after payment). Where a taxpayer requests a refund after the three year statute of limitations has passed, the merits of the taxpayer's refund request will not be considered and the request will be denied. Indiana Final Order 01-20170927R (Jan. 31, 2018). The statute of limitations is not tolled by the submission of an incomplete claim for refund. See Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20181838R (Nov. 26, 2018) (denying a refund claim where the taxpayer did not include all of its supporting documentation, including invoices, with the initial refund claim it submitted within the statute of limitations). Effective July 1, 2015, the statute of limitation that governed refund requests relating to sales and use tax paid on utilities used in production was repealed and the statute of limitations for such requests is now governed under Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-9-1. Indiana Commissioner's Directive 13; Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-9-1(a); Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-6-16. BNA-SUTN IN 31.11.1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Statute of Limitations Assessment of Additional Tax

3 Years The Department of Revenue cannot make an assessment of additional tax after three years from the later of the date of the filing of a return or the date the return was due or the end of the calendar year that contains the taxable period for which the return is filed. Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-5-2. When no tax return has been filed that is required by law, or a person files a fraudulent, unsigned, or substantially blank return, there is no time limit on an assessment. Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-5-2(f). Prior to establishing a retail sales tax liability based solely on failure to timely file a return, a person is given notice and 30 days to file if the person is registered under the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement and has no legal requirement to register with Indiana. Indiana Tax Information Sales Tax Bulletin 80. When protesting an assessment of additional tax, a taxpayer needs evidence of when items were first used in a taxable fashion before the department can determine whether use tax should have applied and whether the assessment was made within the statute of limitations. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20130527 (May 28, 2014) (taxpayer did not provide evidence of when “classifiers”were first used in a taxable fashion when protesting an assessment of additional tax). Extension Prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations period, the Department of Revenue and the taxpayer may agree to extend the assessment period to more than one month, based on a signed written agreement. The agreement must contain the date of extension and an agreement that the taxpayer preserve records until the extension terminates. Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-5-2(h). If an agreement to extend the statute of limitations for assessment is entered into under Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-5-2(h), the statute of limitations for filing a refund claim is extended to the same date to which the department may assess additional tax. Indiana Commissioner's Directive 13 BNA-SUTN IN 31.11.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Civil Penalties

Yes Individual retail merchants, or employees, officers or members of retail merchant who have the duty to file and remit sales and use tax are personally liable for the taxes, plus penalties and interest. The penalty is 10 percent of the full amount of tax due unless the taxpayer can demonstrate reasonable cause. Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-10-2.1. Reasonable cause is a fact-based determination that includes the analysis of the nature of the tax involved; judicial precedents for other jurisdictions; information published by the Department of Revenue; and previous contact with the taxpayer on the issue. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20170564R (Aug. 29, 2018) (insufficient evidence that taxpayer's interpretation of the research and development exemption was so egregious as to be willful neglect); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20170027 (July 26, 2017)(penalties were waived for taxpayer who protested an assessment based on uncollected sales tax. However, taxpayer provided documentation that the sales in question were to customers exempt from paying sales tax through exemption certificates that the department had believed to have the wrong meter numbers); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20150626P (April 26, 2017) (penalty was abated where taxpayer misunderstood its business activity constituted a taxable unitary transaction, not a nontaxable service, and promptly corrected its business records to comport with the audit findings. Also, the taxpayer had a good history of compliance); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20160538 (April 26, 2017) (negligence penalty was abated because there was insufficient information to establish willful neglect and the taxpayer had taken specific steps to correct the error and prevent future similar errors); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20160663 (April 26, 2017) (negligence penalty was abated where the taxpayers, a franchisee, actions did not amount to willful neglect when it relied on the Department's audit findings for another unrelated franchisee with the same franchise and represented by the same accountant); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20150439 (April 27, 2016) (abating the negligence penalty on an Indiana car dealership that sold a vehicle to an out-of-state purchaser for delivery at the dealership's address; the dealer made a reasonable effort to demonstrate that it believed it was not liable for tax). A taxpayer may rebut the imposition of the penalty by demonstrating the outstanding taxes were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20181933, 03-20181931, 02-20181932 (Dec. 26, 2018) (negligence penalty abated where taxpayer was able to demonstrate its actions were reasonable); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20160542 (March 9, 2017)(negligence penalty upheld where taxpayer used a sham out-of-state LLC to avoid paying sales tax); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20160641P (Feb. 22, 2017) and Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20160510P (Jan. 25, 2017) (negligence penalty abated based on taxpayer's overall good compliance history with Indiana tax law); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20160458P (Jan. 25, 2017) (negligence penalty abated because taxpayer established that its late remittance of tax was not due to willful neglect but due to a computer software program error maintained by a reputable third-party service provider). If a taxpayer has been audited on similar issues in the past, this weighs against a finding that the taxpayer exercised normal business care. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20160268 (May 31, 2017); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20170481 (March 28, 2018) (waiving the penalty but noting that the taxpayer was now aware of its collection responsibilities in the future). Failing to maintain records as required by Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-5-4 is considered negligence such that a request for a penalty waiver will not be granted. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20140620 (Feb. 24, 2016); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20140623 (Feb. 24, 2016); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20150123 (Feb. 24, 2016); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20150186 (Feb. 24, 2016); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20150187 (Feb. 24, 2016). However, once a taxpayer has been informed of the proper filing procedures as a result of the waiver of penalty for reasonable cause, the taxpayer will be unable to receive a waiver for similar occurrences in the future. Indiana Letter of Findings 01-20140044P (May 28, 2014). Fraudulent Intent to Evade Tax Merchants who file a return with the intent to evade tax are subject to a penalty of 100 percent of the full amount of tax or the amount of tax unpaid. This penalty is in addition to the 10 percent penalty imposed by Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-10-2.1. The department considers whether to impose a penalty for fraudulent conduct on a case-by-case basis. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20140025 (Feb. 25, 2015) (fraud penalty imposed on taxpayer was not abated when taxpayer was put on notice in a prior audit that exemption certificates it was using were invalid and would not relieve the taxpayer from the duty to collect tax). Faulty Payment Submission of a non-cash tax payment upon which the department is unable to obtain the full amount results in a 10 percent penalty of the unpaid tax or the value of the payment, whichever is smaller. The penalty is imposed after a 10-day notice period. Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-10-5. “Zappers” The Indiana Department of Revenue may fine individuals that use tax zapper software. Ind. Code Ann. §35-43-5-4.6;Indiana Dept. of Rev., Using a Tax Zapper? DOR Warns Businesses.

In a qui tam action, Indiana can choose to intervene or can let the relator proceed with the litigation. Ind. Code Ann. §5-11-5.5-5. The relator is considered a party to the action and is entitled to a percentage of the proceeds or settlement if the suit is successful. Ind. Code Ann. §5-11-5.5-6. When suits brought under the FCA allege that a taxpayer made or used, or caused another person to make or use, false records or statements to avoid obligations to pay or transmit sales tax on taxable sales, the circumstances of the alleged fraud must be pleaded with particularity. “Particularity” includes the time, place, the substance of the false representations, the facts misrepresented, and the identification of what was procured by fraud. Failure to state a claim with particularity will fail to raise an issue of material fact. State ex rel. Harmeyer v. The Kroger Co., No. 18A-PL-806, (Ind. Ct. App. Nov. 9, 2018). BNA-SUTN IN 31.12.1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Criminal Penalties

Yes In addition to civil penalties, merchants who file a return with the intent to evade tax may be charged with a Class A misdemeanor. Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-10-4;Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-10-2.1. . The department considers whether to impose a penalty for fraudulent conduct on a case-by-case basis. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20140025 (Feb. 25, 2015) (fraud penalty imposed on taxpayer was not abated when taxpayer was put on notice in a prior audit that exemption certificates it was using were invalid and would not relieve the taxpayer from the duty to collect tax). Unlawful Use of Exemption Certificate A taxpayer who unlawfully gives an exemption certificate to a seller in order to avoid the payment of sales or use tax commits a Class B misdemeanor. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-9-1(a). Moreover, taxpayers who knowingly accept an unlawful exemption certificate commit a Class B misdemeanor. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-9-1(b). Failure to Register Retail merchants who engage in business without obtaining a registered retail merchant's certificate or who engage in business after the revocation or suspension of the certificate commit a Class B misdemeanor. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-9-2. Generally, failing to maintain records as required by Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-5-4 is considered negligence. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20140620 (Feb. 24, 2016); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20140623 (Feb. 24, 2016); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20150123 (Feb. 24, 2016); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20150186 (Feb. 24, 2016); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20150187 (Feb. 24, 2016). A taxpayer may be granted a waiver of the penalty by demonstrating reasonable cause; however, the taxpayer will be unable to receive a waiver for similar occurrences in the future and may be subject to criminal penalties for knowingly failing to meet his or her obligation. Indiana Letter of Findings 01-20140044P (May 28, 2014); Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-9-3. If the individual knowingly fails to meet his or her obligation then he or she commits a Class D felony. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-9-3. A Class D felony is punishable by a minimum two years of imprisonment and in addition may be fined a maximum of$10,000. However, the court may enter judgment as a conviction of a Class A misdemeanor. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 2.2-9-4(d). The 10 percent penalty may be waived if the taxpayer demonstrates that the failure to pay was due to reasonable cause and not with willful neglect. A taxpayer's ignorance of the tax laws is not a reasonable cause. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20130531P. Unlawful Advertising Merchants who advertise a price that offers to: (1) include the state gross retail or use tax; or (2) assume the customer's retail or use tax; or (3) refund part of the state sales or use tax, commit a Class B infraction. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-9-4. Failure to Keep Adequate Records Merchants required to collect gross retail taxes must keep the records open for examination at any reasonable time by the Indiana Department of Revenue. Failure to keep records open for examination or persons who make false entries or keep more than one set of tax records to defraud or evade tax have committed a Class D felony. Ind. Code Ann. §6-2.5-9-8. BNA-SUTN IN 31.12.2.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Waiver of Penalties

Yes The Indiana Department of Revenue has the authority to waive penalties or interest if the taxpayer's failure to pay the full amount of tax was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. Ind. Code Ann. § 6-8.1-10-2.1(d). In order to establish reasonable cause, the taxpayer must demonstrate that it exercised ordinary business care and prudence in carrying out or failing to carry out a duty giving rise to the penalty imposed. The determination of reasonable cause is fact sensitive to the particular facts and circumstances of each case. Ind. Code Ann. § 45-15-11-2(c). See also Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20181394 (Sept. 26, 2018) (where taxpayer had previously been assessed use tax on similar non-exempt items, taxpayer is not entitled to a penalty waiver for failure to self-assess use tax); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20170294P (Nov. 29, 2017). A taxpayer's carelessness, thoughtlessness, disregard or inattention to its duties placed and ignorance of the tax laws, rules and/or regulations does not constitute reasonable cause. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20182435 (Jan. 31, 2019). Failing to keep proper books and records demonstrates that a taxpayer did not exercise ordinary business care. Indiana Letter of Findings 02-20181391 (Feb. 15, 2019); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20181647 and Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20181335 (Sept. 26, 2018). The department will not waive fees related to collection fees charged by a third-party collection agency if the taxpayer fails to respond to a proposed assessment and demand notice, and the department subsequently issues a tax warrant. See Indiana Final Order 04-20171151 (May 21, 2018); Indiana Memorandum Decision 04-20170815 (Feb. 28, 2018). The department may waive interest and penalties if the general assembly enacts a change in a listed tax for a tax period that increases the tax liability for that tax after the due date for the tax period. However, the waiver applies only to the increase in tax liability, and only for 60 days after the change is enacted. Ind. Code Ann. § 6-8.1-3-17(e), as amended by 2018 Ind. H.B. 1316, effective May 14, 2018; Ind. Code Ann. § 6-8.1-10-1(e), as amended by 2018 Ind. H.B. 1316, effective May 14, 2018. BNA-SUTN IN 31.12.3.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Interest Overpayment Rates Calculation

Average yield on state general fund investment + 2% The interest rate on overpayments of tax in Indiana is the same as the rate on underpayments, which is established annually and determined by adding two percentage points to the average investment yield on state money for the state's previous fiscal year, rounded to the nearest whole number. Ind. Code Ann. § 6-8.1-9-2(d); Ind. Code Ann. § 6-8.1-10-1(c). Interest is paid on overpayments that are not refunded or credited against a current or future tax liability within 90 days after the date the refund claim is filed, the tax payment was due or the tax was paid, whichever is latest. Interest on these overpayments accrues from the date the refund claim is filed, if the claim is filed before July 1, 2015; or, if the claim was filed after June 30, 2015, interest accrues from the latest of:• the date the tax payment was due; • the date the tax was paid; or • July 1, 2015.

Last Call for Tax Amnesty 2015 Payment Plans. A taxpayer's failure to satisfy the terms of a Tax Amnesty 2015 payment plan could result in the doubling of the penalties and interest on a taxpayer's liabilities. Last Call for Tax Amnesty 2015 Payment Plans; see also 2015 Tax Amnesty Final Report (for information on collection of retail sales and use tax during the 2015 tax amnesty period). If a taxpayer participates in the amnesty program and complies with all applicable requirements, the department:• will abate and not seek to collect any interest, penalties, collection fees, or costs related to tax liabilities that are paid in full pursuant to the amnesty program; Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 15-11-5(a)(1). • will, after all amnesty eligible liabilities are paid in full, release any liens imposed; Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 15-11-5(a)(2). • will not initiate civil or criminal prosecution against any individual or entity that participates in the amnesty program for nonpayment of amnesty eligible liabilities that are paid in full pursuant to the amnesty program; Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 15-11-5(a)(3). and • will not issue—or, if issued, will withdraw—an assessment, a demand notice, tax due notice, or a warrant for payment for amnesty eligible liabilities paid in full pursuant to the amnesty program. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 15-11-5(a)(4). Taxpayers participating in the program must comply with all amnesty conditions adopted under the department's rules, including foregoing all rights to protest or claim a refund for the taxes paid under the program. Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-3-17, as amended by 2015 Ind. H.B. 1001, effective July 1, 2015. Taxpayers who participated in Indiana's 2005 amnesty program are not eligible to participate again. Ind.

Yes Indiana Department of Revenue allows businesses and individuals to voluntarily register and pay prior tax obligations that were unpaid. Indiana Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Compliance Program. The program provides for a three year look back period for sales and use taxes. The look back period may be extended for the duration of time a taxpayer collected and did not remit sales or use tax. The Department of Revenue agrees to waive penalties in exchange for the taxpayer coming forth voluntarily, unless the taxpayer collected sales and use tax. Participants in the program receive confidentiality. The program is only available to businesses that do not have a physical presence in Indiana but collected tax or had not collected tax when they were required to do so. Indiana Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Compliance Program. Taxpayers who have qualified for the program will arrange a voluntary compliance agreement with the department. Taxpayers may qualify by writing a request that answers the following: • whether the taxpayer is an individual or a business entity; • whether the taxpayer is a calendar or fiscal-year filer; • a general description of the business; • a description of the activities that take place in Indiana; • an estimate of the tax liability for all previous tax periods of sales and use tax; • a statement as to whether the taxpayer has collected and not remitted Indiana sales or use tax; • a statement that the taxpayer has been contacted by the Department of Revenue; • a statement that the taxpayer has not previously filed tax returns in Indiana through a related entity or under a different corporate name. Taxpayers are disqualified from the program and agreement if the following occurs:• the taxpayer has any previous contact with the Department of Revenue; • misrepresentation of any facts set forth in the Disclosure Agreement; • failure to comply with the terms of the agreement. Indiana Dept. of Rev., Qualifying for Indiana Voluntary Compliance Program. Online Sellers Voluntary Disclosure Initiative The Indiana Department of Revenue is offering out-of-state retailers an opportunity to enter into a voluntary disclosure agreement that will limit the look-back period for sales and use tax to calendar year 2017 plus the current period and will include the waiver of penalties. To be eligible, applicants must have inventory located in a third-party Indiana warehouse and must sell to Indiana customers, must have never filed or registered to file sales tax returns in Indiana, and must have never been audited or contacted by the department about delinquent sales tax. Applicants should submit Form VDA-2 to apply for the program, which is in effect until Dec. 31, 2018. If approved, the retailer will have 90 days to get in compliance with registration, filing, and payment requirements.

Does Not Participate Indiana does not participate in the Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program(MVDP). Multistate Tax Commission, Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program. The MVDP allows taxpayers with outstanding tax liabilities in multiple states to negotiate settlements via a process coordinated by the National Nexus Program (NNP) staff of the MTC. Multistate Tax Commission, Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program. To participate in the MVDP, the taxpayer must:• have a minimum good-faith tax liability estimate of $500 or more; • not have been contacted by a state or commission regarding taxes due;and • submit a completed Voluntary Disclosure Agreement (VDA) including taxpayer's contact information, tax year, list of states to receive the proposed VDA, description of taxpayer's activities in each state, and estimate of taxes due. Multistate Tax Commission, Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program. The program is intended to incentivize taxpayers to begin filing and paying taxes in all of the states in which they have substantial nexus. Upon entering into a voluntary disclosure agreement with a state, taxpayers will be required to file returns, pay the tax due and accrued interest on the returns, and register with the state in exchange for waiver of penalties for the entire look-back period. Taxpayers are not charged to participate in the MVDP. BNA-SUTN IN 31.15.3.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Audits

Authorized The Department of Revenue cannot make an assessment of additional tax after three years from the later of the date of the filing of a return or the date the return was due or the end of the calendar year that contains the taxable period for which the return is filed. Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-5-2. The department has the authority to audit any sales and use tax returns. Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-3-12. During the audit procedure the department may make assessments if the tax due was not correctly filed and remitted. Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-5-1. The notice of assessment gives the taxpayer 45 days from the mailing date to pay the assessment or to file a protest. Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-5-1. The audit consists of an examination of the books, records, papers, or other data of the taxpayer that is pertinent to the accuracy of the return. Ind. Admin. Code tit. 45, r. 15-3-5; Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20130203 (upon audit, the department will use the best information available to determine any additional tax due. The best information available includes income statements, tax returns and purchase records). See also Thermo-Cycler Indus., Inc. v. Indiana Dept. of State Rev., 78 N.E.3d 30, 2017 BL 203757 (Ind. Tax Ct. 2017) (upholding an assessment based on the taxpayer's federal tax returns because they were the only information available to the Department and the taxpayer did not provide access to any of its books or records). When a taxpayer successfully files a protest, a hearing is held. At the hearing the taxpayer may provide evidence of error in the assessment. New evidence that was not provided to the auditor is permitted at the hearing. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20130485; Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20120725 (upholding assessment after no evidence was provided at the hearing); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20150416 (March 30, 2016). However, the taxpayer must show that the new evidence would have changed the outcome of the audit. In one ruling, the taxpayer was able to provide invoices showing that it has paid taxes on three transactions during the audit period. However, the taxpayer was unable to show that the department had assessed tax on those transactions. Therefore, the taxpayer was denied a reduction in the total amount of the assessment based on those transactions. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20160143 (June 29, 2016). The burden of proving that an assessment is wrong rests with the taxpayer against whom the assessment is made. Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-5-1(c); see Indiana Dept. of State Rev. v. Rent-a-Center E., Inc., 963 N.E.2d 463, 2012 BL 57404 (Ind. 2012); Lafayette Square Amoco, Inc. v. Indiana Dept. of Rev., 867 N.E.2d 289, 2007 BL 21750 (Ind. Tax Ct. 2007); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20170018 (July 26, 2017) (taxpayer met his burden to prove that a sales tax assessment was incorrect by providing properly completed exemption certificates for both items at issue showing that the taxpayer was exempt from collecting sales tax on the transactions); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20140567 (Sept. 30, 2015) (taxpayer failed to prove that the assessment was made in error). See also Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20170891 (Feb. 28, 2018) (although the department “conceptually” agreed with the taxpayer's argument that certain income was likely not subject to sales tax, taxpayer's protest was denied because they did not provide documentation to substantiate their argument); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20160536 (April 26, 2017) (taxpayer met burden to prove that assessment on use tax was incorrect by demonstrating that a vendor quote was not a separate invoice and that it contained multiple invoices upon which use tax was already paid or assessed). Taxpayers are required to provide documentation and other supporting evidence showing that an assessment is incorrect. Non-cogent arguments are subject to waiver. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20150665 (Sept. 28, 2016) (taxpayer was unable to prove that the assessment proposed by the department was incorrect because of the complete lack of source sales documentation to rebut the department's calculations or support their own);Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20150220 (Jan. 29, 2016)(taxpayer did not submit supporting documentation by the due date to show why the assessment was incorrect; thus, taxpayer did not meet his burden and his protest was denied); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20140107 (Oct. 28, 2015) (taxpayer's documentation and arguments were insufficient to satisfy the burden of proving that the assessment was incorrect); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20140620 (Feb. 24, 2016) (bank statements without accompanying source documentation to verify transactions do not satisfy a taxpayer's burden). During the audit process, the department may use a sample and projection method to arrive at a taxpayer's sales tax compliance rate when a large number of transactions are at issue. Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-3-12; Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20130392 (April 30, 2014) (the sample and projection method was correctly applied); see Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20140435 (Aug. 26, 2015) (denying taxpayer's protest of department's use of statistical sampling during audit because taxpayer failed to demonstrate clear error); see also Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20160268 (May 31, 2017); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20160494 (March 29, 2017); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20170108 (March 28, 2018) (sample can include one-time expenses because they can representative of other one-time expenses outside the sample period). The department can also use “statistical sampling” to determine potential use tax liability. Ind. Code Ann. §6-8.1-3-12(b); Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20130527 (May 28, 2014) (statistical sample was performed correctly). If tax liability is determined using statistical sampling, the taxpayer is not able to request credit for taxes paid on transactions included in the sample. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20160460 (Jan. 25, 2017) (taxpayer's request for a credit against taxes owed due to an exempt transaction was denied because the transaction was a part of the universe of transactions from which the sample was derived). “Sample” invoices are not sufficient evidence to contradict the department's assessment, even when the amount due is determined by sampling. The taxpayer must provide documentation of the actual tax paid on specific purchases rather than providing a “sample” invoice, showing that tax was generally collected on similar purchases. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20160001 (Aug. 31, 2016). If a tax exemption has been allowed in prior audits, a taxpayer may treat that exemption prospectively and claim an exemption in subsequent years. For years after a taxpayer has been put on notice that the department has changed its position regarding the items in question, the exemption is not permitted. Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20140145 (Aug. 27, 2014) (taxpayer's claim for an exemption was allowed during a third audit even though the department had changed its position regarding the items because the exemption had been allowed in two prior audits;the exemption is not allowed for future years).

Code Ann. §6-8.1-9-1(a) and is denied the refund, in whole or in part, may request and administrative hearing within 60 days from the date on which the department's refund denial letter was mailed to the taxpayer. Indiana Commissioner's Directive 13; Indiana Letter of Findings 04-20170456R (Feb. 28, 2018). A refund denial letter becomes the department's final determination if the taxpayer does not exercise his or her right to request and administrative hearing. Indiana Commissioner's Directive 13. If the taxpayer requests an administrative hearing within the prescribed time frame, the Department of Revenue will hold the hearing on the claim for purposes of obtaining and considering additional evidence. Indiana Commissioner's Directive 13.

A taxpayer whose claim is granted in part has sixty days to request an administrative hearing from the mailing date of the department's revised or supplemental refund denial letter, which issues if the refund is granted in part. Indiana Commissioner's Directive 13. The taxpayer is required to exhaust all administrative remedies in order to preserve his or her right to appeal a final administrative decision before the Indiana Tax Court.
