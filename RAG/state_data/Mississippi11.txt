Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Sales Tax

Yes The Mississippi sales tax is a privilege tax imposed for the privilege of engaging or continuing in business or doing business within the state. The tax is levied against the gross proceeds of sales, gross income, or values at the rate of 7 percent. Miss. Code Ann. §27-65-13; Miss. Code Ann. §27-65-17. Any person who is a retailer and engaging in an activity to which the tax applies, is generally liable for the privilege tax imposed, and is required to add the tax due to the sales price or gross income and collect the tax from the purchaser at the time the sales price or gross income is collected. Miss. Code Ann. §27-65-31; see also Miss. Regs. §35.IV.3.06.103, as amended, effective Sept. 1, 2018 (defining “person”). The Mississippi wholesale tax was largely repealed effective Dec. 31, 1983. However, wholesale sales of food and drink for resale through full service vending machines located apart from and not connected with other taxable businesses and wholesale sales of beer remain subject to the wholesale tax. Miss. Code Ann. §27-65-17(1)(i); Miss. Code Ann. §27-65-17(1)(j). Taxable wholesale sales of food and drink include a manufacturer's or wholesaler's withdrawal from inventory of soft drinks, soft drink syrup, other beverages, or food for sale through full service vending machines. Miss. Regs. §35.IV.3.01.100.01(4); Miss. Regs. §35.IV.9.01.100. When a wholesaler sells property taxable under the wholesale tax, the wholesaler is liable for the wholesale tax imposed and must collect the tax from the purchaser to the extent practicable. Miss. Code Ann. §27-65-31. Contractor's Tax A contractor's tax is levied on the total compensation received by contractors under contracts for construction activities performed on real property, where the total contract price exceeds ten thousand dollars. Miss. Code Ann. §27-65-21(1)(a). Liability for payment of the tax is imposed solely on the contractor. Miss. Code Ann. §27-65-21(1)(a); Miss. Code Ann. §27-65-31. However, the portion of the total contract price attributable to engineering services is exempt from the tax, if the services are performed by a professional engineer who is the general or prime contractor or if the total contract price exceeds $100,000,000. Miss. Code Ann. §27-65-21(1)(b)(ii)(2), as amended by 2014 Miss. H.B. 260, effective July 1, 2014. BNA-SUTN MS 1.1.1.

Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Use Tax

Yes Mississippi's use tax is levied and assessed against, and must be collected from, every person for the privilege of using, storing, or consuming tangible personal property or certain digital goods that are acquired in any manner. Miss. Code Ann. §27-67-5. Mississippi's use tax is imposed and levied at the rate of 7 percent on the purchase or sales price or value of the tangible personal property or specified digital goods that are used, stored, or consumed. Miss. Code Ann. §27-67-5(a). Every person who maintains a place of business or is doing business in Mississippi generally is required to collect the applicable use tax from purchasers and remit the tax to the commissioner. Failure to collect use tax from the purchaser does not relieve the seller of liability for the payment of the tax. Miss. Code Ann. §27-67-11(1); see also Miss. Regs. §35.IV.3.06.104, as amended, effective Sept. 1, 2018 (defining “person”). The amount of use tax due is to be added to the sales price of tangible personal property, services, or specified digital products, and such tax due is considered a debt of the purchaser to the seller that is collectible in the same manner as other debts. Miss. Code Ann. §27-67-11(3). Persons who sell tangible personal property or digital goods in Mississippi, but who do not maintain a place of business in the state, may be authorized by the commissioner to collect use tax from the sellers' in-state customers and remit such tax collected. Miss. Code Ann. §27-67-11(2). BNA-SUTN MS 1.1.2.

Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Local Option Sales and Use Tax

Local Tax Authorized Municipalities are authorized by the state of Mississippi to impose a special sales tax at a rate of not more than 1 percent of the gross proceeds of sales or gross income of the business derived from any activities that are taxed at a rate of 7 percent or more under the state sales tax. Miss. Code Ann. §27-65-241(2)(a). The tax is imposed for the privilege of engaging or continuing in business, or doing business within the municipality. The authority to impose the tax will be repealed from and after July 1, 2035. Miss. Code Ann. §27-65-241(9). Before the special sales tax may be imposed, the governing authorities of the municipality must adopt a resolution declaring its intention to levy the tax, setting forth the amount of the tax to be imposed, the purposes for which the revenue collected under the tax may be used and expended, the date the tax becomes effective, and calling for an election to be held on the question. Miss. Code Ann. §27-65-241(3); Mississippi Attorney General Opinion No. 2015-00276 (clarifying that 2015 Miss S.B. 2926 describes the procedure by which a tax increase election is to be held and indicating that the election for tax increases on hotels and restaurants for the City of Vicksburg, will be held by the Vicksburg Election Commission). The date of the election must be set in the resolution. Notice of the election must be published once each week for at least three consecutive weeks in a newspaper published or having a general circulation in the municipality, with the first publication of the notice to be made not less than 21 days before the date fixed in the resolution for the election and the last publication to be made not more than seven days before the election. At the election, all qualified electors of the municipality may vote. The ballots used at the election must have printed on them a brief description of the sales tax, the amount of the sales tax levied, a description of the purposes for which the tax revenue may be used and expended and the words “FOR THE LOCAL SALES TAX” and “AGAINST THE LOCAL SALES TAX” and the voter must vote by placing a cross(X) or check mark opposite their choice on the proposition. Miss. Code Ann. §27-65-241(3); Mississippi Attorney General Opinion No. 2015-00276 (finding that the Legislature authorized a vote (for or against) the sales tax as one issue and there is no authority to list the items separately on the ballot). When the results of the election have been canvassed by the election commissioners of the municipality and certified by them to the governing authorities, the governing authorities must determine and adjudicate whether at least three-fifths of the qualified electors who voted in the election voted in favor of the tax. If at least three-fifths of the qualified electors who voted in the election voted in favor of the tax, then the governing authorities must adopt a resolution declaring the levy and collection of the tax and must set the first day of the second month following the date of the adoption as the effective date of the tax levy. A certified copy of the resolution, together with the result of the election, must be furnished to the state Tax Commission not less than 30 days before the effective date of the tax. Miss. Code Ann. §27-65-241(3). Use of Funds Collected The revenue collected under the special sales tax may be expended for the following purposes:• to enhance police and fire protection services; • to pay for emergency road and street repairs and emergency water system and sewage system projects; • to pay the cost of road and street repair, reconstruction, and resurfacing projects based on traffic patterns, need, and usage; and • to pay the costs of water, sewage, and drainage projects adopted pursuant to a master plan. Miss. Code Ann. §27-65-241(4), as amended by 2011 Miss. S.B. 2839. Certain localities are authorized to levy special taxes on the gross proceeds of restaurant sales and/or room rentals. 2015 Miss. S.B. 2926; Mississippi Notice 72-17-10 (Aug. 28, 2017). Effective December 1, 2018, the City of Grenada levies a one-percent Grenada Tourist and Convention Tax on the gross proceeds of hotels and motels and on the gross proceeds of sales of restaurants and bars from the sale of prepared foods, beer, and alcoholic beverages. Mississippi Notice 72-18-36 (Oct. 24, 2018). This is in addition to the 2-percent Grenada Tourism Tax imposed on the gross proceeds of hotels and motels and the 1-percent Grenada Tourism Tax imposed on restaurants. Mississippi Notice 72-18-36 (Oct. 24, 2018). Effective July 1, 2018, Mississippi exempts admission charges for municipality-created or sponsored events, activities, and entertainments that are: open to the public; and held on property that is publicly owned, leased, used and/or controlled by a municipality. However, municipalities may elect to require that sales tax continue to be imposed. Miss. Code Ann. §27-65-22(3)(o), as amended by 2018 Miss. S.B. 2312, effective July 1, 2018. BNA-SUTN MS 1.1.3.

Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Excise and Replacement Taxes

Yes Excise Taxes Mississippi imposes very few excise taxes that operate in a manner similar to a transactional sales tax. An example of such a tax in Mississippi is the state's privilege tax imposed on every person or company acquiring indebtedness secured by tangible personal property. Miss. Code Ann. §27-21-3. For more information about Mississippi's excise taxes, see the Excise Tax Navigator, beginning at Mississippi 1.1. Replacement Taxes The Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement prohibits member states from imposing a “prohibited replacement tax,” which is a tax outside of the sales and use tax imposed on products defined in the Agreement. Generally, the Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board will make a finding regarding whether a member state has imposed a replacement tax. Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, as amended through October 14, 2016, Section 334 and Rule 334 of the Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Rules and Procedures. Mississippi is not a member of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement. Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Governing Board, State Info. BNA-SUTN MS 1.1.4.

Topic: Imposition of Tax Pending and Trending Developments

Economic Nexus/Exemptions Economic Nexus Beginning Sept. 1, 2018, sellers who lack physical presence nexus in Mississippi but who purposefully or systematically exploit the Mississippi market have substantial economic presence in the state for use tax purposes if their sales into the state exceed $250,000 for the prior twelve months. Miss. Regs. §35.IV.03.09.100; Mississippi Sales and Use Tax Guidance for Online Sellers. Following the decision in Wayfair, the Mississippi Department of Revenue has announced that it is analyzing the decision to determine the impact on Mississippi, but that remote sellers who meet the state's economic threshold for the preceding 12-month period must register with the department and collect sales tax on sales delivered into Mississippi. Mississippi Dept. of Rev., Press Release: Wayfair (June 21, 2018). For more information about sales tax nexus, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, beginning at Mississippi 3.1.2.1. Sales Tax Exemption Changes A significant amount of Mississippi sales and use tax-related legislation was enacted during the first half of 2016, impacting sales and use tax exemptions.
