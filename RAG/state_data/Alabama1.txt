Destination Alabama is a destination-based taxing jurisdiction. Ala. Code §40-23-1(a)(5). The incidence of tax is controlled by the place of delivery, or the time and place title transfers to the purchaser. Ala. Code §40-23-1(a)(5); see Alabama Administrative Law Judge Ruling Docket No. S. 99-475 (Aug. 16, 2000) (retailer not responsible for collecting sales tax on boxes delivered outside of Alabama by common carrier because sales were not closed until delivery was completed outside state). When determining where transfer of title occurs, a common carrier or the U.S. Postal Service is deemed to be the agent of the seller without regard to: any F.O.B. provisions, who selects the method of transportation, and by whom or the method by which freight, postage, or another transportation charge is paid.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Leases and Rentals

Nontaxable Sales and use tax does not apply to leases and rentals in Alabama. Ala. Code §40-12-222; Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-1-.150. The state imposes a license tax on leases and rental agreements in lieu of sales or use tax, because leases and rental agreements are statutorily excluded from the definition of a “sale.” Ala.

When delivery of the goods is carried out by a common carrier, title is deemed to transfer at the point of delivery. Alabama Attorney General Opinion 2017-001 (Oct. 05, 2016). BNA-SUTN AL 4.1.4.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Credit for Tax Paid to Another Jurisdiction

Yes Alabama law states that if a sales or use tax equal to or greater than the amount of the Alabama tax is paid to another state under a requirement of law, the property that is the subject of such tax when imported for use or consumption in Alabama is not subject to the Alabama use tax. Ala. Code §40-23-65; Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-5-.04. However, if the amount of tax paid to the other state is less than the Alabama tax, then the difference between the out-of-state tax and the Alabama tax must be paid. Ala. Code §40-23-65; Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-5-.04. The credit for sales taxes paid to another jurisdiction is applied first against the amount of any use tax due to the state, and any unused portion of the credit is then applied against the amount of any use tax due a subdivision. Alabama Notice: Casual Sales and Use Tax Reciprocity Notice (Sept. 11, 2017). The Commissioner of Revenue may require proof of payment of tax to another state as he or she deems necessary and proper. Ala. Code §40-23-65. Taxpayers are allowed credit for any sales tax that is legally imposed by another state on the purchase of an automotive vehicle.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Temporary Presence, In-Transit Property Tangible Personal Property First Used Out-of-state

Depends When property is purchased for use outside of Alabama, the property is not subject to Alabama use tax if a real and substantial use of the property occurred outside of Alabama before it was brought into and used in Alabama. Ala. Code §40-23-61(c). Further, tangible personal property brought into Alabama by a nonresident for storage, use, or consumption while temporarily within Alabama is not subject to use tax. However, if the property is used in the performance of a contract, the property will be subject to tax. Ala. Code §40-23-62(2), as amended by 2018 Ala. H.B. 242 effective April 6, 2018; see Alabama Administrative Law Judge Ruling Docket No. S. 14-806 (July 9, 2015). BNA-SUTN AL 4.3.1.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Temporary Presence, In-Transit Property Tangible Personal Property Temporarily Stored In-state

Depends In Alabama, the taxability of temporarily stored property depends on where the property came from and where the property is going. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-5-.23(3); Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-5-.23(4)). Tangible personal property temporarily stored in Alabama may be claimed as tax-free if the:• property is temporarily stored in Alabama for use solely outside of Alabama; • purchaser's records reflect an intent to use the property in another state at the time it comes to rest in Alabama; and • records reflect that the property was in fact removed from Alabama. Ala. Admin. Code r. 810-6-5-.23(4). Complete records showing that the property in question was intended for use and was actually used outside the state is required; convincing testimony will not overcome a lack of documentation. Alabama Administrative Law Judge Ruling Docket No. S. 17-1431-CE (Jan. 14, 2019). However, in Alabama Dept. of Rev. v. AAA Cooper Transportation and Action Truck Center, Inc., a common carrier company purchased 1,055 tractors that were delivered to its facility in Alabama, but the company ultimately assigned and transported 835 of the tractors to terminals outside of Alabama. The company sought a refund of the sales tax paid on the 835 tractors, claiming that in transporting the tractors out-of-state, it was acting as a common carrier, and thus an agent of the seller. The company claimed that sale of the tractors had not closed until the company completed delivery to the out-of-state terminals. The Alabama Court of Civil Appeals disagreed with the company's characterization of its role in accepting the tractors and concluded that physical delivery of and title to the tractors were transferred to the company in Alabama, the company accepted delivery of the tractors in its role as a purchaser, and the company subsequently assigned the tractors to out-of-state location. Therefore, the court ruled, the sale of the 835 tractors closed in Alabama and no refund of sales taxes was due. Alabama Dept. of Rev. v. AAA Cooper Transp. & Action Truck Ctr., Inc., 2014 BL 14703, 160 So. 3d 286 (Ala. Civ. App. 2014). Thus, in accordance with AAA Cooper Transportation, a purchaser cannot accept delivery of a product within Alabama in its role as a common carrier and deliver the product to itself outside of Alabama in an attempt to avoid the sales tax. Alabama Dept. of Rev. v. AAA Cooper Transp. & Action Truck Ctr., Inc., 2014 BL 14703, 160 So. 3d 286 (Ala. Civ. App. 2014). Such a transaction is sourced to Alabama, and the purchaser is not entitled to an exemption for transporting the product out-of-state. BNA-SUTN AL 4.3.2.
