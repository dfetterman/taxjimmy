Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Taxation of Property

Taxable Tangible personal property is generally subject to sales and use tax in Kansas. See Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3602; Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3703; Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3667. However, if an exemption applies, tangible personal property may be purchased or used without paying sales or use tax. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3606; Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3704(d); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3703; Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3667; Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board, Taxability Matrix, Kansas (version 2018.0).

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

Depends In Kansas, sales and use tax is imposed on the total amount charged for the sale of tangible personal property including incidental services. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3602(ll); Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3703. The services are still subject to tax even if they are separately stated on the customer's invoice. Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-19-46(a)(2); Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-20-4; Kansas Private Letter Ruling P-2014-006 (Oct. 23, 2014) (engineering services, by themselves, are not taxable, but when included as part of a transaction that provides taxable tangible personal property, they are included in the selling price and are therefore taxable, even when separately stated). Where taxable tangible personal property is transferred in connection with the performance of a nontaxable service, the transaction is nontaxable if the tangible personal property is incidental to the service provided, such as proof-of-concept design drawings. Kansas Opinion Letter O-2009-004 (March 2009). Taxable sales do not include a proof-of-concept design drawing, a prototype, a computer medium containing the concept, or a similar item to the customer who is paying for the design services. Kansas Opinion Letter O-2009-004 (March 2009). However, mixed transactions are taxable in their entirety when the exempt service charged is lumped together with a charge for tangible personal property that is based on the services provided and sold for the customer's use.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Bundled Transactions

Taxable Kansas law imposes a tax on the sale of bundled transactions, when one or more of the products included in such transaction is taxable. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3686(c). A bundled transaction is the retail sale of two or more products, except real property and services to real property, where the products are otherwise distinct and identifiable and the products are sold for one nonitemized price. A bundled transaction does not include the sale of any products in which the sales price varies or is negotiable based on the selection by the purchaser of the products included in the transaction. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3686(a). Distinct and identifiable products do not include packaging, such as containers, boxes, sacks, bags, and bottles or other materials such as wrapping, labels, tags, and instruction guides that accompany the retail sale of the products and are incidental or immaterial to the retail sale. Examples of packaging that are incidental or immaterial include grocery sacks, shoeboxes, dry cleaning garment bags, and express delivery envelopes and boxes. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3686(a)(1). A product provided free of charge with the required purchase of another product is also not a distinct and identifiable product. A product is provided free of charge if the sales price of the product purchased does not vary depending on the inclusion of the product provided free of charge. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3686(a)(2). Also, items included in the definition of sales prices pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3602 are not distinct and identifiable products. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3686(a)(3). The phrase “one nonitemized price”does not include a price that is separately identified by product on binding sales or other supporting sales-related documentation made available to the customer in paper or electronic form, including an invoice, bill of sale, receipt, contract, service agreement, lease agreement, periodic notice of rates and services, rate card, or price list. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3686(a)(3). Transactions Not Considered Bundled Transactions A transaction that otherwise meets the definition of a bundled transaction is not a bundled transaction if the transaction is described by any one of the following statements: Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3686(b). • the retail sale of tangible personal property and a service where the tangible personal property is essential to the use of the service, and is provided exclusively in connection with the service, and the true object of the transaction is the service; Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3686(b)(1). • the retail sale of services where one service is provided that is essential to the use or receipt of a second service and the first service is provided exclusively in connection with the second service and the true object of the transaction is the second service; Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3686(b)(2). • a transaction that includes taxable products and nontaxable products and the purchase price or sales price of the taxable products is de minims where: Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3686(b)(3). - De minims means the seller's purchase price or sales price of the taxable products is 10 percent or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled products; - Sellers must use either the purchase price or the sales price of the products to determine if the taxable products are de minims. Sellers may not use a combination of the purchase price and sales price of the products to determine if the taxable products are de minims; and - Sellers must use the full term of a service contract to determine if the taxable products are de minims. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3686(b)(3). or • the retail sale of exempt tangible personal property and taxable tangible personal property where: Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3686(b)(4). - the transaction includes food and food ingredients, drugs, durable medical equipment, mobility-enhancing equipment, over-the-counter drugs, prosthetic devices, or medical supplies; Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3686(b)(4)(A). and - the seller's purchase price or sales price of the taxable tangible personal property is 50 percent or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled tangible personal property. Sellers may not use a combination of the purchase price and sales price of the tangible personal property when making the 50 percent determination for a transaction. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3686(b)(4)(B). When the provider of a nontaxable service delivers tangible personal property to a customer or client that is necessary to the use of the service, provided exclusively for the service, and the service is the true object of the transaction, the service provider is the consumer and is required to pay sales or use tax on the items at the time of purchase. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3686(b)[(c)]. Bundled Telecommunication Services In the case of a bundled transaction of services that includes telecommunication services, the portion of the price attributable to the nontaxable service is subject to sales and use tax unless the provider can reasonably identify the nontaxable portion of the services from its books and records kept in the regular course of business. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3686(c)[(d)]. BNA-SUTN KS 9.3.2.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Local Jurisdictions, Taxability Distinctions

Differs from State The local sales tax generally applies to the same transaction types and has the same exemptions as the state sales tax; however, certain enumerated transactions are subject to the local but not the state sales tax in Kansas. Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-189, as amended by 2019 Kan. H.B. 2140, effective July 1, 2019; Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-21-6. Specifically, the local sales tax applies to sales of natural gas, electricity, heat and water delivered through mains, lines, or pipes to residential premises for noncommercial use, propane gas, coal, wood, and other fuel sources, as well as, all sales of intrastate telephone and telegraph services for noncommercial uses. Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-189, as amended by 2019 Kan. H.B. 2140, effective July 1, 2019; see Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-189a(a); Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-21-6. The state of Kansas has authorized counties and cities to enact a local sales tax and a corresponding use tax for general or special purposes. Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-187, as amended by 2019 Kan. H.B. 2140, effective July 1, 2019; Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-198(a); Kansas Information Guide KS-1700. To enact the tax, the governing body of the city or county must submit a proposition to the voters who then must approve it by majority vote. Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-187(a), as amended by 2019 Kan. H.B. 2140, effective July 1, 2019; Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-187(b), as amended by 2019 Kan. H.B. 2140, effective July 1, 2019. Any county and city that imposes a local sales tax will also impose a use tax for the privilege of using or storing tangible personal property or a vehicle, which is required to be registered with the state, within a city or county. The local use tax is identical in its application and exemptions as the state compensating use tax. Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-198(a). The rate of the local use tax is the same as the rate of the local sales tax. Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-198(a). The Kansas Department of Revenue maintains a list of the combined state and local sales and use tax rates, including effective dates, for each local taxing jurisdiction in Kansas. Kansas Information Guide KS-1700. A city may levy a retailers’ sales tax for the purpose of providing funds to a technical college provided that it serves a valid public purpose. Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-187, as amended by 2019 Kan. H.B. 2140, effective July 1, 2019; Kansas Attorney General Opinion No. 2014-21 (Dec. 18, 2014). A court would likely defer to the judgment of city electors, if the electors vote to approve a proposed sales tax and determine that providing funds to a technical college serves a valid public purpose. Kansas Attorney General Opinion No. 2014-21 (Dec. 18, 2014). Transportation Development District Sales Tax The state of Kansas has authorized any city or county located within a transportation development district to impose a transportation development district sales tax on tangible personal property and services that are subject to sales tax under the Kansas retailers' sales tax act. The rate of the transportation development tax is not to exceed one percent and must be imposed for the purpose of financing a project in the district. This tax is in addition to any local sales tax. Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-17,141(h); Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-17,145(a). There is no complementary use tax to this sales tax. See Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-17,145(a). Any transportation tax will expire after sufficient tax has been received to pay the cost of the project or no later than the date the bonds issued to furnish the project mature. Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-17,145(a). The application, collection, and administration of the transportation district tax is done in the same manner as the application, collection, and administration of the local sales and use tax. Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-189a(a); Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-17,145(a); Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-17,145(b). Public Improvement District Sales Tax A public improvement district may impose a local sales tax, not to exceed 0.5 percent, for a period of no longer than 10 years to finance the cost of the construction, operation, and maintenance of public infrastructure improvements. Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-17,153(a). There is no local use tax component to this tax. See Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-17,153(a); see also Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-198(a). The sales tax enacted to fund the improvements is imposed upon the selling of tangible personal property at retail or rendering or furnishing services taxable pursuant to the provisions of the Kansas retailers' sales tax act and is in addition to the local sales tax. Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-17,153(a). A public improvement district is a district where the governing bodies of any three or more counties not located in a metropolitan statistical area, as defined by the U.S. Department of Commerce, enter into an agreement for interlocal cooperation to create a public improvement district for purposes of constructing, operating, and maintaining public infrastructure improvements. Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-17,152. The application, collection, and administration of the public improvement district tax is done in the same manner as the application, collection, and administration of the local sales and use tax. Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-189a(a); Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-17,153(a). The rental of hotel rooms and accommodations are subject to the state of Kansas sales and use tax. Kan. Stat. Ann. §79-3603(g). The local sales and use tax applies to the same base as the state sales and use tax. Kan. Stat. Ann. §12-189, as amended by 2019 Kan. H.B. 2140, effective July 1, 2019; Kan. Admin. Regs. 92-21-6. Therefore, the rental of hotel rooms and accommodations are subject to the local sales and use tax. BNA-SUTN KS 9.4.
