Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Sales Tax

Yes The state of Arizona levies a transaction privilege tax on the privilege of doing business in the state. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5008(A). The Arizona transaction privilege tax is imposed directly on a vendor engaged in business within the state of Arizona. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5008(A); Ariz. Admin. Code 15-5-2002. Although sometimes referred to as a “sales tax,” the transaction privilege tax is not a true sales tax, because it is not imposed directly on the sale itself. Arizona Tax Comn. v. Garrett Corp., 291 P.2d 208 (Ariz. 1955). Instead, it is imposed on the income or the gross proceeds of the person selling the property or service. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5008(A); Tower Plaza Invs. Ltd. v. DeWitt, 508 P.2d 324 (Ariz. 1973). However, the transaction privilege tax is similar to a sales tax, because a vendor may pass the obligation onto a consumer, either as an unspecified portion of the overall selling price, or as a separately stated item on a customer's bill. Ariz. Admin. Code 15-5-2210(A). It is important to note that vendors are liable for payment of the transaction privilege tax regardless of whether the obligation is passed onto a customer. Ariz. Admin. Code 15-5-2002. The Arizona Department of Revenue is charged with the collection of the state transaction privilege tax. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5008(A). The transaction privilege tax is imposed on the amount of gross proceeds or gross income derived from a vendor's business activities conducted within the state. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5008(A). Gross proceeds are calculated exclusive of the transaction privilege tax. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5002(A)(1). Thus, if a vendor elects to pass the tax on as a separate charge, gross proceeds will not include any amount collected for the transaction privilege tax. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5002(A)(1); Ariz. Admin. Code 15-5-2210(A)(1). Likewise, if the tax is passed along as an unspecified portion, the vendor may factor out the tax before calculating taxable gross proceeds. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5002(A)(1); Ariz. Admin. Code 15-5-2210(A)(2). For more information on tax basis and factoring out the transaction privilege tax, see Section 6.1 under the Tax Basis section of the Arizona Sales and Use Tax Navigator. A vendor's tax liability is determined by multiplying the applicable rate against the gross proceeds of sales or gross income. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5008(A). The transaction privilege tax is imposed on the following business classifications:• retail; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5061. • transporting; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5062. • utilities; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5063. • telecommunications; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5064. • publication; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5065. • job printing; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5066, as amended by 2012 Ariz. H.B. 2835, effective Aug. 2, 2012. • pipeline; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5067. • private car line; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5068. • commercial lease; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5069, as amended by 2013 Ariz. H.B. 2324, effective July 1, 2013 (for commercial leases of real property between affiliated companies, businesses, persons, or reciprocal insurers, the tax rate is zero) (note: zero rate for state and counties begins on Sept. 13, 2013; zero rate for cities begins July 1, 2013). • transient lodging; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5070, as amended by 2012 Ariz. H.B. 2835, effective Aug. 2, 2012. • personal property rental; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5071. • mining; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5072. • amusement; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5073. • restaurant; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5074, as amended by 2012 Ariz. H.B. 2835, effective Aug. 2, 2012. and • prime contracting. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5075, as amended by 2012 Ariz. H.B. 2835, effective Aug. 2, 2012. It is presumed that all gross proceeds of sales and gross income derived by a person from a taxable business activity comprise the tax base for the business, unless an exemption is established. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5023. Effective Jan. 1, 2015, the transaction privilege tax is no longer imposed under the owner builder sales classification. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5061, amended by 2013 Ariz. H.B. 2111, effective Jan. 1, 2015. BNA-SUTN AZ 1.1.1.

Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Use Tax

Yes Under Arizona law, a state use tax is imposed on tangible personal property purchased from a retailer or utility business that is used, stored, or consumed in Arizona, if the sale was not subject to the transaction privilege tax. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5155(A), as amended by 2018 Ariz. S.B. 1390, effective March 26, 2018; Arizona Publication No. 610. Unlike the transaction privilege tax, which is imposed on the income or proceeds derived from engaging in a taxable business within Arizona, the use tax is imposed directly on the purchaser that is using or storing goods within the state. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5155, as amended by 2018 Ariz. S.B. 1390, effective Aug. 3, 2018; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5161; see Arizona Dept. of Rev., Easier Way to Submit Use Tax Payments (Nov. 22, 2017); Arizona Form AZ-USE V: Arizona Individual Consumer Use Tax Payment Voucher. It is presumed that tangible personal property purchased by any person and brought into Arizona is purchased for storage, use, or consumption within the state. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5152. Additionally, the tax applies to any purchaser that bought tangible personal property for resale, but subsequently used or consumed the property within the state. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5155, as amended by 2018 Ariz. S.B. 1390, effective Aug. 3, 2018. The use tax is imposed at the same rate as the transaction privilege tax at the state level. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5155(B), as amended by 2018 Ariz. S.B. 1390, effective Aug. 3, 2018. However, the tax does not apply if Arizona's or another jurisdiction's sales or use tax has already been imposed at a rate equal to the amount of use tax due on the transaction. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5159(A)(2). Likewise, a purchaser's use tax liability is reduced by any amount of tax paid at a rate less than the rate of Arizona's imposition. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5159(A)(2). Local use tax rates may vary from transaction privilege tax rates imposed at the local level. Use tax liability is not extinguished until the tax has been paid; however, a receipt from a retailer or utility business will relieve the purchaser from any further liability for the tax to which the receipt refers. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5155(F), as amended by 2018 Ariz. S.B. 1390, effective Aug. 3, 2018; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5155(G), as amended by 2018 Ariz. S.B. 1390, effective Aug. 3, 2018. For use tax rates in a specific location, see the tax rate tables provided by the Arizona Department of Revenue. Arizona Transaction Privilege and Other Tax Rate Tables—May 2019.

Topic: Imposition of Tax General Rule - Imposition of Tax Local Option Sales and Use Tax

Local Tax Authorized Arizona authorizes local option transaction privilege taxes; however, Arizona does not have a uniform local rate. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6103. Effective Sept. 30, 2019, subject to certain exceptions, the exemptions from the retail classification in Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5601 supersede all city or town ordinances related to the taxation of business activities. The exceptions to this rule, thereby allowing cities or towns to impose a transaction privileged tax on such items, include:• businesses selling food; • bookstores selling textbooks required by any state university or community college; • certain agricultural materials and livestock, dependant on the population of the city or town, provided the tax was already levied on or before May 1, 2019; • the sale of nonmetalliferous mined materials at retail; • the sale of fine art at an art auction or gallery to nonresidents for use outside the state; or • the sale of a motor vehicle to a nonresident if the purchaser's state does not allow a corresponding use tax exemption or to an enrolled member of an Indian tribe who resides on the Indian reservation established for that tribe. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6017, as added by 2019 Ariz. H.B. 2757, effective Sept. 30, 2019 Effective Dec. 31, 2017, a county, city, or town seeking approval or authorization to assess a transaction privilege tax must hold an election on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November and only in an even-numbered year. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §16-204(F)(4), as amended by 2017 Ariz. S.B. 1152, effective Dec. 31, 2017. The proposition's reach must be coextensive with the authorizing statute. Vangilder v. Arizona Dept. of Rev., No. TX 2017-000663 (Ariz. Tax Ct. July 18, 2018). General County Transaction Privilege Tax Counties in Arizona with a population of less than 1,500,000 people may levy a general excise tax up to 10 percent of the state transaction privilege tax rate of 5.6 percent imposed on each business classification. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6103(A); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6103(B); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5010(A). Thus, the following business classifications, which are subject to the state tax, may be taxed at a maximum rate of 0.56 percent:• transporting; • utilities; • telecommunications; • pipeline; • private car line; • publication; • job printing; • prime contracting; • amusement; • restaurant; • personal property rental; and • retail classification. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5010(A)(1); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5010(G); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6103(A); Sen. Con. Res. 1001, 49th Leg., 6th Spec. Sess (Ariz. 2010);state of Arizona Official Canvass, May 18, 2010 (It should be noted that the 5.6 percent state transaction privilege tax rate is comprised of two components that have scheduled end dates. A temporary 0.6 percent rate is scheduled to terminate on June 30, 2021. In addition, a temporary one percent rate, which initially brought the state rate up to 6.6 percent from 2010 to 2013, terminated on May 31, 2013). Effective Jan. 1, 2015, the transaction privilege tax is no longer imposed under the owner builder sales classification. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5061, amended by 2013 Ariz. H.B. 2111, effective Jan. 1, 2015. Other business classifications may also be taxed but at different maximum rates than those categories taxed at a rate up to 0.56 percent. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5010(A)(1); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6103(B). A county may impose an excise tax up to 0.55 percent on the gross sales or the gross income derived from engaging in the business of transient lodging. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5010(A)(2)(a); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5010(G); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6103(B); Sen. Con. Res. 1001, 49th Leg., 6th Spec. Sess (Ariz. 2010);state of Arizona Official Canvass, May 18, 2010 (It should be noted that this rate also includes the temporary one percent rate that terminated on May 31, 2013). The term “transient”is defined as any person who obtains lodging space or the use of lodging space on a daily or weekly basis, or on any other basis for less than 30 consecutive days. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5070(F); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5070(E). Counties may impose a general excise tax up to 0.3125 percent on the mining business classification. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5010(A)(3); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6103(B). Arizona imposes a rate of 0 percent on the commercial lease classification at the state level. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5010(A)(4); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5069, as amended by 2013 Ariz. H.B. 2324, effective July 1, 2013. Cities, towns, and special taxing districts are prohibited from levying a transaction privilege tax on commercial leases of real property between affiliated companies, businesses, persons, or reciprocal insurers. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6004, as amended by 2013 Ariz. H.B. 2324, effective July 1, 2013 (note: zero rate for state and counties began on Sept. 13, 2013; zero rate for cities began July 1, 2013). To impose the general county excise tax there must be a unanimous vote of the county board of supervisors. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6103(A). Upon approval, the tax is levied on each person engaging or continuing in a business classification subject to tax within the county. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6103(A). Whether a county may levy tax depends on whether or not the person is engaged in business in the county. A retailer is considered to be engaged in business in the county where the sale is made. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5034(A)(9). Determining the location of a sale is a multi-factor analysis. Delivery agreements that specify where title is transferred are not conclusive evidence that a sale was made within the county. Arizona Tax Comn. v. Sw. Kenworth, Inc., 561 P.2d 757 (Ariz. Ct. App., Div. 1 1977); Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Ruling 96-5 (Oct. 22, 1996). Instead, the Arizona Department of Revenue considers all of the following business activities to determine where a retailer is engaged in business: the solicitation of sales, acceptance of orders, maintenance of inventories, processing of orders, and receipts of payments for purchases in the county. Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Ruling 96-5 (Oct. 22, 1996). Prime contractors are not automatically taxable in counties where their businesses are located unless that location is also the place in which their prime contracting activities occur. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5034; Phoenix, Ariz. v. Bentley-Dillie Gradall Rentals, Inc., 665 P.2d 1011 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1983); Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Ruling 96-5 (Oct. 22, 1996). At the end of each month, the state treasurer will distribute the net revenues collected by the Department of Revenue to the treasurer of the county levying the tax. The proceeds are used to support and enhance countywide services. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6103(C). County Transportation Transaction Privilege Taxes In addition to the county general excise tax, the state of Arizona authorizes counties to levy additional taxes in support of county transportation. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6106(A); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6107(A). The various county transportation excise taxes may be imposed if a majority of qualified electors approve the tax in a countywide special election. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6104(A); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6105(A); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6106(A); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6107(A). The county transportation taxes also hinge on the imposition of the state's transaction privilege tax. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6106(A); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6107(A); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5010(A). Generally, the rate of imposition and base is the same as the general county excise tax, with exceptions noted below. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6106(B), as amended by 2012 Ariz. H.B. 2835, effective Aug. 2, 2012; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6107(B); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5010(A). The Arizona Department of Revenue is responsible for collecting the transportation excise taxes. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6106(A); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6107(A). County Transportation Excise Tax Upon voter approval, a regional transportation authority located in any county may impose an excise tax at a rate of 10 percent of the state transaction privilege tax, subject to the following exceptions:• The rate of imposition on the jet fuel classification may not exceed 0.305 cents per gallon. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6106(B)(2); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5352. • The tax base for the utility business classification also includes the use or consumption of electricity or natural gas by retail electric or natural gas customers in the county. The applicable rate for this part of the tax base equals 10 percent of the state rate. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6106(B)(3); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5155, as amended by 2018 Ariz. S.B. 1390, effective Aug. 3, 2018; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5010(A). However, a subsequent reduction to the state transaction privilege tax rate has no effect on a county transportation excise tax that has already been authorized by voter approval. The department must collect the tax at a variable rate if the variable rate is specified in the ballot proposition. However, the department will collect at a modified rate, if approved by a majority of the qualified voters. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6106(C). The tax is effective for a period of no more than 20 years. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6106(E). Any revenue collected from the county transportation excise tax must be distributed as follows:• The revenue must be deposited in the regional transportation fund for counties with a population exceeding 400,000. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6106(D)(1). • Counties with 400,000 or fewer people may deposit revenues into both a regional transportation fund and a public transportation fund. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6106(D)(2). County Transportation Excise Tax for Roads Upon voter approval, a regional transportation authority located in any county may impose an excise tax at a rate of 10 percent of the state transaction privilege tax, subject to the following exceptions: • The rate of imposition on the jet fuel classification may not exceed 0.305 cents per gallon. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6107(A)(2); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5352. • The tax base for the utility business classification also includes the use or consumption of electricity or natural gas by retail electric or natural gas customers in the county. The applicable rate for this part of the tax base equals 10 percent of the state rate. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6107(A)(3); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5155, as amended by 2018 Ariz. S.B. 1390, effective Aug. 3, 2018; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5010(A). The county excise tax is collected by the Department of Revenue and the revenue generated must be distributed to the county's regional area road fund. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6107(B). The tax is effective for a period of no more than 20 years. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6107(C). County Capital Projects Transaction Privilege Tax Counties with a population of less than 2,000,000 may submit a proposed county capital projects tax for approval at a countywide election. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6111(A). The ballot must list each project that will be financed with the tax collected and the estimated cost of each project. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6111(F). Upon voter approval the tax will be imposed on each business classification that is taxed under the state transaction and privilege tax. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6111(A); see also Vangilder v. Arizona Dept. of Rev., No. TX 2017-000663 (Ariz. Tax Ct. July 18, 2018) (the ballot proposition must be coextensive with the authorizing statute). However, the tax base must include the use or consumption of electricity or natural gas within the utilities business classification. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6111(B). The maximum rate of imposition is 10 percent. However, the aggregate of the county capital projects tax, county transportation excise tax, and county excise tax for roads may not exceed 10 percent of the state transaction privilege tax. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6111(A). The Department of Revenue collects the tax and the state treasurer will deposit the net revenue as designated by the county's transportation and capital projects fund. The counties may only use the revenue for capital projects and to purchase, construct and lease buildings, structures, facilities, roads, highways and other real and personal property, including open space and development rights, for the use or benefit of the county. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6111(D). This county excise tax expires when the total amount of estimated costs of all projects have been raised. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6111(F). However, the tax may not continue for a period of greater than 20 years. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6111(C). County Jail Transaction Privilege Tax Upon voter approval, counties with a population of at least 1,500,000 may impose an additional excise tax of not more than 4 percent of the state transaction privilege tax. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6109(A); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5010(A). If the tax is approved, the county may also include the use or consumption of electricity or natural gas in the utilities business classification. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6109(B); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5010(A)(1)(b). The Department of Revenue is responsible for collecting the county jail excise tax. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6109(A). At the end of each month the state treasurer will distribute the net revenue to the treasurer of the county levying the tax. The proceeds generated from this tax must be used to:• finance construction of new adult and juvenile jail facilities; • maintain and operate adult and juvenile jail facilities; or • fund the following for the purpose of reducing the expense of adult and juvenile jail facilities: • implementing an integrated criminal justice information system; • developing regional centers for courts not of record; • implementing differentiated case management for criminal cases in superior court; • consolidating criminal divisions of the superior court in the county to a common location; • expanding pretrial release supervision; • implementing electronic monitoring of preadjudicated defendants; • enhancing substance abuse evaluation and programming; • increasing drug court admissions to include preadjudicated defendants and expanding drug court jurisdiction; • using community based juvenile detention and postadjudication programs. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6109(D). The county jail excise tax may continue until nine hundred million dollars of revenue is generated, but may not extend for a period of more than 20 years. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6109(C); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6109.01(C). Municipalities In addition to county taxes, cities with a population of 3,500 or more people are authorized to adopt a charter and impose taxes within the limits of the charter, the Arizona Constitution, and the general laws not specifically relating to cities. Ariz. Const. Art. 13 §2; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §9-284. Procedures for levying, collecting, and administering municipal taxes must be applied in the same manner as state procedures unless specified by local charter or ordinance. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6002(B). Thus, local municipalities may levy a transaction privilege tax that is similar to the Arizona state transaction privilege tax. However, it should be noted that there are differences between the state and municipally imposed transaction privilege taxes. Often the taxable transactions and exemptions vary between municipalities and do not correspond to the state tax base. For example, the state does not impose a transaction privilege tax on renting or leasing residential real property or the sale of advertising. However, many cities impose tax on these types of transactions. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5010(A); Arizona Publication No. 645; Arizona Transaction Privilege and Other Tax Rate Tables—May 2019; Arizona Dept. of Rev., Transaction Privilege Tax (TPT)/Licensing. Effective April 9, 2019, a city or town that levies a transaction privilege tax on the rental of real property for residential purposes must send a notice by first class mail to each residential transaction privilege tax licensee, at the address of each residential rental property, at least 60 days before the effective date of the new or increased tax. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6011(B), as amended by Ariz. H.B. 2445, effective April 9, 2019. Effective August 2, 2018, a city, town, or other taxing jurisdiction may levy a transaction privilege, sales, use, franchise, or other similar tax or fee on a person engaging in business as a mobile food vendor. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6015(A), as added by 2018 Ariz. H.B. 2371, effective Aug. 2, 2018. Arizona exempts the sale of coal from municipal transaction privilege, sales, use, and similar taxes, provided that on or before December 31, 2022, the following occur:• the Navajo Nation approves the transfer of ownership of the Navajo generating station by a resolution that is adopted by the Navajo Nation council and signed by the president of the Navajo Nation; and • the Navajo Nation delivers the resolution to the governor of Arizona and a copy to the director of the department of revenue. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6004(A)(18), as amended by 2018 Ariz. H.B. 2003, effective Apr. 25, 2018. In an attempt to promote uniformity amongst municipalities in the imposition of local transaction privilege taxes, the Arizona Department of Revenue promulgates the Model City Tax Code(MCTC). Arizona Dept. of Rev., Model City Tax Code, Introduction. The MCTC provides uniform definitions and categories of potentially taxable transactions, while allowing cities options about which transactions to tax. Cities are authorized to adopt all or portions of the MCTC when enacting a local transaction privilege tax. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6053; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6054. All city and town privilege taxes are subject to local voter approval. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6006. Any changes to the MCTC that are not reflected in the official copy on file with the department are void and have no effect. Further, the failure of a city or town to notify the department of a new or different tax rate renders the new or different tax rate void and without effect. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6053, as amended by 2014 Ariz. S.B. 1331, effective retroactively to July 1, 1988 (any claim for refund of transaction privilege tax paid based on the retroactive application of this amendment must be submitted to the department or the appropriate city on or before December 31, 2014). Where a municipality amends their tax code, but does not amend the tax code on file with the City Clerk to reflect the amendment of the franchise credit, did not attach copies of the amendment to the tax code, and did not file an amended tax code reflecting the repeal of the franchise credit with the Municipal Tax Code Commission, Arizona Department of Revenue, or the League of Arizona Cities and Towns, a taxpayer cannot be penalized by following the terms of the published tax code. Arizona Pub. Serv. Co. v. City of San Luis, 2017 BL 274021 (Ariz. Ct. App., Div. 1 2017). All audits conducted by cities must be conducted in accordance with standard audit procedures and policies of the state Department of Revenue. Only the state Department of Revenue is authorized to handle appeals of audit assessments, and the audit of a taxpayer that has locations in two or more cities or towns. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6002(C), as amended by 2013 Ariz. H.B. 2111, effective Dec. 31, 2014. For local transaction privilege tax rates, see Arizona Transaction Privilege and Other Tax Rate Tables—May 2019. For a complete listing of all state and local tax rates, see the Bloomberg Tax Sales and Use Tax Rate-Finder Tool. The Arizona Department of Revenue has an agreement in place with municipalities stating that, when there is a tax rate change by any city or town, here is a 60-day period before implementation allowing taxpayers and Transaction Privilege Tax licensed businesses adequate time to prepare for the tax rate change.

Noncompliance Study The Arizona legislature has directed the Department of Revenue to commission an independent study of the rate of noncompliance by taxpayers subject to the prime contracting classification of the transaction privilege tax under Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5075. 2018 Ariz. H.B. 2416, effective Aug. 3, 2018. Online Lodging Marketplace Effective Jan. 1, 2017, Arizona added an additional transaction privilege tax classification. The new classification subjects the gross charges for an online transient lodging transaction by an online lodging marketplace to a transaction privilege tax at a rate of 5.5 percent. This classification is in effect for online lodging marketplaces that have entered into an agreement with the department to register for purposes of collecting the transaction privilege tax. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5010(A)(2)(b), as amended by 2016 Ariz. S.B. 1350, effective Jan. 1, 2017; see Ariz. State Senate, Amended Fact Sheet for S.B. 1350 (March 9, 2016). An “online lodging marketplace”is a person or business who provides a digital platform for compensation through which an unaffiliated third party offers to rent lodging accommodations to an occupant, including a transient, and the accommodations are not classified as class one property for property tax purposes. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5076(D)(1); see Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-12001 (class one property). If the online lodging marketplace is not registered with the Arizona Department of Revenue and a landlord does not receive documentation that the online lodging marketplace will remit the applicable tax, the landlord is responsible for filing and paying the tax on the gross income received from taxable rentals. Arizona Publication No. 645. Non-Program Cities Effective Jan. 1, 2017, the Arizona Department of Revenue will be the single point of administration and collection of all state, county, and municipal transaction privilege taxes, regardless of business location. Taxpayers will conduct all transaction privilege tax related activities with the department. The transition officially begins with the January 2017 transaction privilege tax return, which is filed in February 2017. If a taxpayer previously reported local transaction privilege taxes to a self-collecting(non-program) city, then the taxpayer's last return to that city is the December 2016 return, filed in January 2017. As non-program cities transition to the centralized reporting, deduction codes that were used by the non-program cities will no longer be valid. Taxpayers will be required to use the applicable three digit deduction codes created for allowable state and city deductions. See Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Changes &News December 2016; Arizona Dept. of Rev., Transition to Centralized Licensing and Reporting for Transaction Privilege Taxes (Nov. 1, 2016); see also Arizona Form TPT-2 Instructions: Transaction Privilege, Use, and Severance Tax Return. The transition to centralized reporting was mandated by 2013 Ariz. H.B. 2111, which was passed on June 25, 2013, and required the department to collect all municipal transaction privilege taxes. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6001, as amended by 2013 Ariz. H.B. 2111, effective Dec. 31, 2014. Though the bill was scheduled to go into effect on Dec. 31, 2014, the department postponed the transition twice before assuming licensing, reporting, and collection responsibility for all cities in January 2017. See Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Changes &News December 2016; Arizona Dept. of Rev., Transition to Centralized Licensing and Reporting for Transaction Privilege Taxes (Nov. 1, 2016); see also Arizona Form TPT-2 Instructions: Transaction Privilege, Use, and Severance Tax Return;Phoenix Tax Division, Transaction Privilege and Use Tax. For more information about the administration of local taxes in Arizona, see the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, at Arizona 31.1.2. Forms The Arizona Department of Revenue issued a Transaction Privilege, Use and Severance Tax Return, Form TPT-2 in June 2016. Arizona Form TPT-2 Instructions: Transaction Privilege, Use, and Severance Tax Return. This new form uses location codes to report information for each business location. Location codes are on vendors'transaction privilege tax licenses. See Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Changes &News May 2016; Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Changes &News April 2016; Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Changes &News March 2016; Arizona Form TPT-2 Instructions: Transaction Privilege, Use, and Severance Tax Return. For filing periods beginning on or after June 1, 2016, Form TPT-2 replaces the former TPT-1 return form. Arizona also introduced a new Form TPT-EZ, a simplified version of the Transaction Privilege, Use, and Severance Tax Return, that can be used in place of Form TPT-2 for Arizona businesses with only one location or jurisdiction for filing periods beginning on or after June 1, 2016.
