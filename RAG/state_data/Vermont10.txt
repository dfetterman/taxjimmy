Vt. Code R. §1.9701(8)-3(A)(2). In the event that the facts of a retail sale do not come within the sourcing rules above, the sale is sourced to the location indicated by an address for the purchaser that is available from the business records of the seller that are maintained in the ordinary course of the seller's business when use of this address does not constitute bad faith. Vt. Code R. §1.9701(8)-3(A)(3). When the sourcing rules above do not apply to a retail sale, the sale is sourced to the location indicated by an address for the purchaser obtained during the consummation of the sale, including the address of a purchaser's payment instrument if no other address is available, provided that the use of that address does not constitute bad faith.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Local Sourcing

Destination Vendors doing business in Vermont must collect Vermont local option sales tax on a destination sales basis. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, ch. 5, §138(c); Vt. Code R. §1.9701(8)-3(A); Vermont Tax Fact Sheet FS-1012. Items are subject to the local tax when the item is delivered or purchased in a town that imposes a local sales tax. If the item is delivered or purchased in a town without a local sales tax, then no local tax is due. See Vermont Tax Fact Sheet FS-1012. Vendors located within the borders of a town that imposes a local option sales tax must collect the town's tax. In addition, vendors who deliver or send items to a customer in a town that levies a local option tax, and out-of-state vendors who are registered under Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement provisions, must collect the town's local option tax. Any vendor with a Vermont sales and use tax certificate of authority may collect local option sales taxes. See Vermont Technical Bulletin TB-37. Charges for shipping taxable tangible personal property to a customer in a town that levies a local option tax are taxable. However, items shipped from a town that levies a tax to a town that does not levy a tax are not subject to local option sales tax because the tax applies on a destination sale basis. Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, §138(c); Vermont Tax Fact Sheet FS-1012; Vermont Technical Bulletin TB-37. The state of Vermont provides the following example of the sourcing rules: BNA-SUTN VT 4.1.4.
