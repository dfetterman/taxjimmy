Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Real Property

Nontaxable Real property is not subject to Arkansas gross receipts tax, nor its compensating use tax, as it is not tangible personal property. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-103(30); Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-301(1); Ark. Code Ann. §26-53-106(a). Real property includes land, all rights and privileges belonging to the land, and all things contained on the land, such as buildings, structures, improvements, and all kinds of fixtures. Ark. Code Ann. §26-1-101(9). Arkansas provides an exemption for fill material provided to a consumer if the business transporting or delivering the fill material obtained the fill material free of charge and the charge to the consumer or user is only for the delivery of the material. Ark. Code Ann. § 26-52-401(30); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 16-430 (Feb. 17, 2016). Initial installation is not taxable in the following circumstances:• when the initial installation is of flooring, motors, electrical appliances or devices, household appliances, or machinery in a newly constructed or substantially modified building or other improvement or structure affixed to real estate; Ark. Regs. GR-9.17(C)(2); see also Arkansas Revenue Legal Counsel Opinion No. 20190314 (May 21, 2019) (”substantially modified” would include gutting and remodeling of an entire building or gutting and remodeling a significant identified area of a building); Arkansas Revenue Legal Counsel Opinion No. 20130505 (May 18, 2018); or • when the installation is for nonmechanical, passive, or manually operated components that become part of the real estate after installation. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-301(3)(B)(viii)(a); Ark. Regs. GR-9.17(C)(3) (exempt items include, but are not limited to, walls, ceilings, doors, locks, windows, glass, heat and air ducts, roofs, wiring, breakers, breaker boxes, electrical switches and receptacles, light fixtures, pipes, plumbing fixtures, fire and security alarms, intercoms, sprinkler systems, parking lots, fences, gates, fireplaces, and similar components which become a part of real estate after installation, except flooring); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 17-033 (May 9, 2017) (the installation of blinds is a nontaxable installation of nonmechanical, passive, or manually operated components); Arkansas Revenue Legal Counsel Opinion No. 20130505 (May 18, 2018) (the installation of vinyl on inner and outer windows and doors and the installation of awnings are nontaxable installations of nonmechanical, passive, or manually operated components).

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal General Rule for Classification

Three or Four-Part Test Fixtures are not subject to Arkansas' gross receipts tax, or its compensating use tax, because fixtures are considered real property. Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-301(1); Ark. Code Ann. §26-52-103(30); Ark. Code Ann. §26-53-106(a); Ark. Code Ann. §26-1-101(9). Installation of a passive fixture device, such as duct work, is not a taxable service. However, the installation of a mechanical fixture device, such as a fan, would be a taxable service. If both passive and mechanical device installations are separately stated on the customer invoice, only the mechanical device installation is subject sales and use tax. If the installations are billed as one lump-sum charge, the entire amount will be subject to sales and use tax. Arkansas Revenue Legal Counsel Opinion No. 20160804 (Aug. 19, 2016). The Supreme Court of Arkansas has outlined a three-prong test to determine whether tangible personal property remains as such, and is taxable, or if it has become a fixture, and thus a nontaxable part of real property. Pledger v. Halvorson, 921 S.W.2d 576, 324 Ar. 302 (Ark. 1996) (citing McIlroy Bank & Trust v. Fed. Land Bank of St. Louis, 585 S.W.2d 947, 266 Ark. 481 (Ark. 1979); Corning Bank v. Bank of Rector, 576 S.W.2d 949, 265 Ark. 68 (Ark. 1979)). The first prong of the test is whether the tangible personal property is annexed or affixed to the real property. The second prong of the test looks to determine whether the tangible personal property are appropriate and adapted to the use or purpose of that part of the real property to which it has been affixed. The third, and most important prong, is whether the party making the annexation or attachment intended to make it permanent. Pledger v. Halvorson, 921 S.W.2d 576, 324 Ar. 302 (Ark. 1996) (citing McIlroy Bank & Trust v. Fed. Land Bank of St. Louis, 585 S.W.2d 947, 266 Ark. 481 (Ark. 1979); Corning Bank v. Bank of Rector, 576 S.W.2d 949, 265 Ark. 68 (Ark. 1979)). The Arkansas Supreme Court has also sometimes used a fourth inquiry to determine whether tangible personal property has become a fixture: whether the property is attached in such a manner that it cannot be removed without serious injury to the real estate. See Sanders v. Putman, 866 S.W.2d 827, 315 Ark. 251 (Ark. 1993); Adamson v. Sims, 151 S.W.3d 23, 85 Ark. App. 278 (Ark. Ct. App. 2004); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 17-292; Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 17-293. BNA-SUTN AR 28.2.1.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal Sale and Installation of Signage

Depends Whether the sale and installation of signage is taxable depends on whether the sign is mechanical or passive and whether it is installed in new construction. Ark. Regs. GR-21(B); Arkansas Revenue Legal Counsel Opinion No. 20170627 (Aug. 7, 2017); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 17–089. The installation of billboard or sign is taxable if it is mechanical or “electrical”(e.g., moving signs, signs with lights, etc.), unless it is installed in a newly constructed building. The installation of detached electrical pole signs is taxable. The seller should charge tax on both the sales price of electrical signs and the cost of the signs' installation. Ark. Regs. GR-21(B); Arkansas Revenue Legal Counsel Opinion No. 20170627 (Aug. 7, 2017); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 17–089; Arkansas Revenue Legal Counsel Opinion No. 20130505 (May 18, 2018) (the installation, alteration, addition, cleaning, refinishing, replacement and repair of an illuminated pylon sign is taxable). If the billboard/sign is passive or non-mechanical (e.g., sign made with non-electrical materials)then the sign will be a tax exempt installation to reality. Since the installation of non-electrical and non-mechanical building signs is a non-taxable service, the seller should charge and remit tax on the sales price of the signs but not on its charge for the installation of the signs because those charges are separately stated. Ark. Regs. GR-21(B); Arkansas Revenue Legal Counsel Opinion No. 20170627 (Aug. 7, 2017); Arkansas Administrative Decision No. 17–089. Removal of old signs is not a taxable service.

Contractors holding a sales tax permit that make retail sales in addition to performing construction work may purchase all construction materials exempt from tax as sales for resale. In this case, the contractor must pay tax on its purchase price of any such materials withdrawn from inventory for use in the performance of nontaxable construction services. Ark. Regs. GR-21(D)(1).

Ark. Code Ann. § 26-53-132. Tangible Personal Property Procured From Outside of Arkansas for Use by Contractors in State Arkansas imposes a compensating use tax upon all tangible personal property procured from outside of the state for storage, use, or consumption by a contractor in the performance of a contract in Arkansas. This tax is imposed upon, but not limited to, machinery, equipment, repair or replacement parts, materials, and supplies. Ark. Code Ann. §26-53-203(a). See Arkansas Revenue Legal Counsel Opinion No. 20160105 (Jan. 27, 2016) (providers of chimney repair services must pay sales tax on the materials they use to repair or clean chimneys).

Effective Jan. 1, 2018, tax also is imposed on specified digital products or digital code procured from outside the state for use by contractors in Arkansas. Ark. Code Ann. §26-53-203, as amended by 2017 Ark. H.B. 1162, §59, effective Jan. 1, 2018. If the tangible personal property being used within the state is leased by the contractor, the contractor is responsible for paying the compensating use tax upon the value of their lease payments. Ark. Code Ann. §26-53-203(b). Where the contractor has already paid sales or use tax to another state, the contractor is exempt from paying the compensating use tax upon tangible personal property used within the state to the extent that the tax paid is equal to or greater than the amount of tax that would be owed to the state.
