Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Certificates Required

Yes When engaging in an exempt transaction, a purchaser or lessee of tangible personal property must generally give the vendor a properly completed certificate of exemption. 72 Pa. Stat. §7237(c). Vendors, or any other person required to collect a tax on the sale or use of tangible personal property or services, must keep the accepted certificate and make it available to the Department upon request. 61 Pa. Code §32.2(a). Exemption Certificate Substitutions, Data Elements Pennsylvania prefers that sellers obtain a properly executed and accepted exemption certificate, but if one is not available, sellers may demonstrate the following evidence to the Department instead:• evidence that the property sold or rented is not tangible personal property or a taxable service; • documentary evidence that the customer is the United States or an instrumentality, the Commonwealth, or a political subdivision or an instrumentality;and • documentary evidence showing that the vendor was required to deliver the property to a place outside of the Commonwealth for a use outside of the Commonwealth, and that the vendor actually did so. 61 Pa. Code §32.2(a). Consequences of Failing to Obtain Exemption Certificates The seller is responsible for obtaining an exemption certificate or else the sale is presumed taxable. If the seller obtains an exemption certificate or other sufficient information, the seller is relieved of any liability for the tax on the transaction. If the seller cannot produce an exemption certificate or other sufficient information substantiating the claimed exemption, the seller will be liable for tax. 72 Pa. Stat. §7201(g); 61 Pa. Code §31.2; see Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1509369 (Aug. 31, 2016); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1416781 (Oct. 4, 2016) (where an exemption certificate accepted in good faith entitled a taxpayer to relief).

Stat. §7268; 61 Pa. Code §32.2(c). Sellers or purchasers who falsely use an exemption certificate may be found criminally guilty of a misdemeanor, subject to a fine of not more than $1,000 and imprisoned for up to one year. 72 Pa.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Multistate Certificates Multistate Tax Commission (MTC) Certificates

Depends Pennsylvania does not accept the Multistate Tax Commission Uniform Sales and Use Tax Certificate as an exemption certificate, but may accept it as a resale certificate under certain circumstances. Multistate Tax Commission, Uniform Sales and Use Tax Exemption Certificate. It is valid as a resale certificate if it contains the purchaser's Pennsylvania Sales and Use Tax eight-digit license number. Multistate Tax Commission, Uniform Sales and Use Tax Exemption Certificate; see 61 Pa. Code §32.3 The Multistate Tax Commission has developed a Uniform Sales and Use Tax Certificate that 38 states have indicated is acceptable for use as a “blanket” resale certificate and for similar purposes. The certificate itself contains instructions on its use, lists the States that have indicated to the Commission that a properly filled out form satisfies their requirements for a valid resale certificate, and sets forth specific limitations on its use. Multistate Tax Commission, website; Pennsylvania Sales, Use and Hotel Occupancy Tax Form REV-717. Construction contractors cannot use blanket certificates to claim the resale exemption.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Good Faith Requirement

Yes A person accepting an exemption certificate must do so in good faith. 72 Pa. Stat. §7237(c). An exemption certificate is accepted in good faith when the certificate provides a valid basis of exemption consistent with the activity of the purchaser and character of the property or service being purchased or which is provided to the vendor by a charitable, religious, educational, volunteer firefighters'relief association or volunteer firemen's organization and contains the organization's charitable exemption number and which, in the case of any purchase costing two hundred dollars ($200) or more, is accompanied by a sworn declaration on a form to be provided by the department of an intended usage of the property or service which would render it nontaxable. 72 Pa. Stat. §7237(c); 61 Pa. Code §32.2(a). Good faith acceptance relieves vendors from liability and shifts the burden of proof regarding fraudulent use to the department. 72 Pa. Stat. §7237(c); see Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1614963 (June 23, 2017) (because taxpayer acted in good faith and its customers were relatively unsophisticated, board used equitable power to allow exemption when exemption certificates contained errors); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1518581 (May 16, 2017) (taxpayer accepted resale certificates from organizations claiming to be exempt entities in good faith); see also Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1604188 (March 6, 2018) (taxpayer granted refund because it accepted exemption certificate in good faith). Good faith presumes a seller is familiar with the laws and regulations regarding the property he or she sells. If a seller should have known that a claimed exemption is not valid, the certificate will not be deemed to have been accepted in good faith. 61 Pa. Code §32.2(b)(2); see Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1704059 (May 15, 2018). BNA-SUTN PA 31.8.4.

60 Days The seller is relieved of liability if the seller obtains a fully completed exemption certificate or captures the relevant data elements within 60 days after the date of sale. 61 Pa. Code §32.2(b)(2)(iii). Undated exemption certificates and exemption certificates submitted more than 60 days after the date of sale are invalid and do not meet the requirements of good faith acceptance. See Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1523895 (April 11, 2017). But see Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1614963 (June 23, 2017) (because taxpayer acted in good faith and its customers were relatively unsophisticated, board used equitable power to allow exemption when exemption certificates contained errors).

Authorized The Pennsylvania Department of Revenue will authorize and issue direct payment permits for circumstances under which it is impossible to determine how the tangible personal property or service will be used. 72 Pa. Stat. §7237(d). If authorized, collection by the vendor is waived and the permit holder is required to pay the department directly. 72 Pa. Stat. §7237(d); 61 Pa. Code §34.4(a); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1511376 (Aug. 26, 2016). Use of Permit The taxpayer will present the certificate of exemption to the vendor at the time of purchase;however, certain purchases do not qualify and will not be exempt. 61 Pa. Code §34.4. Direct payments may not be used in conjunction with the following transactions:• purchase of a motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer or tractor required to be registered with the Bureau of Motor Vehicles; • purchase of prepared food or beverages at an eating place; or • purchase of occupancy or accommodations subject to tax under the hotel occupancy tax provisions of the TRC. 61 Pa. Code §34.4(e). Revocation of Permit Taxpayers may be involuntarily required to return permits to the Department if there is a failure in compliance. In such instance, permit holders must notify vendors within 30 days and keep documentation of the notifications. 61 Pa. Code §34.4(c). Taxpayers may also voluntarily return permits and notify vendors of cancellation. Unless the Department has waived the notification requirement due to a cessation in business or a merger, former permit holders must maintain records of the cancellation notices. 61 Pa. Code §34.4(c). BNA-SUTN PA 31.8.10.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Record-Keeping Requirements

3 Years Every person liable for a sales or use tax is required to keep proper records for at least three years, give statements to the department, and make returns. 72 Pa. Stat. §7271(a); 61 Pa. Code §34.2(e)(3). Generally, proper record keeping includes the retention of invoices and similar documents relating to the acquisition of tangible personal property, evidence that sales or use tax was paid by a party to the transaction, and if a tax was not paid, documentation regarding the circumstances giving rise to the transaction. 61 Pa. Code §34.2. Thus, proper record keeping includes the retention of the following:• all invoices, requisitions, and other documents relating to the acquisition of tangible personal property and services; • records of the amount of tax collected and paid by either the purchaser or the vendor; and • documentation on transactions deemed nontaxable, detailing the nature of the transaction, the reason for non-taxability, dates, times and use of the purchased tangible personal property or services. 61 Pa. Code §34.2(a)(1). Memoranda records created at the time of sale can be in the form of:• receipts; • sales slips; • invoices; • guest checks; • tally sheets; • itemized lists; and • memoranda. 61 Pa. Code §34.2(a)(3). Nonresidents Nonresidents must keep records of the business activity carried on within the Commonwealth, including the amount of sales and use tax collected for taxable transactions occurring within the jurisdiction. Taxpayers may retain records outside of the Commonwealth only by written consent from the Department. The department may require a taxpayer who desires to retain records or tax collections outside of the Commonwealth to assume reasonable out-of-state audit expenses. 72 Pa. Stat. §7271(c). People Collecting Taxes From Others Any person that is required to collect sales and use tax from another person is treated as though he were directly liable for the tax; therefore, the person must keep records, collect sales and use taxes, and pay over any monies to the Department. 72 Pa. Stat. §7271(b). Multiple Businesses Retailers must maintain separate records if they have other business in the Commonwealth not subject to the sales tax. This is necessary to accurately reflect the taxes owed for each business. Failing to maintain separate records subjects the vendor to a tax on the entire purchase price of sales from all businesses. 72 Pa. Stat. §7271(d). Show Promoters All promoters are required to keep accurate records of the date and place of each show. Promoters are permitted to have other vendors display for sale or sell tangible personal property or services subject to tax, so long as the vendor is licensed. 72 Pa. Stat. §7271.1; 72 Pa. Stat. §7248.6(e). If other vendors participate in a promoter's show, the name, address, and sales, use, or hotel occupancy license number must be documented in the promoter's records. Violations will result in the denial or revocation of a promoter's license. 72 Pa. Stat. §7248.6.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Refunds

Both Upon petition, all Pennsylvania taxpayers are entitled to a refund or credit for the overpayment of taxes. 72 Pa. Stat. §7252; Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1614496 (Jan. 26, 2017); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1523383 (Aug. 26, 2016); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1507561 (Aug. 26, 2016). Pennsylvania will not issue a refund of tax, interest, or penalty unless the tax has actually been paid and a petition for such refund has been timely filed. 72 Pa. Stat. §7253; Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1502759 (Aug. 31, 2016); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1513385 (Aug. 26, 2016); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1520991 (Aug. 26, 2016); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1605470 (Aug. 26, 2016); see also Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1422759 (July 19, 2016); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1422760 (July 19, 2016); and Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1422761 (July 19, 2016) (three related decisions denying the taxpayer a sales/use tax refund, because the taxpayer failed to establish that the tax at issue had been paid). Further, a refund is not issued in the event that a refund is requested after a failed attempt to appeal an assessment. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision Nos. 1600255, 1600256 (Oct. 4, 2016) (refund request properly dismissed based on res judicata because the petitioner had previously appealed the assessment for which it sought a refund). Pennsylvania offsets overpayment refunds by any underpayment amounts. See, e.g., Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1510493 (April 28, 2016). Requests for refunds must be supported by documentation. Sales or use tax will not be refunded for transactions for which the taxpayer cannot provide documentation, such as invoices. See Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1515334 (Oct. 4, 2016); Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1507059, 1610071, 1610072 (Sept. 26, 2016) (denying taxpayer refund claim for transactions written off as bad debt because taxpayer failed to produce requested documentation that reconciled the requested refund to the amount of Pennsylvania bad debt written off on its federal returns); see also Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1522469, 1522472, 1522473 (Dec. 20, 2016) Petitioner's refund claim was denied because of a failure to provide the board with adequate proof of payment of tax. Internal accounts payable documentation is insufficient to prove actual payment of tax. Failure to provide accrual records for use tax in addition to sales tax upon request by the Pennsylvania Board of Appeals will result in a refund denial by the Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision Nos. 1611447, 1625762 (Feb. 24, 2017). Only a petitioner who actually paid sales tax is entitled to a refund. A seller may not stand in the shoes of a customer who paid the sales tax, unless it submits an assignment of rights document. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1518271 (Nov. 2, 2016). BNA-SUTN PA 31.10.

Code §35.2(c); see Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1420472 (July 19, 2016) (Board abated major penalties finding that taxpayer's action taking bad deductions on it sales tax returns did not represent a willful attempt to evade tax). Failure to Obtain a License Vendors who maintain a place of business and make taxable sales within the Commonwealth are required to file for a license prior to the commencement of business activities. 72 Pa. Stat. §7208(a). Failure to obtain a license subjects vendors to a penalty of not less than $300 and not more than$1,500. 72 Pa. Stat. §7208(c).

The aggregate penalty amount may not exceed an aggregate amount of 25 percent. In every case, at least $2 will be imposed as a penalty. 72 Pa. Stat. §7266(a); 61 Pa. Code §35.2(b)(1). Understatement If a return filed with the Department understates the amount of tax due, a penalty of 5 percent of the understatement will automatically be added to the assessment. If the understatement exceeds 50 percent, an additional penalty of 5 percent, or a pro-rata fractional amount, for each month the understatement is outstanding is imposed. This further addition may not exceed 25 percent of the understatement. 72 Pa. Stat. §7266(a); 72 Pa. Stat. §7266(b); 61 Pa. Code §35.2(b)(3); see Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1420472 (July 19, 2016) (understatement penalties upheld where audit issues were similar or identical to deficiencies found in an earlier audit of the same taxpayer).

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Waiver of Penalties

Yes Penalties may be waived or abated, in whole or in part, where the petitioner has established that he has acted in good faith, without negligence, and with no intent to defraud. 72 Pa. Stat. §7269. See, e.g., Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1627736 (May 9, 2017) (penalties waived because taxpayer acted in good faith).

Where a taxpayer did not receive a notice that it had failed to file and pay its sales and use tax liability because of a Department of Revenue system upgrade, the taxpayer is entitled to a penalty waiver. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1618995, 1619022 (March 28, 2017). See also Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1703664, 1703665, 1703666, 1703667 (Jan. 23, 2018) (waiving penalty where taxpayer argued she was accidentally unsubscribed from electronic notifications of payment due dates).

Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1600731 (May 16, 2017). Further, taxpayers who have allowed deficiencies to continue for an extended period of time are generally not found to have acted in good faith. Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1619251 (May 16, 2017). However, taxpayers who have been audited previously for similar issues and have significantly improved compliance since the prior audit may still be found to have acted in good faith.

Further, taxpayer who are found to have significantly overpaid tax on other occasions may qualify for an abatement of penalties. See Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1705674 (May 15, 2018). Taxpayers who have not been audited recently may also qualify for an abatement of penalties. See Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1612500 (Jan. 30, 2018) (taxpayer qualified for abatement where it had not been audited since 1995). BNA-SUTN PA 31.12.3.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Interest Underpayment Rates Calculation

Federal Rate The interest rate on underpayments of tax for a given year in Pennsylvania is the same as the federal underpayment rate, established by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, in effect as of Jan. 1 of that calendar year. 72 Pa. Stat. §806. The rate will not fluctuate throughout the year even if there are such changes in the federal rate during the year. 72 Pa. Stat. §806. Interest is imposed on all taxes due to the Commonwealth, including those imposed under the sales and use tax statutes. 61 Pa. Code. §4.3(a). Interest is charged to compensate the Commonwealth for loss of use of the funds while in possession of the taxpayer. See, e.g., Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1627736 (May 9, 2017) (interest not waived despite the fact that taxpayer acted in good faith). Interest is not imposed on penalties, fines, and there is no interest upon interest. 61 Pa. Code. §4.3(b). Additional tax and assessments imposed on taxpayers are not treated as penalties or interest and therefore may be subjected to additional interest charges. 61 Pa. Code. §4.3(b). Interest will accrue on unpaid amounts from the last day the payment is due to the date paid. For unpaid tax determined as a result of a final change or correction of taxable income by the IRS, interest will accrue on the additional tax from 30 days after the taxpayer receives notice of the final change or correction until the tax is paid. 72 Pa.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Voluntary Disclosure Relief

Yes Pennsylvania has a voluntary disclosure program that allows individuals and businesses who were unaware of their tax obligations to come forward and file their tax returns. Pennsylvania Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program. Qualifying taxpayers who recently became aware of outstanding sales and use tax liabilities will only be responsible for satisfying outstanding tax liabilities for up to three years plus the current year. Penalties for those years will be waived, and additional years' liabilities will be forgiven when taxpayers file appropriate returns and remit payment for all taxes and interest due. The program is only available to those taxpayers who are not registered with the Department, and for which no investigations or collection actions have begun. See Pennsylvania Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program; Pennsylvania Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program, Information and Participation Guidelines. Taxpayers must provide the following information to the department to determine eligibility:• the type(s) of tax due; • the date(s)the taxpayer's tax liabilities began; • a detailed description of the taxpayer's activities in Pennsylvania; • an explanation of the taxpayer's failure to file and pay past-due taxes; • verification that the taxpayer has not been previously contacted by the Department concerning the tax liability; and • a completed Business Activities Questionnaire DAS-77. See Pennsylvania Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program; Pennsylvania Dept. of Rev., Voluntary Disclosure Program, Information and Participation Guidelines. Use Tax Voluntary Compliance Program Pennsylvania's Use Tax Voluntary Compliance Program, which is different from the Voluntary Disclosure Program, educates taxpayers and tax preparers about Pennsylvania use tax and waives penalties for taxpayers who self-report and address their tax delinquencies in a timely manner. Pennsylvania Dept. of Rev., Use Tax Voluntary Compliance Program. Under this program, the Department directly contacts many businesses, encouraging them to review purchase histories and self-disclose use tax obligations. Businesses that respond and resolve tax delinquencies by a pre-determined due date, which is found in the correspondence from the department, will have the 5 to 25 percent penalty waived. Taxpayers who do not take advantage of the Use Tax Voluntary Compliance Program to satisfy outstanding obligations may be subject to stricter tax enforcement measures, including billing notices, assessments and liens.

Penalties for those years will be waived, and additional years' liabilities will be forgiven when taxpayers file appropriate returns and remit payment for all taxes and interest due.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Voluntary Disclosure Multistate Tax Commission (MTC) Program

Does Not Participate Pennsylvania does not participate in the Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program(MVDP). Multistate Tax Comn., Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program. The MVDP allows taxpayers with outstanding tax liabilities in multiple states to negotiate settlements via a process coordinated by the National Nexus Program (NNP) staff of the MTC. Multistate Tax Commission, Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program. To participate in the MVDP, the taxpayer must:• have a minimum good-faith tax liability estimate of $500 or more; • not have been contacted by a state or commission regarding taxes due;and • submit a completed Voluntary Disclosure Agreement (VDA) including taxpayer's contact information, tax year, list of states to receive the proposed VDA, description of taxpayer's activities in each state, and estimate of taxes due. Multistate Tax Commission, Multistate Voluntary Disclosure Program. The program is intended to incentivize taxpayers to begin filing and paying taxes in all of the states in which they have substantial nexus. Upon entering into a voluntary disclosure agreement with a state, taxpayers will be required to file returns, pay the tax due and accrued interest on the returns, and register with the state in exchange for waiver of penalties for the entire look-back period. Taxpayers are not charged to participate in the MVDP. BNA-SUTN PA 31.15.3.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Audits

Authorized The Department of Revenue is authorized to examine the books, papers and records of any taxpayer to ascertain their accuracy and completeness. 72 Pa. Stat. §7272. Books and records are to be maintained for as long as the department requires; however, this time period is not to exceed three years from the period to which a record relates. 72 Pa. Stat. §7272. When a taxpayer does not have complete records or if the a review of each transaction in a timely manner would be an undue burden on the department, the department will determine whether to examine all of the records of a taxpayer for an entire audit period, employ a test audit method, or use a combination of audit methods. 61 Pa. Code §8a.5. In determining the audit method, the department considers factors including, but not limited to:• the type of tax under audit; • the nature of the taxpayer's business; • the number of transactions in the population; • the adequacy and availability of the taxpayer's records; • whether the taxpayer's business is cyclical or seasonal; and • whether the significant changes in the taxpayer's business or activities occurred during the audit period. 61 Pa. Code §8a.5; see Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1506904 (Aug. 31, 2016) (finding that auditor's use of error rates from a prior audit to calculate taxpayer's sales tax deficiency over current audit period was appropriate because taxpayer had failed to produce auditable records for the auditor's use and auditor determined that the taxpayer's business activities and sales volume had remained consistent from the prior audit period). Audit Types Examination may be made by desk audit, field audit or another form of audit. 61 Pa. Code §8a.3. For more information on the definition of the type of audits implemented by the Commonwealth, see 61 Pa. Code §8a.1. Liability is determined by the facts contained in the tax return, a tax report or any other information that comes into the department's possession. 61 Pa. Code §8a.4. Audit Findings After an audit is complete, the Department of Revenue will provide the taxpayer with a copy of the work and will:• discuss the findings with the taxpayer; • provide the taxpayer the opportunity to comment in writing; and • explain the procedures for the processing, assessing and appealing of the audit findings. 61 Pa. Code §8a.9. Any person may be examined under oath concerning the enforcement of sales and use. 72 Pa. Stat. §7272. BNA-SUTN PA 31.16.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Appeals

Permitted Following an assessment of sales and use tax by the department, Pennsylvania permits taxpayers to file a petition for reassessment. 72 Pa. Stat. §9702(a), as amended by 2017 Pa. H.B. 542, effective Dec. 29, 2017. For petitions filed on or after Dec. 29, 2017, the taxpayer has 60 days from the department's mailing date. For petitions filed prior to Dec. 29, 2017, taxpayers had 90 days from the department's mailing date. 72 Pa. Stat. §9702(a), as amended by 2017 Pa. H.B. 542, effective Dec. 29, 2017; Pa. Bd. of Fin. & Rev., Petition Form and Instructions. SeePennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1522626 (July 7, 2016) (board dismissed taxpayer's sales and use tax petition for untimely filing because it was filed 145 days after notice was mailed to the taxpayer); see also Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1621175 (Jan. 26, 2017) (petitioner's statement that its third party service provider failed to file an appeal on their behalf within the 90-day period, and that petitioner was not made aware until after the period ended, was insufficient to overcome the time limits imposed by statute). Audit Appeals A taxpayer may appeal the accuracy of a test audit by providing clear and convincing evidence that the method used for selecting a statistical sample or block sample test period and determining the tax liability is erroneous, lacks a rational basis or produces a different result when the complete records are considered. 61 Pa. Code §8a.10; see also Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue Decision No. 1515334 (Oct. 4, 2016). This may be shown by presenting evidence that the projected sample will not yield an estimated precision within 25 percent of the midpoint of an 90 percent two-sided confidence interval.
