Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Food and Food Ingredients Specific Products Alcoholic Beverages

Depends Whether alcoholic beverages are subject to sales and use tax in Massachusetts depends on whether such items are subject to a separate excise tax. See Massachusetts 2010 Statewide Ballot Initiative, Question No. 1, Sales Tax on Alcoholic Beverages, approved by voters Nov. 2, 2010; Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 10-24 (Dec. 14, 2010) (sales and use tax exemption reinstated for alcoholic beverages sold at liquor and package stores and consumed off premises). Since Aug. 1, 2009, Massachusetts law provided for the sales and use tax to be imposed on sales of alcoholic beverages, including beer, wine, and liquor sold at retail in Massachusetts, and on alcoholic beverages purchased by Massachusetts consumers that have not paid sales tax on their purchases. Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 09-11 (July 22, 2009). Effective Jan. 1, 2011, Massachusetts no longer imposes sales and use tax on sales of alcoholic beverages and alcohol where the sale of such beverages and alcohol or their importation into Massachusetts is already subject to a separate excise tax under state law. Massachusetts 2010 Statewide Ballot Initiative, Question No. 1, Sales Tax on Alcoholic Beverages, approved by voters Nov. 2, 2010; Massachusetts Technical Information Release TIR 10-24 (Dec. 14, 2010) (sales and use tax exemption reinstated for alcoholic beverages sold at liquor and package stores and consumed off premises). Liquor License Holders; Innkeepers and Common Victuallers A liquor license holder is a person who has been licensed to sell alcoholic beverages under M.G.L. c. 138. A liquor license holder is a vendor of all alcoholic beverages sold at the licensed premises, and is jointly and severally responsible with any other person selling such beverages on the premises for the collection and payment of the sales and use tax. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.6.5(15)(a). Effective Jan. 1, 2011, Massachusetts law no longer imposes sales and use tax on sales of alcoholic beverages and alcohol where the sale of such beverages and alcohol or their importation into Massachusetts is already subject to a separate excise tax under state law. Massachusetts 2010 Statewide Ballot Initiative, Question No. 1, Sales Tax on Alcoholic Beverages, approved by voters Nov. 2, 2010. The liquor license holder is presumed to be a vendor of all meals sold without alcoholic beverages at the licensed premises. Therefore, the holder is responsible for the collection of sales and use tax. This presumption can be rebutted by showing that the person other than the liquor license holder sold the meals without alcoholic beverages; that this person was not the agent or otherwise acting on behalf of the liquor license holder; and that the two parties agreed previously in writing that the person other than the liquor license holder was responsible for the collection of sales and use tax. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.6.5(15)(a)(3). An innkeeper or victualler is a holder of an innkeeper's or common victualler's license to sell meals without alcoholic beverages. They are the vendor of all meals sold without alcoholic beverages at the licensed premise, and are jointly and severally responsible with any other person selling such meals on the premises for the collection of sales and use tax.

These establishments are commonly referred to as meat markets, farm stores, or fish markets. Generally, the sale of prepared meat, poultry, or fish items heated or in a combination plate is taxable. When the sales of heated prepared meat, poultry, or fish items constitute less than 15 percent of a single store's total gross receipts from sales from all of its activities and the store does not sell other meals, the store is not a restaurant and the sale of prepared meat, poultry, or fish items is not taxable. See Massachusetts Comr. of Rev. v. Jones, 28 Mass. App. Ct. 332 (Mass. App. Ct. 1989). A vendor exempting the sales of items from tax on the basis of this rule must be able to predict accurately the percentage of these sales to the store's total gross receipts for the year, since the vendor is responsible for the tax due even if no tax was collected. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.6.5(6)(b)(5). Prepared Meat, Poultry, and Fish Items: These include meat, poultry, or fish parts or pieces, such as fried chicken wings or barbecued spare ribs. This definition does not include whole cooked, sliced, or unsliced meat, poultry, or fish such as a whole turkey or ham. This definition also does not include sliced meat, poultry, or fish sold by weight such as bologna, cold boiled ham, turkey loaf, etc. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.6.5(6)(b)(5).

The records must include cash register tapes showing each individual transaction, alcoholic beverage bar checks, dining room meals check, and a daily receipt book or record. Vendors must retain copies of sales tax on meals returns filed. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.6.5(16)(a). With respect to maintenance of records for sales of alcoholic beverages, it should be noted that effective January 1, 2011, Massachusetts law no longer imposes sales and use tax on sales of alcoholic beverages and alcohol where the sale of such beverages and alcohol or their importation into Massachusetts is already subject to a separate excise tax under state law. Massachusetts 2010 Statewide Ballot Initiative, Question No. 1, Sales Tax on Alcoholic Beverages approved by voters November 2, 2010. Dining room meals checks must be serially numbered and used in sequence for all meals served with no number being repeated for a one-year period. Dining room meals checks must contain the name and address of the vendor and the wording: “5 percent Mass. Meals Tax” with a space opposite for insertion of the amount of the tax. All dining room meals checks must be securely tied and preserved in dated, daily bundles, and the daily tax recordings must be entered in the vendor's records to substantiate the tax return. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.6.5(16)(b). Caterers must record all catering business in a reservation ledger or book that should state all dates of jobs, names of purchasers, numbers of persons served, price totals, and the proper amount of tax for all meals served.
