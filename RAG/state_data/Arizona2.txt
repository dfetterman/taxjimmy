Topic: Administration and Procedure Agencies Responsible for Administration Local Sales and Use Tax

Arizona Department of Revenue The Arizona Department of Revenue is authorized to collect and administer any use tax, jet fuel excise and use tax, and rental occupancy tax, imposed by any city or town. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6001(A). Effective Jan. 1, 2017, all taxpayers are required to file returns and pay state, county and municipal transaction privilege tax directly to the department. Taxpayers that currently report to a self-collecting, or “non-program,”city will no longer report to such city after the filing of the December 2016 return. Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Changes &News Nov. 2016; Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Changes &News December 2016; Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Changes &News March 2017. Prior to Jan. 1, 2017, 14 large Arizona municipalities, formerly known as non-program cities, administered the collection of their transaction privilege tax and use tax separately from the department. As part of legislation enacted on June 25, 2013, the department was required to implement comprehensive transaction privilege tax simplification, under which all non-program cities has to transition to having their transaction privilege taxes administered by the department. Although the legislation adopting this simplification was effective on Dec. 31, 2014, the department did not fully implement it until Jan. 1, 2017. See Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Changes &News December 2016; Arizona Dept. of Rev., Transition to Centralized Licensing and Reporting for Transaction Privilege Taxes (Nov. 1, 2016); see also Arizona Form TPT-2 Instructions: Transaction Privilege, Use, and Severance Tax Return. Prior to Jan. 1, 2017, non-program cities were required to report the total amount of tax collected before Sept. 1 of the preceding fiscal year. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6001. Procedures for levying, collecting, and administering municipal taxes were the same as the state procedures unless specified otherwise by local charter or ordinance. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6002. County transaction privilege taxes are collected by the department and are subject to state level administration rules and procedures. County excise taxes are reported along with the transaction privilege tax on Form TPT-2.

The department is required to provide an online portal to collect state and municipal transaction privilege tax. The department administers the portal, but it is paid for by cities and towns that have an intergovernmental contract with the department. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-6001.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Tax Collection and Remittance

Seller The transaction privilege tax is imposed directly on the seller, for the purposes of retail sales, or other vendor for the privilege of conducting business in Arizona. The vendor is ultimately liable for the amount due, although the cost may be passed on to the customer, and is responsible for the collection and remittance of the transaction privilege tax. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5008(A). Promoters Promoters of concerts and events are subject to tax. A person is considered a promoter if he or she will profit or lose from an event, and is responsible for paying the performers. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5073;Telephone Interview with Arizona Department of Revenue (June 25, 2010); Arizona Publication No. 604. Promoters or operators of special events (e.g., swap meets, flea markets, fairs, carnivals, festivals, circuses, or other transient selling events) are required to maintain and submit on written request, a list of vendors conducting business on the premises as sellers. A promoter may obtain a transaction privilege and use tax license so that individual vendors do not have to obtain a license. Under such circumstances, all sales must go through the promoter's central cash register and the promoter is responsible for filing and paying the tax. Transient promoters are licensed using their home base as the business location. Promoters with multiple locations must obtain a license for each location, but can choose to obtain separate license numbers for each location or to report on a consolidated license. The Arizona Joint Tax Application is used to apply for the license. Licenses are not transferable. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1105(G); Arizona Information Publication 550. BNA-SUTN AZ 31.3.1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Purchaser Liability

Depends Arizona's transaction privilege tax is imposed directly on the vendor for the privilege of doing business within the state, rather than on the purchaser, although the cost of the tax may be passed on to the purchaser. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5008(A); Ariz. Admin. Code 15-5-2002; Arizona Publication No. 622. However, purchasers who do not pay the transaction privilege tax on a taxable item used, stored, or consumed in Arizona are liable for use tax. The use tax is imposed directly on the purchaser who is using or storing the taxable goods in the state. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5155, as amended by 2018 Ariz. S.B. 1390, effective Aug. 3, 2018; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5161.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Business Owners, Operators

Yes In Arizona, there are no specific transaction privilege tax provisions regarding corporate officer liability. Nonetheless, in Arizona Department of Revenue v. Action Marine Inc., the Arizona Supreme Court held that corporate officers and directors are held to be personally liable for failing to remit transaction privilege taxes. Arizona Dept. of Rev. v. Action Marine, Inc., 181 P.3d 188 (Ariz. 2008). The court broadly construed the word “person” in Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5028 to include corporate officers and directors and not just corporate entities. Arizona Dept. of Rev. v. Action Marine, Inc., 181 P.3d 188 (Ariz. 2008); see Arizona Dept. of Rev. v. Invision Sys., L L C, No. TX 2016-000365, 2018 BL 215100 (Ariz. Tax Ct. Feb. 27, 2018) (company president who signed tax returns and was responsible for management of company's business and affairs held personally liable for unremitted transaction privilege tax based on rule in Action Marine despite his unconfirmed claims that he didn't have control over the monies and his responsibilities at the company had changed); see also Peoria v. Los Olivos Carniseria LLC (Ariz.

To use the ACH credit method the taxpayer must communicate the following payment information to the Data Collection Center:• payor information number; • taxpayer identification number; • tax type; • payment amount; • tax period; • payment sequence number; • taxpayer verification number; • department account number;and • American Bank Association 9-digit number of the receiving bank. Ariz. Admin. Code 15-10-306(B)(2).

Topic: Administration and Procedure Vendor Collection Discounts

1% Arizona allows a credit of 1 percent of the total state transaction privilege tax and state severance tax due for the expenses incurred by the vendor in accounting for and reporting the taxes. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5017(A). The total credit may not exceed $10,000 in any calendar year, as a combined total for all business premises of the taxpayer. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5017(A); Ariz. Admin. Code 15-5-2007(E). This credit is only applicable against the state transaction privilege tax and the state severance tax. Ariz. Admin. Code 15-5-2007(B). If a taxpayer fails to pay the tax due before the amount owed is delinquent, the taxpayer forfeits the credit. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5017(B); Ariz. Admin. Code 15-5-2007(C). Effective July 7 2017, Arizona allows a credit against transaction privilege taxes and severance taxes for expenses incurred by taxpayers in accounting and reporting said taxes as follows:• For filed paper returns - 1 percent of the amount due not to exceed $10,000 in any calendar year for the combined total of all the taxpayer's business premises. • For returns filed electronically (through department's filing program) –1.2 percent of the amount due not to exceed $12,000 in any calendar year for the combined total of all the taxpayer's business premises. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5017, as added by 2017 Ariz. H.B. 2280, effective July 7, 2017(90 days after close of 2017 Legislative Session). BNA-SUTN AZ 31.7.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Certificates Required

Yes The general exemption certificate for the transaction privilege tax is Arizona Form 5000. This form includes exemptions for resale, contracting projects, motor vehicle fuel, food, and manufacturing as well as most exemptions. The vendor is responsible for providing sufficient documentation in support of all deductions. Consequently, the appropriate certificate must be accurately and fully completed by the purchaser. If a vendor has reason to believe that the information in the certificate is not accurate, complete, or applicable to the transaction, the vendor may refuse to accept the certificate. The Department of Revenue may challenge the certificate accepted by a vendor if the department has reason to believe that the information in the certificate is incomplete, inaccurate, or if the exemption claimed is not based on statutory provisions. Ariz. Admin. Code 15-5-2214; Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Procedure 17-1 (April 1, 2017); Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Changes &News April 2017. A business may claim a deduction from the tax base by both:• marking the invoice for the transaction to indicate the deduction from the tax base; and • obtaining a certificate executed by the purchaser indicating: • purchaser's name and address; • precise nature of the purchaser's business; • purpose of the purchase; • necessary facts to establish the appropriate exemption; • purchaser's tax license number, if the purchaser's business requires such license;and • certification that the person executing the certificate is authorized to do so on behalf of the purchaser. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5009(A); Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Procedure 17-1 (April 1, 2017). When a vendor accepts a completed departmental certificate and marks the applicable invoice, the burden of proof lies with the department. However, if the vendor accepts a form of documentation other than a completed departmental certificate, the burden of proof lies with the vendor to establish the right to the deduction. Ariz. Admin. Code 15-5-2214. If a seller is entitled to a deduction, and has both marked the invoice of the transaction to indicate the gross proceeds of sales was deducted from the tax base, and obtained a certificate executed by the purchaser, the department may require the purchaser that caused the execution of the certificate to establish the accuracy and completeness of information. The purchaser is liable for an amount equal to any tax, penalty, and interest that the seller would have been required to pay had the seller not obtained a certificate or marked the invoice of the transaction. If the purchaser cannot establish the accuracy and completeness of the information, the purchaser is liable for an amount equal to any tax, penalty and interest that the seller would have been required to pay. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5009(D). Consequences of Failing to Obtain Exemption Certificates A seller can still establish entitlement to a deduction despite not providing an exemption certificate, however the burden of proof shifts to the seller. If the seller establishes entitlement to a deduction, the department may require the purchaser to establish the accuracy and completeness of the information that was provided to the seller that entitled the seller to the deduction. The purchaser is liable for any tax, penalty, or interest that the seller would have been required to pay, if the purchaser fails to establish the completeness and accuracy of such information. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5009(B)-(D). State Specific Exemption Certificates The Department of Revenue has prescribed a certificate for establishing entitlement to statutory deductions. Copies of this blank prescribed original exemption certificate is acceptable for use. Ariz. Admin. Code 15-5-2214(B)(3). Other commonly used exemption certificates include:• Arizona Form 5000A –Arizona Resale Certificate; • Arizona Form 5000AC - Transaction Privilege Tax Aircraft Exemption Certificate; • Arizona Form 5003 – Commercial Enhancement Reuse District Projects Certificate; • Arizona Form 5004 – Used Oil Burner Exemption Certificate; • Arizona Form 5005 – Prime Contractor's Certificate; • Arizona Form 5006 – Transaction Privilege and Use Tax, Overhead Exemption Certificate; • Arizona Form 5009L – Contractor's Project Certificate; • Arizona Form 5000HC – Transaction Privilege Tax Healthcare Exemption Certificate; • Arizona Form 5000M – Non-TPT Licensed Contractor Certificate(MRRA Project). Arizona also accepts the Border States Uniform Sale for Resale Certificate for sales made to vendors from California, New Mexico, or Texas. This certificate is issued by the Border States’Caucus. Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Procedure 17-1 (April 1, 2017). The burden of proof will lie with the vendor to establish the right to the deduction if the vendor accepts a certificate other than one issued by the Department of Revenue. Ariz. Admin. Code 15-5-2214(D). BNA-SUTN AZ 31.8.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Validity Periods

1 Year Exemption certificates are valid for either a one-time transaction, or for a specified period not to exceed a 12-month calendar year. Vendors must retain copies of exemption certificates on file at all times during the time period specified on each certificate. Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Procedure 17-1 (April 1, 2017). Arizona allows a purchaser to indicate that the certificate is for a specific purchase or specific date or to indicate a ‘blanket' certificate, which gives a time period, chosen by the purchaser and the vendor, during which the certificate is valid. Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Procedure 17-1 (April 1, 2017). Arizona does not consider open-ended exemption certificates to meet the good faith acceptance requirement. Because an annual license renewal is required for persons receiving gross income or gross proceeds subject to the transaction privilege tax, a blanket exemption certificate for up to 12 months is encouraged by the department. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5005; Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Procedure 17-1 (April 1, 2017). BNA-SUTN AZ 31.8.2.

Ariz. Admin. Code 15-5-2214(D); Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Procedure 17-1 (April 1, 2017). MTC certificates may only be used for resale purposes and not to establish entitlement to any other deduction. Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Procedure 17-1 (April 1, 2017). BNA-SUTN AZ 31.8.3.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Direct Pay Permits

Authorized Arizona issues direct pay permits for purposes of the use tax. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5167(A)(1). A person must apply to the department for a use tax direct payment permit. The application must state the name under which the applicant transacts or intends to transact business, the location of the place or places of business where the applicant intends to make direct payment of use taxes, and any other information required by the Department of Revenue, and be signed by the statutorily required person. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5167(A)(1). In addition, the taxpayer must agree to self-assess and pay directly to the Department of Revenue any use tax liability incurred and certify to the department that the taxpayer purchased tangible personal property for its own use at an aggregate cost of $500,000 or more during the immediately preceding calendar year. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5167(A). The department may require a taxpayer to file a bond to secure the payment of tax, penalty, or interest that may become due, if the department deems it necessary to protect the revenues. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5167(C). A taxpayer who holds a valid use tax direct payment permit must self-assess and pay use tax directly to the department and report the tax on a tax return. A holder of a use tax direct payment certificate may use a permit at any retailer if:• the certificate is in a form prescribed by the department and signed by and bears the name, address and permit number of the holder of the permit; • the certificate is effective until the permit holder revises or withdraws the certificate or until the retailer receives actual notice that the department has revoked the permit; and • the certificate relieves the retailer of the duty to collect use tax only if taken in good faith from a person who holds a use tax direct payment permit. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5167(E). A purchaser holding a direct payment permit who issues a use tax direct payment certificate that is accepted in good faith by a retailer of tangible personal property is liable for use tax and related interest and penalties with respect to any transaction that the department later determines subjects the vendor to the transaction privilege tax. In such a situation, the vendor is relieved of the duty to pay transaction privilege tax. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5167(E) BNA-SUTN AZ 31.8.10.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Record-Keeping Requirements

4 Years Every person who is subject to transaction privilege tax is required to keep and preserve copies of filed tax returns, including any attachments to the tax return, any signature documents used for the tax return, suitable records and other books and accounts necessary to determine the tax for which the person is liable for the applicable statute of limitations period. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1105(D); Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Decision No. 14C-201400004S-REV (holding that taxpayer not maintaining proper records could be taxed based on bank deposits). A vendor collecting use tax from a purchaser must maintain records for the statute of limitations for assessment, which is four years after the date the return is filed in Arizona. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1104; Ariz. Admin. Code 15-5-2222. The books, records and accounts must be open for inspection at any reasonable time by the department or its authorized agent. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1105(D); Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax Decision No. 14C-201400004S-REV (holding that taxpayer not maintaining proper records could be taxed based on bank deposits). If a taxpayer is engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property at both wholesale and retail, the taxpayer must maintain the books to separately show the gross proceeds of sales of each class to only have the tax apply to the gross proceeds of the sales made at retail. However, if books are not kept in such a manner, the tax is imposed on the gross proceeds of every sale made. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5061(G), as renumbered by 2015 Ariz. S.B. 1216, effective April 9, 2015. A taxpayer with multiple licenses for separate businesses is required to maintain separate records for each licensed business. Each business classification is independent of the other classifications even when transacted under one license. A person who engages in more than one type of business under one license is required to maintain books and records so that the gross proceeds of sales or gross income of each taxable business classification is shown separately. Failure to maintain books and records results in the imposition of tax at the highest tax rate on gross proceeds of sales or gross income applicable to a classification under which the taxpayer is doing business. Ariz. Admin. Code 15-5-2004. A retailer selling food must maintain accurate, verifiable and complete records of all purchases and sales of tangible personal property in order to verify transaction privilege tax exemptions. Any method of recording may be used by a retailer as long as it properly reflects all purchases and sales of food items exempted from taxes, as well as all purchases and sales of items subject to taxes. Any retailer who fails to maintain adequate records must pay the amount of taxes that would have been imposed if the sales of food had not been exempted. If the retailer cannot demonstrate to the department that its records properly reflect all sales of food items exempted from tax, the department may recompute the amount of tax to be paid. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5104(A)-(C). Special Event Operators An operator of a special event is required to maintain a current list of vendors conducting business on the premises as sellers, providing each vendor's name, business name, and business address. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1105(G); Arizona Information Publication 550. On written notice from the Arizona Department of Revenue, the operator must submit a copy of the list. This requirement applies to an operator of a swap meet, flea market, fair, carnival, festival, circus or other transient selling event. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1105(G); Arizona Information Publication 550. Additionally, the operator should inform the department if the sales are conducted through a central cash register. Arizona Information Publication 550. BNA-SUTN AZ 31.9.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Refunds

Vendor If the Department of Revenue determines that any amount of tax, penalty, or interest has been overpaid, the department will credit the excess amount against any tax administered pursuant to the general administrative provisions of Title 42, Taxation, including any penalty, interest or other amounts owed by the taxpayer to the department. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1118(A). In the event that the amount cannot be credited against a tax or installment tax liability, the department may:• refund the entire overpayment in a lump sum or in not more than five annual installments; • issue the taxpayer a credit voucher for the amount to be carried forward and applied against future tax liabilities; or • refund part of the overpayment, and issue a credit voucher for the balance of overpayment. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1118(A). Refunds are issued to the taxpayer from whom the tax was collected. For purposes of transaction privilege tax on retail sales, the refund will generally be made to the retailer. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1118(A)(1). The department gives a vendor who has a duty to collect use tax and who has not collected that tax, full credit or offset for any use tax, interest and penalty paid to the department by the purchaser when issuing a determination of a deficiency pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1108. This credit or offset will be computed from the date of the use tax payment by the purchaser. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1118(D). A claim for a refund must be filed with the department in writing and state the taxpayer's name, address, and tax identification number. The claim must identify the amount of the refund requested, the tax period involved, and the basis for the claim. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1118(E). A claim for credit or refund may be allowed if filed within four years after the report or tax return is filed. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1106(A); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1104(A). The failure to begin an action for refund or credit within the statute of limitations will bar the taxpayer from recovering any excess taxes paid to the Department of Revenue. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1106(D). If a taxpayer pays the tax protested or appealed, the Department of Revenue, Board, or Court will treat the protest or the appeal as a claim for refund or an appeal from the denial of a claim for refund. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1118(I). BNA-SUTN AZ 31.10.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Statute of Limitations Refund Requests

4 Years Taxpayers must generally file claims for refunds or credits within four years from the date the report or return was required to be filed or was filed, whichever expires later. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1106. However, if the credit or refund claim is based on an account that has turned into bad debt, the statute of limitations is seven years from the date for filing the return. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1104(B)(4). BNA-SUTN AZ 31.11.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Statute of Limitations Assessment of Additional Tax

4 Years State law requires the Department of Revenue generally to mail notices of deficiency assessments within four years from the date the report or return was required to be filed or was filed, whichever expires later. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1104(A). If a taxpayer omits at least 25 percent of gross income or gross receipts from the amount stated in the return, the tax can be assessed at any time within six years after the return was filed. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1104(B)(2). The department may assess tax or begin a court proceeding for the collection of tax at any time when the taxpayer has either filed a false or fraudulent return with the intent to evade tax, or failed to file a return. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1104(B)(1), as amended by 2019 Ariz. H.B. 2042, effective July 27, 2019, for assessments issued beginning on or after Aug. 1, 2019. Before the statute of limitations expires, a taxpayer can consent in writing to extend the assessment period by an agreed upon amount of time. An assessment may be made at any time before the expiration of the agreed upon period. The period agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements made before the expiration of the previously agreed upon time period. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1104(B)(9). Local taxing jurisdictions are also subject to the procedure and enforcement rules unless otherwise provided by state or town ordinance. Therefore the same statute of limitations period applies to the local transaction privilege taxes. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1104(B)(1). BNA-SUTN AZ 31.11.2.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Civil Penalties

Yes In Arizona, the Department of Revenue imposes a penalty if a taxpayer fails to file a return unless it is shown that the failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. The penalty imposed is equal to 4.5 percent of the tax required per month, but will not exceed 25 percent. Other penalties may also apply. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1125(A), as amended by 2019 Ariz. H.B. 2373, effective Aug. 26, 2019. If a taxpayer fails to file a return on notice and demand by the Department of Revenue, then the taxpayer must pay a penalty of 25 percent of the tax, plus any additional penalties. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1125(B). If a taxpayer fails or refuses to furnish information that the Department of Revenue has requested in writing, then Arizona may add a 25 percent penalty to the assessed deficiency. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1125(C). If a person fails to pay the amount of tax shown on any return within the time prescribed, a penalty is imposed of 0.5 percent, not to exceed a total of 10 percent, to the tax due for each month or fraction of a month during which the failure continues. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1125(D). If a person fails to pay tax on time or within 21 calendar days after the date of notice and demand, then Arizona adds a penalty of 0.5 percent per delinquent month (but not exceeding 10 percent). Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1125(E). If a deficiency is due to negligence without intent to defraud, then the person must pay a 10 percent penalty of the deficiency amount. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1125(F). If part of a deficiency is due to fraud with intent to evade tax, then Arizona imposes a penalty of 50 percent of the total amount of tax, in addition to the deficiency, interest, and other penalties. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1125(G). A taxpayer required to file electronically and that fails to do so is subject to a penalty of 5 percent of the tax required to be shown on the return or $25, whichever is greater, unless the failure is due to a reasonable cause and not due to wilful neglect. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1125(X)(2), as amended by 2018 Ariz. S.B. 1293, effective Jan. 1, 2019, and by 2019 Ariz. H.B. 2373, effective Aug. 26, 2019; Arizona Dept. of Rev., News & Announcements (Nov. 29, 2018); Arizona Publication No. 650. Civil Penalties for Return Preparers, Electronic Filing and Payment Participants A return preparer or electronic return preparer must pay a $50 penalty if the preparer fails to:• furnish a completed return, statement or other document to the taxpayer for his or her signature; • sign any return, statement or document; • furnish the preparer's identifying number on any return, statement or other document; • retain a copy of any return, statement or other document for six years for transaction privilege tax returns and use tax returns; or • comply with any electronic filing program requirement. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1125.01(A)-(D),(F). If a return preparer or electronic return preparer fraudulently endorses or negotiates any check issued to a taxpayer, the return preparer or electronic preparer must pay a fine of $500. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1125.01(E). BNA-SUTN AZ 31.12.1.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Criminal Penalties

Yes Arizona may impose criminal penalties for violations of the rules and regulations of the transaction privilege tax and use tax. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1127. It is a class 5 felony in Arizona to:• knowingly fail to pay transaction privilege taxes or use taxes administered under the transaction privilege tax or use tax statues or believed to be due by the taxpayer with the intention to evade the tax; • knowingly prepare, present, aid, procure or advise in preparing or presenting any return, affidavit, claim or other document which is fraudulent or false as to any material matter, regardless of whether the falsity or fraud is done with the knowledge or consent of the taxpayer; • simulate or falsely or fraudulently execute or sign any license or other required document, or cause the license or document to be fraudulently or falsely executed, or to advise or aid in such an execution with the intent to conceal or cover up a material fact relating to the administration of the transaction privilege tax or use tax; or • knowingly fail to file or return or knowingly fail to supply required information, or falsify or conceal a material fact, document or record, or make a false, fictitious statement or representation or make or use a false writing or document knowing it to contain a false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, with the intent that the Department of Revenue rely on the false, fictitious or fraudulent information in determining transaction privilege tax or use tax. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1127(B). However, effective July 7, 2017, a first time violation may be deemed a class 1 misdemeanor. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1127(B), as amended by 2017 Ariz. H.B. 2280, effective July 7, 2017(90 days after close of 2017 Legislative Session). Effective April 11, 2018, it is a class 5 felony, but may be a class 1 misdemeanor for a first-time violation, in Arizona to purchase, install, or use any automated sales suppression device or service or zapper or phantom-ware with the intent to defeat or evade a tax. A person who violates this provision is subject to a fine of not more than $100,000 or, if the violator is a corporation, not more than $500,000. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1127(B)(5), as added by 2018 Ariz. S.B. 1386, effective April 11, 2018. The presumptive sentence for a class 5 felony in Arizona is 1.5 years imprisonment. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §13-702(D). BNA-SUTN AZ 31.12.2.

==================================================

Topic: Administration and Procedure Penalties Waiver of Penalties

Yes Arizona statutes provide that the department may abate penalties for reasonable cause. A taxpayer can establish reasonable cause by providing facts and circumstances that show it exercised ordinary business care and prudence when it filed and paid the tax, that the condition that created the assessment is not a recurring problem with that taxpayer, and that specific reasons exist that explain why the taxpayer did not file and pay the return in a timely manner. There is no statutory provision for interest abatement based on reasonable cause. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-2062; Arizona Publication No. 700 (rev. June 2015); Arizona General Tax Ruling 04-2 (Oct. 14, 2004). Further, the department may abate the penalties imposed on an amount assessed as a deficiency if:• the deficiency assessed is directly attributable to erroneous written advice furnished to the taxpayer by a department employee acting in an official capacity in response to a specific request from the taxpayer and not from the taxpayer's failure to provide adequate or accurate information; or • the three following elements are all true: o a department-prepared tax return form or tax ruling contains a statement that, if followed by a taxpayer, would cause the taxpayer to misapply the law; o the taxpayer reasonably relied on the statement; and o the taxpayer's underpayment directly resulted from that reliance. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-2052(A). Arizona has waived penalties imposed against property management companies that were required to electronically file and remit city privilege taxes using a consolidated return starting on Jan. 1, 2018. Property management companies complained of technical difficulty using the system and experienced excessive delays in trying to so file. The Arizona Department of Revenue determined that the difficulties experienced by the property management companies constituted a reasonable basis for their failure to register, electronically file and pay.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Audits

Authorized In Arizona, the department may examine any return, or any books, papers, records, or memoranda relating to the return, within the applicable statute of limitations if a taxpayer fails to file a return or the department is not satisfied with the return or the payment of tax. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1108(A), as amended by 2019 Ariz. H.B. 2373, effective Aug. 26, 2019. The audit can be either done through a detailed review of transactions or records or by a statistically valid sampling method. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1108(A), as amended by 2019 Ariz. H.B. 2373, effective Aug. 26, 2019. Single source audits have been implemented. This allows an audit to be conducted by state-trained staff and will include any cities where a taxpayer conducts business. Arizona Dept. of Rev., Transaction Privilege Tax Changes & News (Oct. 21, 2014). The burden to prove that the sale of tangible personal property is not a sale at retail is on the taxpayer who made it, unless the taxpayer has taken a certificate of exemption from the purchaser. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5022. Once the Department of Revenue completes an audit and a deficiency has been completely determined, the taxpayer's liability for the transaction privilege tax for the period subject to the audit is fixed and determined. No additional audit may be conducted except in the following circumstances:• if a taxpayer files a claim for refund under Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1251(B) or any other provision authorizing a claim for refund; • if a taxpayer submits changes or correction reports; • if the taxpayer failed to disclose material information during the audit, or falsified books or records, or prevented the department from conducting an accurate audit; or • in the case of audits conducted under a limited managed audit agreement, the department may audit the issues not covered by the agreement, if within the statute of limitations. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-2059(A). If the department issues a notice of proposed assessment of transaction privilege or use tax, the department may not increase the amount of the proposed assessment except in one of the following situations:• the taxpayer made a material misrepresentation of facts; • the taxpayer failed to disclose a material fact to the auditor; • the Department of Revenue requested information and the taxpayer failed to provide that information; or • after issuing the notice of proposed assessment, but before the assessment becomes final, the tax court, court of appeals, or Supreme Court issues a decision that causes the initial tax assessment to increase. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-2059(B). Any additional tax liability due as a result of an audit of the taxpayer's transaction privilege tax must be paid within 30 days after receipt of the assessment. In the event an appeal is taken to the department, payment must be made within 10 days after the order or decision becomes final. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-5021. A taxpayer has 45 days after an assessment to appeal the Department of Revenue's assessment; otherwise, the right to appeal is waived. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1251(A), (B), as amended by 2017 Ariz. H.B. 2280, effective July 7, 2017, and by 2019 Ariz. H.B. 2373, effective Aug. 26, 2019. Managed Audit A taxpayer may apply to the Department of Revenue's director for a managed audit. A managed audit agreement means a written agreement between the director and taxpayer that consists of an audit plan that requires the taxpayer to review selected revenue, expense and fact records to determine the proper filing method and to calculate the taxpayer's liability under the transaction privilege tax. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-2301. The director may consider all relevant factors when determining whether to agree to a managed audit agreement, including:• the taxpayer's history of tax compliance; • the amount of the taxpayer's time and quality of resources that the taxpayer can dedicate to the audit; • the extent and availability of the taxpayer's records; and • the nature and scope of any legal dispute with the department and its relevance to the managed audit proposal. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-2302(C). A managed audit agreement includes county excise taxes. A taxpayer may request that the managed audit agreement include city and town excise taxes. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-2302(D). After the taxpayer provides its managed audit finding to the director, the director may accept or reject the findings and issue a notice of determination. If the managed audit results in a determination that the taxpayer disputes or if the director rejects the findings of the managed audit, the taxpayer may appeal the notice of determination. The taxpayer has the same appeal rights as if the department conducted the audit. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-2303. After the department completes an audit or the findings of a managed audit are accepted, no additional audit may be conducted, unless one of the following occurs:• the taxpayer files a claim for refund under Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1251(B) or any other provision authorizing a claim for refund; • a city or town requests an audit and only an audit of state transaction privilege or use tax has previously been completed for the period; • there are changes or corrections required to be submitted to the department under Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §43-327; • the taxpayer failed to disclose material information during the audit, or has falsified books or records or otherwise prevented the department from conducting an accurate audit; or • there are additional issues that were not covered by a limited managed audit agreement. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-2059(A). BNA-SUTN AZ 31.16.

Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1251(B), as amended by 2018 Ariz. S.B. 1385, effective retroactively to Dec. 31, 2016, and by 2017 Ariz. H.B. 2280, effective July 7, 2017, and by 2019 Ariz.

Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1251(C), as amended by 2018 Ariz. S.B. 1385, effective retroactively to Dec. 31, 2016, and by 2019 Ariz. H.B. 2373, effective Aug. 26, 2019. If the petition for an appeal is not made within 45 days of receiving the notice, the amount determined to be due becomes final and the taxpayer is deemed to have waived all rights to question the amount determined to be due, unless the total amount of the assessment, including interest and penalties, is paid. If the assessment is paid in full, the taxpayer may file a claim for refund within six months of payment. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1251(D), as amended by 2019 Ariz.

A taxpayer may appeal a decision from the department to the State Board of Tax Appeals by filing a notice of appeal in writing within 30 days of the decision or order from the department becoming final. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1253. A taxpayer may also appeal a decision of the department to tax court rather than to the State Board of Tax Appeals by filing a notice of appeal in writing within 30 days of the decision or order from the department becoming final. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1254(C). The department may appeal a decision of the State Board of Tax Appeals to tax court if the amount in dispute is more than $5,000. If the amount in dispute is less that $5,000, the matter can only be appealed to tax court if the decision involves an issue of substantial significance to the state. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1254(B). The burden of proof in an appeal of an assessment of transaction privilege tax or use tax lies with the department to prove by a preponderance of the evidence any factual issue that is relevant to ascertaining the tax liability of the taxpayer, provided that:• the taxpayer has asserted a reasonable dispute regarding the issue; • the taxpayer has fully cooperated with the department regarding the issue and has provided, within a reasonable period of time, access to and inspection of all witnesses, information and documents under the taxpayer's control, as reasonably requested; and • the taxpayer has kept and maintained records as required by the transaction privilege tax statute or the use tax statute. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §42-1255. BNA-SUTN AZ 31.17.
