Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

True Object Test A mixed transaction is a transaction in which the consumer receives both taxable and nontaxable tangible personal property and services in any combination. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.012(A)(1). Ohio uses the “true object test” to determine whether two kinds of mixed transactions other than bundled transactions are taxable. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.012(B); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.012(D); Accountant's Computer Services Inc. v. Kosydar, 298 N.E.2d 519 (Ohio 1973); Emery Industries v. Limbach, 539 N.E.2d 608 (Ohio 1989). The first is a retail sale of tangible personal property and a service, the property is essential to the use of the service, and the true object of the transaction is the service. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.012(B)(1). The second is a retail sale of two or more services involving no property, the first service is provided exclusively in connection with the second service, and the true object is the second service. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.012(B)(2). The true object test in both these retail sales is applied on a case-by-case basis to each transaction's particular facts. Two of the factors considered in determining the true object are the seller's business and the purchaser's object in engaging in the transaction. If the true object is the taxable tangible personal property or a taxable service, then the entire transaction is taxable. On the other hand, if the true object is the nontaxable tangible personal property or service, then the entire transaction is nontaxable. Ohio Information Release ST 2010-02. The true object test was first adopted in 1973 when the Ohio Supreme Court decided that the conversion of raw accounting data supplied by the customer into “print-outs,” was the “true object” of the transaction because the property produced, rather than the service, was the object sought by the purchaser. Accountant's Computer Services Inc. v. Kosydar, 298 N.E.2d 519 (Ohio 1973). Fifteen years later, the Ohio Supreme Court sought to clarify the true object test in Emery Industries v. Limbach. The Court defined a personal service as “any intellectual or manual act involving a recognized skill performed by a person who is specifically engaged by the purchaser to perform the act.” This definition emphasizes that a purchaser selects a service provider because the provider has a recognized skill. To determine whether a mixed transaction is taxable, the overriding purpose of the purchaser must be determined. If the purchaser seeks the tangible personal property produced by the service, then the transfer of the property is a consequential element of the transaction, and the entire transaction is considered a taxable transaction. If the purchaser's overriding purpose is the nontaxable service provided by the service provider, any transfer of tangible personal property is inconsequential to the transaction, and the transaction as a whole is not taxable. Emery Industries v. Limbach, 539 N.E.2d 608 (Ohio 1989). Other rules apply to other kinds of mixed transactions. Ohio employs the de minimis rule when transactions include both taxable and nontaxable products. If the purchase price of the taxable products is de minimis, then the entire transaction is nontaxable. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.012(B)(3); Ohio Information Release ST 2010-02. Ohio uses a bright line 50 percent rule (or a “primary test”) if a retail sale comprises multiple products that are all tangible personal property and one or more of the products are food, food ingredients, soft drinks, candy or dietary supplements, drugs including over-the-counter and grooming and hygiene products, durable medical equipment, mobility enhancing equipment, prosthetic devices, or medical supplies. When the taxable products are not the primary products, i.e., less than 50 percent of the total sales price, then the transaction is not a “bundled transaction”and is nontaxable. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.012(B)(4); Ohio Information Release ST 2010-02. The true object test applies when determining the taxability of retail sales of automatic data processing, computer services, or electronic information services. These services are taxable when the true object of the transaction is the receipt by the consumer of the services rather than the receipt of personal or professional services to which automatic data processing, computer services, or electronic information services are incidental or supplemental. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.012(B)(3)(e); Ohio Admin. Code §5703-9-46(B)(1); Ohio Information Release ST 1999-04. When a transaction includes automatic data processing, computer services, or electronic information services, the true object of the transaction is the receipt of the services if they render a significant benefit to the consumer. Ohio Admin. Code §5703-9-46(B)(3)(a). Alternatively, the true object of a transaction is the personal or professional services if:• the provider merely uses the automatic data processing, computer services, or electronic information services in performing or delivering the personal or professional service; • the benefit the consumer seeks is the personal or professional service;or • the automatic data processing, computer services, or electronic information services themselves do not benefit the consumer significantly. Ohio Admin. Code §5703-9-46(B)(3)(b). Automatic data processing, computer services, or electronic information services may also be part of a mixed transaction. Such transactions include separable components, one of which is one or more of these services, and the other is personal or professional services, or consequential tangible personal property, or other taxable services. The true object of this transaction might be each of the components. In this instance, the contract or initial billing must separate each component and its price. Tax applies only to the taxable components. Ohio Admin. Code §5703-9-46(B)(4); see also Ohio Information Release ST 1999-04 (addressing mixed transactions involving nontaxable digital advertising services and taxable electronic information services).

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Bundled Transactions

Yes A bundled transaction is a retail sale involving two or more products sold for one non-itemized price. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.012(A)(1). Outside of the bundled transaction the products are otherwise distinct and identifiable. Bundled transactions do not include the sale of any products if the price is variable, with the price being determined based on selections of products made by the consumer. Likewise, bundled transactions cannot involve real property or services to real property. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.012(A)(1). A transaction otherwise satisfying the definition of a bundled transaction will not be considered a bundled transaction if it is any of the following:• a retail sale of tangible personal property and a service when the tangible personal property is essential to the use of the service, and the tangible personal property is provided exclusively in connection with the service, so long as the true object of the transaction is the service; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.012(B)(1). • a retail sale of services when one service is provided that is essential to the use or receipt of a second service, the first service is provided exclusively in connection with the second service, and the true object of the transaction is the second service; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.012(B)(2). • a transaction that includes taxable products and nontaxable products, and the purchase price or sales price of the taxable products is 10 percent or less of the total price of the bundled products; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.012(B)(3). or • a retail sale of exempt tangible personal property and taxable tangible personal property when the transaction includes food and food ingredients, drugs, durable medical equipment, mobility enhancing equipment, over-the-counter drugs, prosthetic devices, or medical supplies, and the vendor's or seller's purchase price or sales price of the taxable tangible personal property is fifty per cent or less of the total purchase price or sales price of the bundled tangible personal property. Vendors and sellers may not use a combination of the purchase price and sales price of the tangible personal property when making the 50 percent determination for a transaction. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.012(B)(4). Telecommunications Bundled Transactions When a bundled transaction involves telecommunication services, ancillary services, Internet access, or audio or video programming service:• if the total charge is for products that are taxable and products that are nontaxable, the part of the charge attributable to the nontaxable products is included in the tax base, and therefore taxable, unless the service provider can identify the portion of the charge not subject to taxation from its books and records that it keeps in the regular course of business. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.012(C)(1). • if the total charge is for products that are subject to tax at different tax rates, the total charge is treated as attributable to the products subject to tax at the highest tax rate unless the provider can identify the portion of the price attributable to the products subject to tax at the lower rate from its books and records. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.012(C)(2). If a bundled transaction does not fall into one of the categories discussed above, the taxability is determined by using the true object test. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.012(D). BNA-SUTN OH 9.3.2.

Purchases of watercraft and outboard motors subject to the state sales tax are exempt from both county sales taxes and the general purpose county use tax. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.021(A); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.026(A); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.021(A)(1); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.023(A)(1). However, purchases of watercraft and outboard motors are subject to the additional specific purpose county use tax in the county in which they are required to be registered. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.023(A)(1). Motor vehicles sales are exempt from both county sales taxes, but are subject to the county general use tax in the county in which the vehicle is required to be titled.

Additionally, the sale or use of the tangible personal property or enumerated services must occur within the county imposing these local taxes to be subject to tax. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.021(A)(2); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.026(A)(2). These taxable transactions are sourced to the localities using the same sourcing method used to source the state sales and use tax. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.021(A); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.026(A); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.021(A)(2); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.023(A)(2). All applicable exemptions available at the state level are also available at the local level. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.021(A); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.026(A); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.021(A)(1); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.021(D); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.023(A)(1); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.023(D). Transit Authority Tax Additionally, Ohio permits any transit authority to levy a sales tax upon retail sales made and a use tax on any use, consumption, or storage of tangible personal property within the territory of the transit authority. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.023(A); Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5741.022(A). The rate of the tax must be the same for both the sales and use taxes and may be imposed up to 1.5 percent in 0.1 or 0.25 percent increments. Effective Oct. 1, 2019, the tax may be imposed in increments of 0.05 percent and shall not exceed 1.5 percent minus the amount levied under the county sales tax. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.023(A), as amended by 2017 Ohio H.B. 69, effective March 23, 2018, and by 2019 Ohio H.B. 166, effective Oct. 1, 2019. BNA-SUTN OH 9.4.
