Taxable Massachusetts imposes a sales tax on tangible personal property, with exemptions for specific items such as clothing and food. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 64H, §2. Absent the sales tax, use tax applies to the storage, use, or other consumption in Massachusetts of tangible personal property unless specifically exempt. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 64I, §2; Mass. Gen. L. ch. 64I, §7(a); Mass. Gen. L. ch. 64I, §7. Massachusetts applies a partial exemption to the sale of clothing. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 64H, §6(k); Mass. Gen. L. ch. 64I, §7(b). Any individual clothing item costing more than $175 is taxable on the amount over $175. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 64H, §6(k); Mass. Gen. L. ch. 64I, §7(b); see Sales and Use Navigator, at Massachusetts Section 10.1.1. BNA-SUTN MA 9.1.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Taxation of Services

Enumerated Services Only The sales tax applies only to specifically enumerated services, which include telecommunication services, information services, and fabrication services. Mass. Gen. L. ch. 64H, §2. Other services, however, are taxable if specifically included in the definition of “sale.” Where telecommunications services are purchased in conjunction with other services, the entire sales price is taxable as a sale or use of telecommunications services, unless the sales price of the telecommunications portion of the services is separately stated from the sales price of the other services being provided on the invoice or other evidence of the sale. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.1.6(7)(a). If the two amounts are separately stated, the tax is assessed only on the sales price of the taxable telecommunications services, provided that such separately stated charges are:• determined in a manner that reasonably reflects the value of the telecommunications services in relation to the other services; • set in good faith; and • supported by records sufficient to document the charges. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.1.6(7)(a). If all of these conditions are not met, then the entire transaction is taxable. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.1.6(7)(a). BNA-SUTN MA 9.2.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Mixed Transactions and the True Object Test

Depends Services performed in conjunction with the sale of tangible personal property may be subject to tax. The commonwealth utilizes a version of the true object test. The basic distinction in determining whether a particular transaction involves a sale of tangible personal property or the transfer of tangible personal property incidental to the performance of a service is one of the true objects of the contract; that is, is the real object sought by the buyer the service per se or the property produced by the service. If the true object of the contract is the service per se, the transaction is not subject to tax even though some tangible personal property is transferred. Houghton Mifflin Co. v. State Tax Comm., 373 Mass. 772 (Mass. 1977). A Massachusetts regulation excludes separately stated charges for services from the sales tax in transactions involving the sale of tangible personal property under the following guidelines. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, § 64H.1.1(2)(b)1 and 2. A service transaction is not subject to the sales tax where:• the real object of the transaction is the service itself, and no transfer of tangible personal property occurs; Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.1.1(2)(a)(1). or • the real object of the transaction is the service itself, and an inconsequential transfer of tangible personal property occurs, and the service enterprise does not separately state the purchase price of the property on the bill to the customer. In this case the service enterprise pays the sales tax when the enterprise purchases the property from a vendor. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.1.1(2)(a)(2). A service transaction is subject to the sales tax where:• the transfer of tangible personal property occurs, and the charge for the property is stated separately from the charge for labor on the bill to the customer, whether or not the value of the property is inconsequential; Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.1.1(2)(b)(1). or • the transfer of tangible personal property occurs, and the value of the property is more than inconsequential in relation to the total charge, and the charge for the property is not separately stated on the bill to the customer. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.1.1(2)(b)(2). The term “inconsequential” means a value of less than 10 percent of the total charge, and the term “not inconsequential” means a value of greater than 10 percent of the total charge. This definition serves only as a guideline, and varies depending on the facts and circumstances of the transaction. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.1.1(1). Software and Associated Services In applying the commonwealth's version of the true object test, when the provision of services is bundled with a software lease/subscription, the weight of the taxable transaction represented by the subscription can overcome substantial attendant service offerings. In Massachusetts Letter Ruling 13-2, the commonwealth ruled that even round-the-clock, nontaxable information filtering services, when bundled with a taxable lease of software that provides analysis of the filtered information, is a taxable bundle. Massachusetts Letter Ruling 13-2 (March 11, 2013). BNA-SUTN MA 9.3.1.

Topic: Overview: Taxation of Property and Services Mixed and Bundled Transactions, Application of the True Object Test Bundled Transactions

Depends If, in addition to rendering a service, a service enterprise sells tangible personal property in the regular course of business, it is a retailer with respect to such sales and will collect the sales tax from the customer. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.1.1(4). A service enterprise may give a resale certificate to its vendor when the service enterprise purchases property that it intends to resell, or when it is unable to ascertain at the time of purchase whether it will sell the property separately or use it in a service transaction. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.1.1(4). If a service enterprise gives to a vendor a resale certificate for tangible personal property, subsequently uses the property in a service transaction or under a service contract, and does not state separately to its customer the charge for the property, the service enterprise will pay to the Commissioner a sales or use tax based upon the cost of the property to the service enterprise. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.1.1(4). If a service enterprise pays the sales tax upon the purchase of the property and subsequently resells the property in the regular course of business, the service enterprise will collect the tax from the customer. The service enterprise may then supply its vendor with a resale certificate and request that the vendor refund the sales tax paid on that property. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 830, §64H.1.1(4). BNA-SUTN MA 9.3.2.
