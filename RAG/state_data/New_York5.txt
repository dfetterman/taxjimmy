Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Real Property

Nontaxable New York does not impose sales tax on sales of real property. See N.Y. Tax Law §1105; see also New York Publication 862 (outlining when tangible personal property becomes a capital improvement and is therefore considered to become a component part of real property). Real property includes land, including trees and mines and quarries therein; buildings and structures; railroad structures and tracks; telephone lines, wires and poles, boilers, heating systems and plumbing. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.7(a)(2). BNA-SUTN NY 28.1.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal Sale and Installation of Appliances, Electronics, Machinery, and Equipment

Depends New York does not treat the sale and installation of appliances, electronics, machinery, and equipment per se as a taxable sale and installation of tangible personal property. See N.Y. Tax Law §1101 - N.Y. Tax Law §1150. Instead, the characterization of the sale and installation of these items is determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, applying New York's three-part test. See N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.7(a)(3). However, the sale and installation of free-standing appliances is treated per se as a taxable sale and installation of tangible personal property. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §541.5(d)(1)(ii)(c). BNA-SUTN NY 28.2.2.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal Sale and Installation of Flooring and Window Treatments

Depends The sale and installation of flooring and window treatments is subject to New York's sales and use tax unless it constitutes a nontaxable capital improvement. New York Publication 862. For instance, the installation of carpet, carpet tile, carpet padding, linoleum and vinyl roll floor covering, linoleum tile, vinyl tile, and other similar floor covering, as an initial finished floor covering is a nontaxable capital improvement. However, if such installation is performed in a building more than six months after the building has otherwise been completed, this constitutes taxable repair, maintenance, or installation. New York Publication 862. BNA-SUTN NY 28.2.4.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal Character of Leasehold Improvements

Depends As a general rule, additions or alterations to real property for or by a tenant with respect to leased premises are presumed to be temporary in nature and, consequently, do not qualify as capital improvements. New York TB-ST-113 (Aug. 7, 2014). However, an alteration or addition to leased property may qualify as a capital improvement if there is an intention to make it permanent and it also meets the other two criteria for a capital improvement described above. For example, an intention of permanence would be demonstrated by a provision in the building lease indicating that immediately upon installation, title to the installation vests with the lessor, and the installed property is to remain with the premises after the termination of the lease. New York TB-ST-113 (Aug. 7, 2014). BNA-SUTN NY 28.2.6.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Construction Materials and Contracts Construction Materials and Contracts, Generally

Depends The imposition of tax on services and materials performed on real property depends on the end result of such service. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.7(b)(4). If the end result of the services is the repair or maintenance of real property, such services are taxable. If the end result of the same service is a capital improvement to the real property, such services are not taxable. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.7(b)(4). New York does not impose sales tax on tangible personal property sold by a contractor to a person for whom the contractor is adding to or improving real property by a capital improvement, if the property sold becomes an integral component of the real property. N.Y. Tax Law §1115(a)(17); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §528.18; see also New York TSB-A-15(48)S (Nov. 20, 2015). However, if a contractor performs repair, maintenance, or installation service on real property, then the work is not a capital improvement, and the contractor must collect sales tax from the customer unless the customer provides a properly completed exemption document (e.g., Form ST-119.1, Exempt Organization Certification). New York Publication 862. Tax Treatment of Capital Improvements New York does not impose sales tax on tangible personal property sold by a contractor to a person for whom the contractor is adding to or improving real property by a capital improvement, if the property sold becomes an integral component of the real property. N.Y. Tax Law §1115(a)(17); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §528.18; see also New York TSB-A-15(48)S (Nov. 20, 2015). A capital improvement is an addition or alteration to real property which substantially adds to the value of the real property or appreciably prolongs the useful life of the real property and which becomes a part of the real property or is permanently affixed to the real property so that removal would cause material damage to the property and is intended to become a permanent installation. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.7(a)(3); New York TSB-A-16(10)S (March 30, 2016) (product that is placed on floor, but not necessarily attached to wall, to organize closets does not constitute a capital improvement as removal of product would not cause material damage to real property or to the product itself); New York TSB-A-09(62)S (Dec. 29, 2009) (construction and installation of a commercial wind farm on land leased for 40 years was not considered a capital improvement to real property, but the assembly and installation of wind generation equipment used directly and predominantly in the generation of electricity for sale qualified for an exemption under N.Y. Tax Law §1115(a)(12). But see In re A. Colarusso & Son, Inc., New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 822704 (June 23, 2011) (truck scale anchored to real property was exempt as a capital improvement under N.Y. Tax Law §1105(c)(3)(iii)). As a general rule, a contractor is required to pay sales tax when purchasing tangible personal property from its suppliers. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §541.1(a)(2)(b); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §541.5(b). Similarly, in the case of capital improvements, property owners that purchase tangible personal property must pay tax to the supplier on the sale of such tangible personal property. In other words, the effect of this “capital improvement” exemption is to require the payment of sales tax on the materials used in the capital improvement, but the labor component of the project will not be subject to sales or use tax. This exemption applies regardless of whether the property owner itself purchases its own materials and supplies. Therefore, in the case of a capital improvement, if the property owner purchases its own materials and supplies and hires a contractor to perform the labor, then the property owner pays tax to the supplier on its purchase of the tangible personal property, but does not pay any tax to the contractor for the labor. In the case of a capital improvement where the property owner purchases the materials and supplies and labor from the contractor the property owner pays no tax. N.Y. Tax Law §1115(a)(17); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §528.18; see also New York TSB-A-15(48)S (Nov. 20, 2015). N.Y. Tax Law §1101(b)(9)(i) provides the definition of “capital improvement” and states that it is an addition to or alteration to real property, which satisfies the following three criteria:• it substantially adds to the value of the real property, or appreciably prolongs the useful life of the real property; • it becomes part of the real property or is permanently affixed to the real property so that removal would cause material damage to the property or article itself; and • it is intended to become a permanent installation. N.Y. Tax Law §1101(b)(9)(i). The installation of floor covering is subject to tax unless it is the installation of the initial finished floor cover in new construction, in a new addition to existing construction or in a total reconstruction of existing construction. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §541.14(b); New York TB-ST-113. “Agency contracts” in the context of contracts with customers other than exempt organizations have the opposite result from “agency contracts” between contractors and exempt organizations. If a non-exempt customer enters into an agency contract with a contractor, all purchases for such contract are taxable to the customer. Under the agency relationship, the sale of the tangible personal property is deemed to be a retail sale to the customer, and the customer is liable for the tax due on his purchases of the property. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §541.5(c)(3). To create an agency relationship three conditions must be satisfied:• purchases must be billed to the customer directly or to the contractor specifying that the contractor is acting as agent for the customer; • the customer must pay the vendor from a special fund that it creates for this purpose, or the contractor can pay the vendor specifying payment as agent of the customer from the customer's special fund; and • the property purchased as a general rule must be delivered to the job site, but in certain instances can be transferred to a different site so long as the ultimate delivery is to the job site and the invoice properly identifies the ultimate delivery site. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §541.5(c)(1). The key significance of the agency arrangement in the non-exempt customer context is the identification of the purchaser liable for sales or use tax, if not properly collected and remitted. In either case, the sale is taxable. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §541.5(c)(1). Tax Treatment of Repair, Maintenance, or Installation Services to Real Property Generally, New York imposes sales and use tax on a sale of tangible personal property to a contractor for erecting, adding to, or altering real property, regardless of whether the tangible personal property is to be resold before it is used or consumed. N.Y. Tax Law §1101(b)(4)(i)(B); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §52(b)(1). If a contractor performs repair, maintenance, or installation service on real property, then the work is not a capital improvement, and the contractor must collect sales tax from the customer unless the customer provides a properly completed exemption document(e.g., Form ST-119.1, Exempt Organization Certification). New York Publication 862. However, if a contractor performs a capital improvement for a customer and the customer provides the contractor with a properly completed Form ST-124, Certificate of Capital Improvement, then the contractor need not collect sales tax from the customer, and the contractor will pay sales tax on the purchased materials. New York Publication 862. Form ST-124 must be filled out completely and detailed documentation of the services rendered must be provided or the exemption for construction materials may be disallowed. See In re Sweet Constr. Corp., New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 825489 (June 4, 2015) (finding reported nontaxable sales of repair services were unsubstantiated as capital improvements and therefore properly taxable where petitioner's Form ST-124 Certificate of Capital Improvement lacked both detail as to the services rendered and a Certificate of Authority number); see also In re Nw. Sign Indus., Inc., New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 825245 (May 12, 2016) (finding that petitioner failed to demonstrate work was nontaxable capital improvements where petitioner's Form ST-124, Certificate of Capital Improvement lacked both detail as to the services provided and a Certificate of Authority number and where the petitioner failed to present other documentation that gave a detailed description of the work performed). Contractors are properly assessed use tax on construction materials that they purchase exempt from tax under New York's resale exemption when they install the materials as a capital improvement to real property rather than reselling the materials. In re Constabile, New York Division of Tax Appeals Determination No. 826105 (Jan. 14, 2016), aff'd, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 826105 (April 14, 2017). The New York Department of Taxation and Finance has issued options on the following construction-related issues:• JFK Airport Capital Improvements Construction; See New York TSB-A-01(24)S (Oct. 26, 2001). • construction of a steam pipeline; See New York TSB-A-09(7)S (Jan. 30, 2009). • building renovations; See New York TSB-H-80(173)S (Sept. 10, 2008). • air conditioning/heating systems installment and servicing; See New York TSB-A-89(47)S (Dec. 8, 1989); New York TSB-A-89(30)S (Aug. 21, 1989); New York TSB-A-81(65)S (Dec. 23, 1981). and • safety containment systems essential for capital improvement. In re L&L Painting Co., Inc., New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 822266 (June 2, 2011). Purchase of Construction Materials by Broker The sale of construction materials to a broker who is acting as an agent on behalf of a construction company is considered a taxable retail sale made by the vendor directly to the construction company. Sales tax is due on the initial purchase of the materials by the agent, but not on reimbursements made by the construction company to the agent. Any fee paid to the broker is not subject to tax as it is a fee for a nontaxable service. Where an agency relationship has not been established between the broker and the construction company, the broker is deemed to be purchasing the materials directly. The broker must pay sales tax at the time of purchase unless the broker provides the requisite resale exemption certificate. Then, the broker is considered to be purchasing the materials for resale to the construction company, and consequently must register for sales tax purposes and collect and remit sales tax. New York TSB-A-15(37)S (Nov. 13, 2015). Sales Tax Credits for Contractors and Construction Materials When materials are bought from a supplier and then transferred to a customer as a part of a taxable repair, maintenance or installation service, they are subject to sales tax at the time of purchase, but are eligible for a sales tax credit. Qualifying materials include:• plywood, drywall, shingles and 2x4s; • nails, screws, bolts and staples; • electrical materials; • plumbing materials;and • landscaping materials. New York TB-ST-130. Credits are not available for sales tax paid on materials, supplies and other items that are not transferred to a customer as part of the job, even if the cost is included in price charged to the customer. These materials include:• tools(e.g., hammers or paint brushes); • consumable supplies (sandpaper or garbage bags); • cell phones, pagers and other office supplies; • drop cloths; • uniforms, clothing and work boots; • rented equipment and tools; • gases used in plumbing, welding, or similar services; and • vehicles and fuel used in those vehicles. New York TB-ST-130. Tax credits are not available for sales tax paid for materials for capital improvements because contractors are the end-users of those materials and are liable for tax. However, if sales tax is charged to a customer for a capital improvement because a contractor did not receive a properly completed capital improvement exemption certificate, the contractor must pay that money to the Department of Taxation and Finance, but the contractor may apply for a refund or credit on its next sales tax return if that money has been refunded to the customer when it submitted a properly completed certificate to the contractor. New York TB-ST-130. Sales tax credits may also be available in the following situations:• when the sales tax has increased during an existing unit-price construction or lump-sum contract period with a customer; • when the contractor charges sales tax to a customer in error and refunds it to the customer; • a contractor overpays sales tax; or • a contractor paid sales tax by mistake. New York TB-ST-130. Exempt Services to Real Property Other services to real property that are exempt from sales tax include:• maintenance fees paid under a lease for repair and upkeep of real property; In order to be exempt, the fees must be incidental to the tenant's rental payment. See New York TSB-A-97(83)S (Jan. 1, 1998) (commercial tenant not liable for sales tax on payments for services that are incidental to lease, such as fees for the maintenance of common areas, landscaping around the leased building, and nontaxable rent–related services). and • services rendered by an individual who is directly hired by a homeowner and who is not in the regular trade or business of offering such services to the general public. N.Y. Tax Law § 1105(c)(3)(i); N.Y. Tax Law § 1105(c)(5). New York Publication 862 provides a comprehensive list of various activities with respect to real property and identifies the activities as either capital improvements or repair, maintenance, or installation services. Categories addressed include:• air cleaners; • air conditioners; • bathrooms; • brickwork; • central air conditioning; • chimneys; • decks; • doors; • driveways, parking lots, and walks; • electrical exterior fire, water, and wind damage; • fireplaces; • floor coverings; • floors and floorings; • garage doors; • heating, including: ○ electric heat; ○ electric boilers; ○ electric furnaces; ○ gas; ○ heat pumps; ○ hot water; ○ oil; ○ radiant heat; ○ solar heat; ○ steam heat; ○ warm air duct systems; and ○ wood-burning furnaces, boilers, or stoves; • hot water heaters; • humidifiers; • kitchens; • landscaping and yard care; • masonry; • miscellaneous work; • painting; • patios; • plumbing(including piping, sinks, toilets, tubs, and showers); • roofs and roofing materials; • septic systems; • stairs; • sump pumps; • swimming pools; • ventilation; • walls;and • windows. See New York Publication 862. Capital Improvements New York defines the term “capital improvement”as an addition or alteration to real property that:• substantially adds to the real property's value and appreciably prolongs its useful life; N.Y. Tax Law §1101(b)(9)(i)(A); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.7(a)(3)(a); see also New York TSB-A-15(24)S (May 29, 2015) (supply chain management services company performed a capital improvement by replacing electrical equipment in a facility's switchgear assemblies because the newly installed electrical equipment added value to the real property). • becomes part of the real property or is permanently affixed to the real property so that removal would cause material damage to the property or article itself; N.Y. Tax Law §1101(b)(9)(i)(B); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.7(a)(3)(b). and • is intended to become a permanent installation. N.Y. Tax Law §1101(b)(9)(i)(C); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.7(a)(3)(c). If temporary facilities are a necessary prerequisite to constructing a capital improvement to real property, then New York considers the temporary facilities to be a part of the capital improvement. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §541.8; see also In re L&L Painting Co., Inc., New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 822266 (June 2, 2011); New York TSB-A-13(11)S (April 11, 2013) (exempting a temporary pedestrian walkway erected as a necessary prerequisite to capital improvement). Scaffolding provided with services that are a necessary prerequisite to a capital improvement may be considered a tax-exempt temporary facility. Scaffolding that is rented or sold without the provision of any associated services is subject to tax as a sale or rental of tangible personal property regardless of whether it is sold or rented in connection with a capital improvement. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §541.8; New York TSB-A-16(11)S (April 22, 2016). A contractor that performs alterations and tenant fit-outs may have both taxable repairs and nontaxable capital improvements. For example, a contractor may alter a building and in the process repair the roof-top air conditioner to like new performance and repair the masonry work so that a new glass facade can be placed on the building. In this example, the air conditioner repair is not integral to the capital improvements, so the repair is subject to tax. On the other hand, the repair of the masonry is an integral part of attaching the new glass facade, which is a capital improvement. New York TSB-A-13(25)S (Sept. 9, 2013). Further, if repair, installation, or construction work is done as part of a contract with a tax-exempt organization or a local governmental entity, the contractor may be eligible to claim exemptions for its taxable services and purchases of materials for the contract. New York TSB-A-07(18)S (July 26, 2007) (nonprofit corporation's charges for maintenance and repair devices for low-income housing projects that were owned by separate for-profit entities were exempt from sales tax under N.Y. Tax Law § 1116(a)(4)). To qualify, the contractor should establish an agency relationship between itself and the organization or governmental entity. See N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, § 541.3(c)(4) (all purchases pursuant to contract with an exempt organization are exempt as long as property and services are purchased by contractor or subcontractor as agent for exempt organization); New York TSB-A-98(72)S (Oct. 15, 1998) (telecommunications company may claim exemptions for purchases of construction materials, installation services and lease payments under contract to build communications switching station when it acts as agent of county industrial development authority); New York TSB-A-99(33)S (June 24, 1999) (contractors providing services to nonprofit or governmental entities exempt from taxation not liable for collecting taxes on sales of tangible personal property).

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Services to Real Property Real Property Repair, Service

Taxable Generally, New York imposes sales tax on receipts from servicing, maintaining, or repairing real property, whether the services are performed in or outside of a building. N.Y. Tax Law §1105(c)(5); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.7(b)(1). New York regulations explain that “maintaining,” “servicing,” and “repairing”are terms used to cover all activities that relate to keeping real property fit, efficient, ready, or safe, or restoring the real property to that condition. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.7(a)(1). All receipts from the sale of repair and maintenance services, including management fees charged to provide those services, are subject to sales tax. See New York TSB-A-17(20)S (Aug. 4, 2017) (where company contracts repair and maintenance services for HVAC systems and uses service contractors to perform the services, a statement in the contract with the service providers that the company is acting as an agent for its customers is not sufficient to make the management fees tax exempt as part of a fiduciary relationship with the company's customers); New York TSB-A-14(17)S (company contracts repair and maintenance services for HVAC and refrigerator systems and uses service contractors to perform the services; the company charges a management fee as a part of its services). Real Property Testing and Monitoring Real property testing and monitoring services are taxable as services relating to maintaining, servicing or repairing real property, unless performed as part of a project to create a capital improvement on real property. See, e.g., New York TSB-A-15(42)S (Nov. 12, 2015) (asbestos testing services taxable as maintaining, servicing or repairing real property). Services Performed on a Building Additionally, services are also taxable when performed on a building itself. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.7(a)(1). These taxable services include:• painting; N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.7(a)(1). • services to the grounds(e.g., lawn services, tree removal, or spraying); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.7(a)(1). • trash and garbage removal; N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.7(a)(1); see also N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.7(b)(2) (trash and garbage removal services are taxable whether from inside or outside a building or vacant land). • sewerage service; N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.7(a)(1). But see New York TSB-A-11(2)S (Dec. 28, 2010) (provision of water is exempt when delivered through pipes or mains). and • snow removal. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.7(a)(1). Excluded Activities New York excludes by statute some activities as not being taxable real property service, maintenance, or repair work. N.Y. Tax Law §1105(c)(5); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.7(c). Those activities are:• services rendered by an individual who is not in a regular trade or business offering his services to the public; N.Y. Tax Law §1105(c)(5)(i); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.7(c)(1). • services rendered directly with respect to real property, property or land used or consumed directly and predominantly to produce gas or oil for sale by manufacturing, processing, generating, assembling, refining, mining, or extracting; N.Y. Tax Law §1105(c)(5)(ii). • services rendered with respect to real property, property or land used or consumed predominantly to produce tangible personal property for sale by farming, in a commercial horse boarding operation, or both; N.Y. Tax Law §1105(c)(5)(iii). and • qualified waste material removal services from a facility regulated as a transfer station or construction and demolition debris processing facility by the department of environmental conservation. N.Y. Tax Law §1105(c)(5)(iv); see also New York TSB-A-11(2)S (Dec. 28, 2010) (sewage service represents the maintenance of real property and is taxable as an enumerated service). To qualify, the waste material to be removed must not have been generated by the facility. Capital Improvements A primary concern is to distinguish taxable service, maintenance, and repair work from nontaxable capital improvements. See N.Y. Tax Law §1105(c)(5); N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.7(b)(4); New York Publication 862 (listing various activities and classifying them as either a capital improvement or a repair, maintenance, or installation service). A “capital improvement” is an addition or alteration to real property that: (1) substantially adds to the value of the real property, or appreciably prolongs the useful life of the real property; (2) becomes part of the real property or is permanently affixed to the real property so that removal would cause material damage to the property or article itself; and (3) is intended to become a permanent installation. N.Y. Tax Law § 1101(b)(9). Note that a construction contractor must pay sales tax on purchases of tangible personal property used in performing a capital improvement. See the discussion in 1840 T.M., State Taxation of Construction Contractors at 1840.02; New York TSB-A-97(67)S (Nov. 4, 1997) (charges for construction services to replace and install fireproofing, walls, and baseboards, and to paint offices were not subject to sales tax because they constituted capital improvements and removal would damage both real property and installed items); New York TSB-A-98(3)S (Feb. 2, 1998) (services performed by underwater consulting firm taxable if the project involves repair or maintenance of real property, but not taxable if services are capital improvements); New York TSB-A-98(76)S (Nov. 6, 1998) (installation of awning on home was capital improvement where materials were durable and subsequent removal would cause damage to roof); New York TSB-A-00(21)S (April 25, 2000) (charges for environmental cleanup services of landfill is not subject to tax because such services result in capital improvement); In re John Gallin & Son, Inc., New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 817990 (May 22, 2003) (renovated and reconstructed existing interior space, which included installation of floor covering, are not exempt capital improvements); New York TSB-A-02(60)S (Dec. 13, 2002) (removing construction debris from apartment units was nontaxable capital improvement); New York TSB-A-03(3)S (Jan. 27, 2003) (installation of flooring systems was nontaxable capital improvement); In re Supermarket Gen. Corp. Pathmark Stores, New York Tax Appeals Tribunal Decision No. 819768 (Nov. 9, 2006) (temperature control system that is essential component of refrigerated fixtures and culminates in addition to taxpayer's realty qualifies as capital improvement); New York TSB-A-06(9)S (March 8, 2006) (installation of kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities in existing buildings constituted capital improvements; installation of closet storage system considered capital improvement if removal would cause material damage to components and real property. Replacing some shingles or patching a roof is a repair, but installing a new asphalt shingle roof is a capital improvement. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §527.7(b)(4), Example 9. Generally, installing a built-in appliance (e.g., a built-in dishwasher, freezer, range, refrigerator, or oven) is a capital improvement, whereas installing a free-standing appliance is repair, maintenance, or installation of tangible personal property. New York Publication 862; see also New York TSB-A-15(18)S (May 12, 2015) (retail store that both sells and installs appliances need not collect sales tax on its appliance sales because it is performing capital improvements as a contractor; however, it must pay sales tax on its own purchase of the appliances).

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Contractor Classifications

Yes New York provides several classifications of contractors. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §541.2. In New York, “contractor”means a construction contractor, subcontractor, or repairman. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, §541.2(e). For statewide purposes, a “resident contractor” is means any contractor who has a place of business in New York or who is engaged in any manner in carrying on any employment, trade, business, or profession in New York, regardless of whether such business is incorporated within New York or in another state or whether the resident contractor may have a place of business or conduct any employment, trade, business, or profession outside New York state.
