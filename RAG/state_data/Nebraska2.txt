Topic: Administration and Procedure Vendor/Seller Registration

Required A retailer that is responsible for collecting and remitting sales tax must file an application for a sales tax permit with the Commissioner of the Nebraska Department of Revenue. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2705(1); Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-004.01. Retailers that are responsible for filing an application for a permit include retailers that are located in or maintain a place of business in Nebraska, and out-of-state retailers that make sales to a destination within Nebraska where the retailer engages in the regular and systematic soliciting of potential customers in Nebraska. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2705(1); Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-004.01. The permit must be conspicuously displayed at the place of business. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2705(5); Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-004.05. The sales tax permit is valid until cancelled or revoked, and is valid only for the person in whose name it was granted and for the transaction of business at the places designated on the permit. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2705(5). It is illegal for any person to transact business as a seller within Nebraska, unless a registration permit or permits have been issued. Sellers must file an application for a permit for each place of business and no fee will be levied for the application or issuance of the permit. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2705(3). Online Registration: As part of participation in the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, Nebraska will participate in an online registration system that allows retailers to register in all member states. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2705(10). Revocation of Vendor License: The Nebraska Tax Commissioner may suspend or revoke a retail sales permit for failure to comply with the Nebraska sales tax statutes or regulations, failure to provide any books, records, documents or items required by law, rule or regulation for inspection or misrepresenting, or failing to disclose, a material fact to the Department. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2705(6)(a); Nebraska Information Guide No. 4-787-1989. A hearing will be provided to the taxpayer before any suspension or revocation takes place. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2705(6)(a); Nebraska Information Guide No. 7-308-2018. The Nebraska Tax Commissioner must provide a 20-day notice to the taxpayer facing suspension or revocation of their retail sales permit. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2705(6)(a). The notice will specify the time and place for a hearing to take place and require the taxpayer to show cause why a permit should not be revoked or suspended. Notices may be served personally or by mail in the manner prescribed for service of notice of a deficiency determination. Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-004.07. Reissued Permits Following a Revocation: If the Commissioner has revoked a retailer's sales tax permit for whatever reason, the Commissioner may issue the taxpayer a new permit only if all tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, have been paid in full, and sufficient security has been posted with the Department to ensure future compliance. Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-004.07A. The amount of the security required before the Department will reissue a sales tax permit will not exceed three times the estimated average amount payable for the seller's reporting period or five times the estimated average amount payable for the reporting period in the case of persons habitually delinquent. Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-004.07A(1). Anyone whose permit has been previously suspended or revoked shall pay the Department of Revenue, in addition to the required security, a fee of $25.00 for the renewal or reissuance of a permit in the event of a first revocation, and $50.00 for each revocation thereafter. A new permit will not be issued to the same person until the Department of Revenue is satisfied that such person will comply with the sales and use tax statutes and regulations. Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-004.08. Markets, Trade Shows: During flea markets, craft or trade shows, conventions, or exhibitions, the Nebraska Department of Revenue imposes obligations on the promoter or operator of the event and on the sellers that seek to do business at such an event. The promoter or operator must be licensed as a retailer if the promoter agrees to collect and remit sales tax for the sellers at the event that do not have a sales tax permit. When a seller and promoter make such an agreement, the seller is not required to obtain a sales tax permit. A promoter or operator must also be licensed as a retailer if they are making taxable sales. Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-033.03. Nebraska has also placed specific reporting obligation on retailers who do business in certain convention centers. Every person collecting and reporting sales tax for taxable sales or services made on the premises of or delivered to the CenturyLink Center, Pinnacle Bank Arena, or the Ralston Arena must file a form reporting the net taxable sales, and total sales tax collected at that convention center.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Responsible Parties Tax Collection and Remittance

Vendor Liability for Sales Tax Nebraska requires the seller/vendor to collect sales tax from all applicable purchases and to remit the tax to the Department of Revenue. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2703(1)(a); Nebraska Information Guide No. 4-787-1989. The tax will be incorporated into the purchase price and will be considered a debt at law from the consumer to the retailer until the tax is collected by the Nebraska Department of Revenue. The sales tax charge must be separately stated. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2703(1)(a). If the seller fails to collect the appropriate sales tax due, then the seller is personally liable to pay the tax. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-1783.01(1). Nebraska sales tax collected by a vendor is held “in trust” by the vendor until remitted to the state. Such amounts should be held separately from the vendor's other funds and vendors may not use sales tax revenue for any other purpose. Nebraska Information Guide No. 4-787-1989. Liability for Use Tax An individual or business that uses, stores, distributes or consumes tangible personal property in Nebraska is liable for use tax. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2703(2). Goods brought into Nebraska for the purpose of storage, use, or consumption will be subject to use tax. The liability for use tax is extinguished when the retailer gives the purchaser a receipt showing that the purchaser has actually paid the sales tax due on the purchased item. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2703(2). BNA-SUTN NE 31.3.1.

Relieves Liability A seller may enter into an agreement with a Certified Service Provider(CSP) to act as its agent to perform all of the seller's sales and use tax functions, other than the seller's obligation to remit tax on its own purchases. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2711(16)(d). The Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board shall certify a service provider as a CSP only if the CSP certifies that:• it has designed and tested a system to ensure that the fundamental precept of anonymity is respected; • it only used and retained personally identifiable information of exempt purchasers to the extent necessary for the administration of model 1; • it provides consumers clear and conspicuous notice of its information practices; • its collection, use, and retention of personally identifiable information is limited to that required by the member states to ensure the validity of exemptions from taxation that are claimed by reason of a consumer's status or the intended use of the goods or services purchased; and • it provides adequate technical, physical, and administrative safeguards to protect personally identifiable information from unauthorized access and disclosure. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2711(16)(d). A CSP who has assumed filing responsibilities for a seller is allowed, on behalf of the seller, to claim any bad debt allowance if the CSP credits or refunds the full amount of any allowance or refund received to the seller.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Due Date Extensions Extensions for Disaster Relief

Allowed. The Nebraska Department of Revenue will work with businesses and individuals regarding any tax returns and taxes due, including sales tax returns, when taxpayers do not have access to their computer, files, or tax records due to a natural disaster. Penalties and interest may be abated when circumstances warrant and the law allows. Nebraska Dept. of Rev., Tax Information for Victims of Natural Disasters (last visited April 19, 2019). In accordance with Nebraska Revenue Ruling 99-09-2, Nebraska formerly followed IRS disaster relief designations and granted affected state taxpayers filing extensions that corresponded to those granted by the IRS. The department rescinded that ruling on April 9, 2019 and has moved to a case-by-case system for evaluating disaster relief. Nebraska Revenue Ruling 99-09-2 (April 15, 2009), rescinded by Nebraska Revenue Ruling 99-19-1 (April 9, 2019); Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 22-014.02D. 2019 The Nebraska Department of Revenue is granting automatic relief to taxpayers directly impacted and unable to timely file returns and make payments, as a result of the recent severe flooding impacting the state.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Payment Methods Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)

Required for Certain Taxpayers Effective Jan. 1, 2011, the Department of Revenue requires certain taxpayers to remit sales and use tax electronically if individual payments made during the year (rather than the aggregate of payments made during a calendar year) are above $5,000. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-1784(4). The Tax Commissioner may phase in, as necessary, the requirement to make electronic fund transfers. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-1784. Nebraska uses both Automated Clearinghouse Debit, and Automated Clearinghouse Credit methods of paying tax liabilities through the EFT system. Effective Jan. 1, 2011, persons that fail to make required payments through EFT will be subject to a $100 penalty for each required payment not made through EFT. This penalty will be in addition to any other penalties even if payment is made timely through some other means. However, the Nebraska Tax Commissioner may waive the penalty upon a showing of good cause. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-1784(5). BNA-SUTN NE 31.6.1.

Topic: Administration and Procedure Exemption Certificates Certificates Required

Yes Retail vendors that are required to have a state sales tax license covering retail sales made to final consumers are required to have a completed certificate of exemption to cover the purchaser's sales for resale. Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-013.02. The Nebraska Department of Revenue form for the retailer's Resale Certificate is Form 13. Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-013.11. The presentation of a resale certificate by a purchaser will relieve the seller of liability for sales tax and switch liability to the purchaser, provided all of the following conditions are met:• the resale certificate presented to the seller by the purchaser contains all the information required by the Department and has been fully and properly completed; • the seller did not fraudulently fail to collect or remit the tax, or both;and • the seller did not solicit a purchaser to participate in an unlawful claim that a sale was for resale. Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-013.02; Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 3316-1-013.03; Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-013.08. A completed exemption certificate must include:• identification information for both the purchaser and retailer; • a statement of the basis for the exemption, including the purchaser's activities; • a statement that the certificate is for a single purchaser or is a blanket certificate covering future sales; • if the paper certificate is used, an authorized signature; and • the date of issuance. Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-014. Sellers must retain exempt sale certificates, energy source exemption certificates, resale certificates, or other adequate proof to document exempt sales. Additionally, sellers must retain the exempt sales certificate or resale certificate to support deductions from gross receipts on tax returns. Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-008.01A. Exempt groups: Exempt transactions can be divided into the following four groups exempt due to:• the seller (entity-based exemption); o Only retailers that are specifically identified by regulation who are making certain types of sales qualify for this exemption from collecting the sales tax. Some examples include: specific items and services sold by Nebraska schools and sub-organizations of Nebraska schools;churches; hospitals; and other licensed health care entities. Occasional sales are also included in this group. • the item sold (product-based exemption); o Only buyers specifically identified by regulation are exempt from sales tax. Those buyers include: the U.S. government and its agencies; Nebraska state and local governments; nonprofit organizations created exclusively for religious purposes or to provide services to the blind; Nebraska educational institutions; and Nebraska licensed nonprofit hospitals, skilled nursing facilities. • the buyer (entity-based exemption); and o Only those products specifically identified by regulation qualify for this exemption. Some examples include: prescription medicines; insulin;gasoline; and food. • the buyer's intended use of the item (use-based exemption). o Only those uses specifically identified by regulation qualify for this exemption. Some examples include: items purchased to be resold as agricultural products; purchased by a manufacturer;seeds and annual plants for agricultural purposes; and feed and water for cattle. Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-014.01. Transactions exempt due to the seller or the item sold do not require exempt sale certificates, as long as the records clearly show the nature of the seller and the product being sold. Transactions exempt due to the buyer or the buyer's intended use of the item require an exempt sale certificate or other suitable documentation for tax-exempt treatment. Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-014.01. Evidentiary Value It is presumed that all gross receipts are subject to tax until the contrary is established. The burden of proving a sale is not a retail sale is on the seller. The receipt of an exemption certificate is conclusive proof for a seller that a sale was made for resale or was tax exempt. Nebraska Rev. Stat. §77-2703(1)(f). Sellers are required to procure exempt sale certificates from purchasers in support of exempt sale claims. The exempt sale certificate is a sales record and must be kept and retained in the same manner as other sales records. Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-014.02. A seller is relieved of liability for a tax if a properly completed exemption certificate is received, or the seller procures relevant information supporting the exemption, within 90 days subsequent to the date of sale or within 120 days subsequent to a request for substantiation made by the Nebraska Department of Revenue. If the seller cannot obtain an exemption certificate or supporting information, the seller will be liable for the tax. Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-014.08. Sellers that fraudulently fail to collect tax or solicit purchasers to participate in unlawful exemption claims will not be relieved of liabilities for tax, penalties, and interest. Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-014.06. Blanket Certificates A seller or certified service provider who holds an exemption certificate and who regularly makes tax-exempt purchases of the kind and nature for which the exemption certificate has been made may provide a seller with a blanket exemption certificate. A blanket certificate specifies that all tangible personal property subsequently purchased will be for the purpose shown on the certificate, such as a purchase for resale. This relieves the purchaser of providing a separate exemption certificate for each qualifying tax-exempt purchase, as long as there is no change in the character of their operations. Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-013.03D; Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-013.06; Neb. Admin. R. & Regs. 316-1-014.07. Penalties Any purchaser who gives a Form 13 exemption certificate to a seller for any purchase which is other than for resale, lease, or rental in the normal course of the purchaser's business, or is not otherwise exempted from sales and use tax under the Nebraska Revenue Act, is subject to a penalty of $100 or ten times the tax, whichever is greater, for each instance of presentation and misuse.

Any company that is engaged in multistate commerce may contact the MTC/NNP to represent them in voluntarily resolving potential state sales/use tax and income tax liabilities where nexus is the central issue. The company or their representative may prefer to work directly with the Nebraska Department of Revenue. Nebraska Info. Voluntary Disclosure Program. The formal request to participate in the program must be a written “statement of facts.”To remain anonymous when making a formal request, the company may engage a representative (such as a CPA or attorney). The written “statement of facts” must contain the following information:• a description of the company's business; • a description of the company's activities in Nebraska; • the date the company started its activities in Nebraska; • the type of tax involved; • the reasons for the noncompliance with Nebraska tax law; • a statement that the company has never filed in the past or has not been contacted by the Nebraska Department of Revenue prior to the request; • an estimate of the company's tax potential for the past three years; and • the company's proposed terms of settlement. Nebraska Info. Voluntary Disclosure Program. The Nebraska Department of Revenue considers each voluntary disclosure request separately on its own facts. Upon review of a request, the Department of Revenue will take into account the significance and nature of the company's activity, circumstances, and presence that may have established nexus; the willfulness of the disregard of the tax laws; the company's demonstration of good faith;and the overall benefits to both parties by entering a Voluntary Disclosure Agreement. Nebraska Info. Voluntary Disclosure Program. If the Department of Revenue and the company agree to the terms of the agreement, the Department will prepare the agreement. The Department has the option to waive all penalties, provided that the company pays all tax and interest. For the agreement to become valid, the company must sign the agreement, file all appropriate applications, returns, or comparable spreadsheets for the tax period within the specified time agreed upon, and pay all of the tax liability. If the company materially violates the provisions or misrepresents any facts, the voluntary disclosure agreement is null and void. Nebraska Info. Voluntary Disclosure Program. BNA-SUTN NE 31.15.1.
