State: District of Columbia



Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Real Property

Nontaxable Sales and use tax is imposed upon tangible personal property and certain services. Real property is neither tangible personal property nor a service; therefore, real property is not subject to sales and use tax. D.C. Code Ann. §47-2002; D.C. Code Ann. §47-2202. Real property is defined as the land together with improvements to the land. D.C. Code Ann. §47-802(a)(1). Tangible personal property means corporeal personal property of any nature. D.C. Code Ann. §47-2001(s). BNA-SUTN DC 28.1.

Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal General Rule for Classification

Two-Prong Test Though the District of Columbia has not provided specific guidance on determining when tangible personal property becomes a fixture to real property for sales and use tax purposes, it has relied on a two-pronged approach. See D.C. Code Ann. §47-2001(s); D.C. Code Ann. §47-2201(j); D.C. Code Ann. §47-2002; D.C. Code Ann. §47-2010; D.C. Code Ann. §47-2202. The two prongs are focused on whether the property has been actually annexed to real property according to the nature and use of the article and its adaptation to the use for which it was annexed. Donahue v. District of Columbia, 451 A.2d 85 (D.C. 1982) (citing L.P. Steuart & Bro. v. Capital View Realty Co., 112 F.2d 583 (D.C. Cir. 1940)). In tax cases, courts have not focused on the intent of the parties. Donahue v. District of Columbia, 451 A.2d 85 (D.C. 1982). For example, in Donahue v. District of Columbia, the D.C. Court of Appeals ruled that bar sinks, a dishwasher, booth dividers, a deep fryer, a grill and range, and other equipment installed into a restaurant bar were considered tangible personal property because the property was necessary to the taxpayer's business. Classification of property as tangible personal property or real property for taxation purposes does not affect the property's classification with regard to conveyance of the real estate. Donahue v. District of Columbia, 451 A.2d 85 (D.C. 1982). BNA-SUTN DC 28.2.1.
