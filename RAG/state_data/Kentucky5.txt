Topic: Real Property, Construction Contracts and Materials, Mobile and Manufactured Homes Fixtures, Classifying Property as Real or Personal General Rule for Classification

Three-Part Test Tangible personal property, including building materials, fixtures, and supplies, that are purchased to be incorporated into any structure or improvement to real estate are subject to sales or use tax when purchased by the contractor. 103 Ky. Admin. Regs. 26:070(1). The term “fixtures”means things which are accessory to a building and do not lose their identity as accessories but which do become a permanent part of the realty. 103 Ky. Admin. Regs. 26:070(2)(4). Examples of fixtures are lighting fixtures, plumbing fixtures, hot water heaters, furnaces, boilers, central heating units, elevators, hoists, burglar and fire alarm fixtures, central air conditioning and built-in refrigeration units, built-in oven-ranges and dishwashers, and cabinets. 103 Ky. Admin. Regs. 26:070(2)(4). The Kentucky Court of Appeals defined a three-part test for determining whether or not an article is permanently affixed to real property. Tarter v. Turpin, 291 S.W.2d 547 (Ky. Ct. App. 1956). The three factors to consider are: • annexation to realty, either actual or constructive; • adaptation or application to the use or purpose that the part of the realty to which it is connected is appropriated; and • the intention of the parties to make the article a permanent accession to the freehold with title to the article in the one owning the freehold. Tarter v. Turpin, 291 S.W.2d 547 (Ky. Ct. App. 1956). In Kentucky v. Anson & Clark, large capacity above-ground storage tanks were considered affixed to real property because the objective findings of the Board of Tax Appeals supported the conclusion that it was the intention of the seller and buyer of the property to treat these tanks as a fixture. The deed of conveyance specified that title to the tanks and buildings would pass to the buyer as part of the freehold interest in the land. Although the court reasoned that the intention of the parties alone was too amorphous a standard, the fact that the tanks were being depreciated, affixed to the property making it economically unreasonable to remove them, and attached to the ground through a network of pipes, supported the parties intentions expressed in the deed. Kentucky v. Anson &Clark Inc., No. 86-CI-1289 (Franklin Cir. Ct., Ky. 1987). BNA-SUTN KY 28.2.1.

Contractors for Government Agencies and Non-profits A contractor may not claim that the purchase of materials or fixtures is not subject to the tax because the property is to be used in fulfilling a contract with the federal government, state government or political subdivision, or any department, agency, or instrumentality of the federal government, state government or political subdivision, or with a religious, educational, or charitable institution. 103 Ky.
