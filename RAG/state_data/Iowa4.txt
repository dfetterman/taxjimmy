Taxable The use of aircraft subject to registration in Iowa is generally subject to tax. Iowa Code Ann. §423.5(1)(a). The use tax, rather than the sales tax is imposed on the purchase price of aircraft subject to Iowa registration, and the tax is collected by the Iowa Department of Transportation at the time the aircraft is registered. No local option sales tax applies. Iowa Code Ann. §423.5; Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-18.49; Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-31.6; Iowa Sales and Use Tax Guide. The rental of aircraft for 60 days or less is subject to Iowa sales tax. Iowa Code Ann. §423.2(6). The casual sale of aircraft also is subject to Iowa sales and use taxes. For the purposes of the casual sale rule, aircraft means any contrivance now known or hereafter invented, which is designed or used for navigation of or flight in the air, for the purpose of transporting persons, property, or both or for crop dusting, aerial surveillance, recreational flying, or for providing some other service. Examples of aircraft include balloons, gliders, helicopters, and “ultra lights.” Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-18.28(1); Iowa Sales and Use Tax Guide. If all of the following conditions are met, the sale of aircraft to an aircraft dealer who rents or leases the aircraft to another is exempt from Iowa tax: the aircraft is kept in the dealer's inventory at all times; the dealer reserves the right to immediately take the aircraft from the lessee when a buyer is found; and the lessee is aware that the dealer will immediately take the aircraft when a buyer is found. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-18.49(4); Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-32.13(2). Should the exempt aircraft be used of a purpose other than leasing or renting, or any of the above conditions no longer exist, the dealer is liable for tax that would have been due had the exemption not been allowed based on the original purchase priced paid by the dealer. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-18.49(4);Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-18.36(4). For the purposes of this exemption, aircraft refers to any contrivance known or hereafter invented which is designed for navigation of or flight in the air. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-18.49(4). Trailer Kits Iowa imposes sales and use tax on vehicle trailer kits that are purchased or used in the state. An exception is made for glider kit vehicles, that are considered new “completed motor vehicle[s]” which are subject to the one-time registration fee on the purchase price of the glider kit.

Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-32.11. The use tax imposed on the use of vehicles requiring only the issuance of a certificate of title is paid by the vehicle's owner to the county treasurer or to the Iowa Department of Transportation, who will then remit the collected amounts to the department of revenue. Iowa Code Ann. §423.26(1). Long-term Motor Vehicle Rentals The lease of motor vehicles subject to registration with gross vehicle weight rating of less than 16,000 pounds, excluding motorcycles and motorized bicycles that are actually leased for a period of 12 months or more, will be subject to a motor vehicle lease(use) tax of 5 percent based on the lease price. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-31.5. The lease price shall be computed by multiplying the number of months of the lease by the monthly lease payments, plus down payment, which shall include trade-ins and any additional costs or fees paid by the lessee. Capitalized costs paid by the lessee are generally included as part of the monthly lease payments. Capitalized costs may include, but are not limited to, rustproofing, floor mats, pin striping, management fees, reserved charges, air conditioning, stereo, mud flaps, lease acquisition fee, and finance charges. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-31.5(2). Down payment means, for the purpose of this rule, as any payment or trade-in made by the lessee for the purpose of reducing the lease price. In certain instances, costs are associated with the lease and entering into the lease, which are not refundable, that are negotiated by the lessor and lessee, resulting in an agreement that these costs will be paid by the lessee separately and in addition to the monthly lease payments. Costs for such items, whether normally capitalized or not, that are paid separately by the lessee in order to reduce the lease price, shall be treated as a down payment and shall be added in the computation of the lease price. A trade-in is treated as a down payment and is defined for the purpose of this rule as tangible personal property which is traded by the lessee to the lessor in order to reduce the lease price. The value of the trade-in shall be added in the computation of the lease price. The lease price shall not include any manufacturer's rebate or refundable deposit. Iowa Admin. Code r. 701-31.5(2). The lease price shall not include manufacturer's rebate, refundable deposit, title fee, registration fee, vehicle lease tax imposed under this rule, federal excise taxes attributable to the sale of the vehicle to the owner or to the lease of the vehicle by the owner, optional service or warranty contracts, insurance, or any finance charge imposed on these excluded items.
