Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Tangible Personal Property

Destination New Jersey applies a destination sourcing rule for the imposition of sales and use taxes. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3.1(a). Retail sales of tangible personal property and digital goods, with exceptions as noted below, are sourced under the following rules:• Where property is received by a purchaser at the seller's business location, the sale is sourced to that business location. • Where property is not received by the purchaser at the seller's business location, the sale is sourced to the place where receipt by the purchaser(or the purchaser's donee, designated as such by the purchaser) occurs, including the location indicated by instructions for delivery to the purchaser (or donee), known to the seller. • Where neither of the above rules apply, the sale is sourced to the address of the purchaser indicated by the seller's business records, so long as use of this address does not constitute bad faith. • Where none of the above rules apply, the sale is sourced to the purchaser's address obtained during the consummation of the sale, including the purchaser's address as indicated on the purchaser payment instrument, so long as use of this address does not constitute bad faith. • Where none of the above rules apply, the sale is sourced, in the case of tangible personal property, to the address from which the personal property was shipped; in the case of digital goods or computer software delivered electronically, the address from which the personal property was available from transmission by the seller; and, in the case of services, the location from which the services were provided. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3.1(a). Direct Mail Sourcing The purchaser of direct mail who does not hold a direct pay permit must provide the seller with either a direct mail form or with information showing the jurisdictions to which the direct mail will be delivered to recipients. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3.3. Where the purchaser provides the seller with a direct mail form, the seller is relieved of the obligation to collect, remit, or pay the applicable tax, and the purchaser is obligated to do so. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3.3(a)(1). Where the purchaser provides the seller with information regarding the jurisdictions to which the direct mail will be delivered, the seller must collect tax according to the delivery information provided. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3.3(a)(2). If the purchaser does not have a direct pay permit or fails to provide delivery information, the seller must collect tax in accordance with N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3.1(5), that is, based on the location of the address from which the tangible personal property was shipped. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3.3(b). Sourcing Sales of Prewritten Software Sales of prewritten software are sourced in the following manner:• if the purchaser receives the software at the seller's business location, the sale is sourced to the business location; • if the software is not received at the seller's business location, the sale is sourced to the location where receipt by the purchaser occurs, which may be more than one location; • if neither of the above rules apply, the sale is sourced to the location of the purchaser's address that is available from the seller's business records maintained in the ordinary course of business, when use of the address does not constitute bad faith; • if the above rules do not apply, the sale is sourced to the location indicated by the address of the purchaser obtained during the consummation of the retail sale, including the address of a purchaser's payment instrument if no other address is available, when use of this address does not constitute bad faith; and • if none of the above rules apply, including circumstances in which the seller is without sufficient information to apply any the above rules, the sale is sourced to the jurisdiction for the address from which the software was shipped or, if delivered electronically, was first available for transmission by the seller (i.e., the location from which the software originated).

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Services

Depends New Jersey's rules applicable to sourcing sales of services, with the exception of telecommunications services, appear to be similar to the destination-based sourcing rules for sourcing tangible personal property. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3.1(a). With respect to sourcing sales of services, the terms “receive” or “receipt”mean making first use of services. Thus, the sale of a service generally is sourced where the purchaser makes first use of the service. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3.1(e). For investigative and detective services, first use is deemed to be where the investigative report is delivered, or the purchaser's billing address if the report is delivered electronically. N.J. Admin. Code tit. 18, §24-34.3(f). Sourcing Sales of Services To Software Receipts from the sale of services to prewritten software are sourced as follows:• a retail sale of a computer-related service is sourced where the purchaser makes first use of the service, which may occur in more than one location;and • a retail sale of a post-sale support agreement, sold by the seller of software at the same time as the sale of the software itself, is sourced to the same address(es)as the retail sale of the underlying software. N.J. Admin. Code tit. 18, §24-25.8(b); New Jersey Technical Bulletin TB-51R (July 5, 2011). New Jersey's general sourcing rules are provided at the Sales and Use Tax Navigator, New Jersey 4.1. Sourcing Sales of Telecommunications Services Sales of telecommunications services are sourced under the following rules. • Telecommunications services sold on a call-by-call basis, other than mobile telecommunications services, prepaid calling services, prepaid wireless calling services, private communication services, or ancillary services, are sourced to each level of taxing jurisdiction where the call originates and terminates in the same jurisdiction, otherwise, to each level of taxing jurisdiction where the call either originates or terminates and in which the service address is located. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3.4(a). • Telecommunications services sold on a basis other than a call-by-call basis, other than mobile telecommunications services, prepaid calling services, prepaid wireless calling services, private communication services, or ancillary services, are sourced to the customer's place of primary use. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3.4(b). • Mobile telecommunications services other than air-to-ground radiotelephone service and prepaid calling service are sourced to the customer's place of primary use as required by the federal “Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act”. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3.4(c)(1). • Sales of post-paid calling service are sourced to the origination point of the telecommunications signal as first identified by either the seller's telecommunications system or information received by the seller from its service provider, if the system used to transport such signals is not that of the seller. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3.4(c)(2). • Sale of prepaid calling service or prepaid wireless calling service are sourced according to the general sourcing rules applicable to retail sales of tangible personal property, except that in the case of a sale of prepaid wireless calling service, the sale may be sourced to the location associated with the mobile telephone number if none of the sourcing rules provided in paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection a. of N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3.1 apply. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3.4(c)(3). • Sales of private communication service are sourced as follows: N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3.4(c)(4). o Service for a separate charge related to a customer channel termination point is sourced to each level of jurisdiction in which such customer channel termination point is located. o Service for which all customer termination points are located entirely within one jurisdiction or levels of jurisdiction is sourced to such jurisdiction in which the customer channel termination points are located. o Service for segments of a channel between two customer channel termination points located in different jurisdictions and which segments of channel are separately charged is sourced 50 percent to each level of jurisdiction in which the customer channel termination points are located. o Service for segments of a channel located in more than one jurisdiction or levels of jurisdiction and which segments of channel are not separately billed is sourced to each jurisdiction based on the percentage determined by dividing the number of customer channel termination points in such jurisdiction by the total number of customer channel termination points. • Sales of ancillary services are sourced to the customer's place of primary use. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3.4(c)(5). BNA-SUTN NJ 4.1.2.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Leases and Rentals

Depends The taxable situs of leases or rentals of tangible personal property, other than leases or rentals of motor vehicles, trailers, semi-trailers, aircraft, or transportation equipment, or leases or rentals based on a lump sum or accelerated basis, is determined under specifically enumerated rules. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3.1(b); N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3.1(c); N.J. Admin. Code tit. 18, §24-32.6. Leases and rentals are sourced as follows:• Where a lease or rental requires periodic payments, the first payment is sourced according to the above rules for retail sales other than leases or rentals. Subsequent payments will be sourced to the “primary property location” during the period covered by each such payment. • Where a lease or rental does not require periodic payments, the payment is sourced according to the above-listed rules applicable to retail sales other than leases or rentals pursuant to N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3.1(a). N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3.1(b)(2). The taxable situs of leases or rentals of motor vehicles, trailers, semi-trailers, or aircraft that constitute neither leases or rentals of transportation equipment under N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3.1(e) nor leases or rentals based on a lump sum or accelerated basis is determined under the following rules.• Where a lease or rental requires periodic payments, each payment is sourced to the “primary property location.” • Where a lease or rental does not require periodic payments, the payment is sourced according to the above-listed rules applicable to retail sales other than leases or rentals pursuant to N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3.1(a). N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3.1(c)(2); N.J. Admin. Code tit. 18, §24-32.6. Leases and rentals of “transportation equipment” are sourced to the location where the leased property is first transferred to the lessee, that is, either the seller's place of business or the location of delivery. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3.1(d); N.J. Admin. Code tit. 18, §24-32.6(c). Transportation equipment includes railroad cars, trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,001 pounds or more, certain passenger buses, air carriers, and containers designed for use on and component parts attached or secured on the foregoing transportation equipment. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3.1(e); N.J. Admin. Code tit. 18, §24-32.6(c)(1). Sourcing Sales of Software License Agreements Payments made in connection with a software term license or a subscription, under which periodic payments are made for continued use of the software, the initial payment is sourced in the same manner as the sale of prewritten software pursuant to N.J. Admin. Code tit. 18, §24-25.8(a). If the initial payment is sourced based on the location where receipt by the purchaser or the purchaser's donee occurs, one of the following applies:• if the seller receives information from the purchaser indicating that the location of the underlying software has changed, a subsequent payment made in connection with a software term license or renewal of a software subscription is sourced to such new location; or • if the seller has not received information from the purchaser indicating a change in the location of the underlying software, sourcing a subsequent license payment made in connection with a software term license or the renewal of a software subscription to the same location where the initial payment was sourced will not constitute bad faith. N.J. Admin. Code tit. 18, §24-25.8(c). BNA-SUTN NJ 4.1.3.

Topic: Jurisdiction and Sourcing Rules Sourcing Rules Local Sourcing

Depends The sourcing rules applicable to the sports and entertainment district sales tax that may be imposed by eligible municipalities likely are the same as the sourcing rules applicable at the state level. N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3.1. With the exception of services, the sports and entertainment district sales tax applies to the same base as the state sales tax, thus the generally destination-based state-level sourcing rules apply. Compare N.J. Rev. Stat. §34:1B-194 with N.J. Rev. Stat. §54:32B-3. The Atlantic City luxury tax and Cape May County tourism tax apply to a specific limited tax base, and the general sourcing rules do not apply. N.J. Rev. Stat. §40:48-8.15; N.J. Rev. Stat. §40:54D-4; New Jersey Sales Tax Publication ANJ-17. BNA-SUTN NJ 4.1.4.
