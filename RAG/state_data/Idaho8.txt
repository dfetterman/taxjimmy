Taxable Idaho includes within its definition of a taxable sale the furnishing, preparing or serving of food, meals, or drinks directly consumed by a purchaser;thus, food and prepared meals are subject to sales tax unless specifically exempt. Idaho Code §63-3612(2)(b); Idaho Code §63-3619; Idaho Code §63-3621;. Idaho Sales and Use Tax Publication 16 provides a list of examples of taxable and nontaxable purchases by food and drink providers. Idaho Sales and Use Tax Publication 16. Litigation Over Food Exemption Bill In March 2017, the Idaho legislature passed an exemption for food for human consumption, which was vetoed by the governor. Several legislators filed an action with the Idaho Supreme Court, seeking a writ of mandamus to compel the Secretary of State to certify the bill as law. The legislators alleged that because the governor had not issued his veto within 10 days of presentment, the bill automatically became law. Idaho Legislature, House Bill 67 Information; Nate v. Denney, 2017 BL 247829 (Idaho 2017). The court disagreed and held that because the bill had been presented to the governor after the legislature had adjourned sine die for the session, the bill was invalid. The court did not issue an opinion on whether or not the governor's veto would have been effective if the bill had been presented prior to the legislature's adjournment. Nate v. Denney, 2017 BL 247829 (Idaho 2017). BNA-SUTN ID 11.1.1.

The local resort city and county sales and use taxes generally apply to the same items as the state sales and use tax. However, the resort city local sales tax need not be applied to the same items as the state sales tax. Therefore, local jurisdictions should be consulted to determine the applicability of their respective resort city sales taxes to prepared food. Idaho Code §50-1044; Idaho Code §50-1045; Idaho Code §50-1046; 2003 Idaho H. 428 (was formerly Idaho Code §63-2602). Sales tax is due upon the sales price of food, meals, or drinks furnished, prepared, or served by any commercial establishment. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.041.02; Idaho Sales and Use Tax Publication 16. Examples of commercial establishments include:• restaurants; • cafeterias; • eating houses; • diners; • drug stores; • hotels; • nightclubs;or • any other place or organization regardless as to whether they are in the business of regularly furnishing, preparing, or serving food to the public.

Topic: Food and Food Products, Eating Establishments Prepared Food Definition of 'Restaurant' or 'Eating Establishment'

Not Defined Idaho does not define restaurant or eating establishment for sales and use tax purposes. Idaho Code §63-3609; Idaho Sales and Use Tax Publication 16 Clubs and Organizations Idaho law considers private clubs, such as athletic clubs, country clubs, and similar organizations, to be retailers of any tangible personal property sold by them, regardless of whether the sale is made to a club member or non-member. As clubs and similar organizations are treated as retailers, they are lawfully obligated to collect, remit, and report sales tax on any and all taxable transactions. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.041.03; see Idaho Sales and Use Tax Publication 16. When a club or other similar organization hosts an event on its property, maintains its own kitchen facilities, and sells tickets to the event, with the ticket price including the cost of a meal, drinks, entertainment, and nontaxable items, such as registration fees and speaker fees, the entire price of the ticket is subject to sales tax, even though registration fees, speaker fees, and similar charges are not independently subject to tax. However, if the organization separately states the charges for food (and other taxable purchases such as admission, or use of the recreational facility), only the charge for food and other taxable transactions are subject to tax. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.041.03.a. Where a club or similar organization hosts an event at a restaurant, hotel, or facility and food is provided by a third party, no sales tax is due upon the charge made to club members to attend the event so long as the club has paid the food service company the applicable sales tax. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.041.03.c. Schools, Colleges, and Universities Where the price of the food or meal is paid for in cash, sales tax applies to the total charge for the meal. When a student receives a meal plan as part of their purchase of room and board, the part of the charge representing the payment for board must be separated by the educational institution and is subject to sales tax. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.041.04.a. Sales of meals under the Federal School Lunch Program are exempt from sales and use tax. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.041.04.b. Fraternities, Sororities, and Cooperative Living Groups Generally, fraternities, sororities, and cooperative living groups purchase food and food products for use in preparing their own meals to serve to members. Such purchases of food and food products are subject to sales or use tax. However, fraternities, sororities, and cooperative living groups do not sell meals to their members, thus no sales tax is to be collected upon the provision of each meal to their members. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.041.05. However, if the fraternity, sorority, or cooperative living group hires a third party to prepare and provide food to its members, the meals provided to the group members are subject to sales tax. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.041.05.a. Also, if the fraternity, sorority, or cooperative living group regularly provides meals to the public for a price, the sales price of the meal is subject to sales tax. Idaho Regs. §35.01.02.041.05.b. Boarding Houses Boarding houses providing meals to residents as part of a lump sum charge for services are not required to collect sales tax upon the price of each meal. Where the charge of each meal is separately stated, however, the boarding house must collect sales tax on the price of each meal. Likewise, sales of meals to the public are subject to sales tax.
